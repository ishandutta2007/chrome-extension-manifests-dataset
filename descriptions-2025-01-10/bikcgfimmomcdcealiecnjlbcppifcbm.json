If you hover over those names with your mouse, while holding down the CTRL key, an image of the asset in question will automatically pop up. The CTRL key is required, as it prevents unknown, secret/spoiler information from being viewed inadvertently.\n\nThis extension helps foster better community communications, as it allows you to see the asset being discussed on various forums; in addition, it facilitates PBF (play by forum).\n\nPrivacy Policy: This extension does NOT handle user data !!!"
