It's hard. We all watch too many dang movies. I myself put nearly 1000 entries in a spreadsheet before I gave up. \n\nThere are services out there for keeping track of the things you've watched. But they all require an active effort on your part to build up your list. The automagical solutions don't help much for a Chromecast user, and they don't know when you're simply \"watching\" some random thing in the background. And none of these services give me confidence that they'll still be around in 10 years. \n\nFor a while now I've wanted a movie tracker and rater tool that I could use passively and without having to worry about data loss. So I built one. \n\nI SEENT IT! features an opinionated, dual-axis, 5-point rating system. Films and series are rated by \"rewatchability\" and \"artistic merit\". You can read more about the philosophy behind this rating system by visiting the extension's homepage. \n\nAll ratings data is synched to your Chrome profile, so if the extension becomes defunct your ratings data will remain intact. Data can be easily imported and exported in CSV format, so it's easy to migrate to or from another service. \n\nI SEENT IT! does not collect any data of any kind from users."
