The aim is to allow users to skim through material faster than normal by emphasizing parts-of-speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives, while de-emphasizing parts-of-speech such as prepositions and conjuctions.\n\nUsers can change which parts-of-speech are highlighted, change the color of the highlights, and save their own color templates. \n\nReadsy does not run automatically. Instead, a floating button is added to the browser window in the top left corner which a user can click on to execute the part-of-speech parsing. This takes all the text on the page and sends it to an API which parses through all of the text and sends back a data-object containing each word and its classification. Readsy then takes this data-object, parses through the page HTML and encapsulates each text-item with the appropriate classification."
