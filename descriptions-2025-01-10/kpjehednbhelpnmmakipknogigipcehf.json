TLH creates a more productive environment, allowing you to not open the same page multiple times (unless you really want to). \n\nFEATURES:\n\n-Highlights links to tabs already open in the following search pages:\nGoogle, Google Scholar, Amazon, and Youtube\n\n-Options page to change highlight color, whether to change the link color, and debugging.\n\n\nBUGS:\n\n-Does not handle redirects very well. This can be seen when a link is clicked, highlighted, and then unhighlighted. Not sure how to handle or fix this at this time.\n\nIf you find a bug related not related to any listed above, please let me know by leaving user feedback.\n\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\n-Accessing data on scholar.google.com and www.google.com are used to view and compare the search result links on a Google, Google Scholar, or Amazon search. This is also used to highlight the matched links.\n\n-Accessing your tabs and browsing activity is only used to view the urls of your tabs that are open currently for comparison.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\nThis extension only runs when you are doing a google search or a google scholar search. After it starts, it first reads the urls of all currently open tabs, and trims off anything after a '#'. Then it reads all of the search results urls, trimming accordingly. If any of these are exactly the same, it highlights thats result. This runs constantly every half a second, making it dynamic, so if you control-click a link to open it in a new tab, it will highlight that link if it ends up matching the rules.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n\nAfter installing, restart your browser for best results. (A simple refresh of the search page should work too.)\n\n\nVERSION CHANGES:\n\n1.1.0\nRemoved the class r option of h3 tags and added it so it looked for div > h3 > a tags. This is compatible with with all the searches now available. Added compatibility with Amazon and Youtube Searches. Removed getting rid of everything after a ? mark was removed due to that being a feature in most sites as a search. This also allowed for Youtube to be added to the list of compatibility. Basically any site that has a search items in the div > h3 > a form will more than likely be compatible. Looking into allowing for enabling and disabling certain sites by the user.\n\n1.0.2\nAdded debug option to turn on/off console logging. Added style to options page. Made to where only h3 tags with a class of r are selected, and then the a tag below that for comparison.\n\n\n1.0.1\nAdded Google Scholar compatability. Changed to remove anything after a '?' found in URLs. \n\n1.0\nInitial Release\n\n\nTODO:\n\n-allow users the option to decide which sites can/cannot work with this extension\n-allow users to decide which tags get highlighted\n-previous idea could evolve into allowing users to select which tags for specific sites, allowing for new sites to be added also by user\n-create new icon and promo screen shots (has yet to be done right)\n-Perhaps change the algorithm so that it looks for a change or update in the DOM so it isn't running every half a second.\n-Change so that it is only scanning the page on an active tab (and only if the tab's base url is part of the approved list)"
