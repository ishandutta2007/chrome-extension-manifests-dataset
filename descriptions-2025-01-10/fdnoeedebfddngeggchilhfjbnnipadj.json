You don't even want to see them in the list of the channels you follow? Well, you shouldn't be so mean... but this extension can hide those channels for you! \n\nEvery channel you choose (as shown in the first screenshot) won't appear anymore in the column of followed channels. Although it will show in any other place where it would normally appear. In the extension's pop-up, channels can be added back to the column by clicking on their names (second screenshot). Also, channels can be hidden from the pop-up if their names are typed in its text field. You can watch a demo of the extension here: https://youtu.be/GHzBn0DG8fA.\n\nCode: https://github.com/jmt-chromeextensions/TwitchHideFollowedChannel. This extension has some interesting features that are worth taking a look at, like the use of MutationObserver (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) to notice when some channel has started a new stream and it has been added to the live channels div, or the background-content-pop-up messagging. \n\nFYI: Extensions are not activated automatically when they are installed. This extension, like many others you have tried probably, starts working on all the corresponding tabs at the right moment it is installed, but this is not the default behaviour. Take in mind that if you install an extension sometime and it doesn't work on the tabs you have already open, you may need to refresh those tabs with F5 key or by clicking on the reload button located in the browser's top left corner.\n\n‚ùì Questions to think about: What is the value of a follow? How did Twitch devs know that I was going to follow more people now that followed channels are not pubicly displayed? Does a lot of people look at other people's followed channels? ü§î"
