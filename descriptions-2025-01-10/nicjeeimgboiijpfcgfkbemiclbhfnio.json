IT does this using Google Tab Groups.  It lets you set up as many rules as you want.\n\nTo add a new rule click add group button and fill out the TITLE, Domain / URL and \nCOLOR fields. When you open the open extension the TITLE column will be the tab group name. The DOMAIN/ URL column will be the value searched in the website URL field that extension uses to sort the active tab. The COLOR column will be a box that when drop down is clicked allows the user to pick a color for the tab group. These preferences will be saved to users google profile when either the save button is clicked or delete button is confirmed  and work across multiple devices with extension under same profile.\n\nIn order to change or delete  a rule you must first check the checkbox for the row and click edit or delete.  If deleting values confirm the delete in delete window.  If editing values makes sure all fields in rows are checked are not blank, and that color box is not set to grey. Otherwise a warning message will display letting you know to set these fields. \n\nThe extension works as follows, say  you have the value Test1 in Name Column, test1 in URL column, and the box set to Blue. Any website URL you visit with test1 ex.(www.test1thisisatest.com) will be automatically sorted into a group named Test1.\n\nYou can also specify multiple terms to search with by separating them with commas. For instance, if you assign a group with TITLE column of Colors, and DOMAIN/ URL of blue, yellow, and green; any url you load with those search terms will go in the Tab Group Named Color.  The final column COLOR, is the color of this tab group that gets set.\n\nBy default the following keyboard shortcuts are enabled. You can use Ctrl+Shift+Y,  Ctrl+Shift+H, and Ctrl+Shift+U to close, open and toggle tab groups respectively. You can also change this by going to chrome://extensions/shortcuts as well. \n\nThere is a settings / options page you can get to by clicking the gear in the top right corner. Here you can enable a zoomed in view for larger font size and window for the popup window, change grouping from other windows behavior, and save and load your files from a local file on your computer."
