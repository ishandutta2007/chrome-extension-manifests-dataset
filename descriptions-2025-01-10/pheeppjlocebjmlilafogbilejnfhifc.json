Please login again.\". If the form has\n  been autofilled and if that message appears then the extension will\n  automatically log you in. \n\n* Right-Clicking and doing a \"Save As...\" now works for documents other than\n  PDFs. You can now \"Save As...\" Word, Powerpoint, and probably Excel\n  documents. \n\n* A QuickClick Menu for clicking the course web page you want to get to when\n  you go in from the front page of GauchoSpace and it has auto-logged you in.\n  I don't see why I have to scroll and click those tinier links at the bottom.\n  It is much nicer to have those huge buttons on the left.\n\n* Cloned the current week to the top in the course web page \n  so the current week is right there when you get to the page.\n\n* Fixed left sidebar for course view so you don't lose it when scrolling down."
