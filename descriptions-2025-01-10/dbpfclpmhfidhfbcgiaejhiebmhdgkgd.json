This introduces an easy means of authentic opinions from web3 users & a way overall for internet users to qualitatively differentiate from the common. \n\nThe internet grows endlessly, and it is in much need of a system which can organize all this jumbled content, filter the spam & bot-gen, push up what is user-valued. Thanks to the blockchain technology, all this is made possible now in a transparent & decentralized way.\n\nThis project is open-source, ownerless & decentralized. \n\nKnow more at https://cryptostamping.org"
