Whenever you need to sign up on a website, veilmail.app generates a unique email address based on the current tab's URL. This way, you can later identify which websites share your email, as each address is tied to a specific site.\n\nAll emails sent to these addresses are forwarded to your primary inbox, like Gmail, while keeping your real email private. If spam starts coming in, you can see exactly where it originated and delete the address anytime via veilmail.app, keeping your inbox clean and secure."
