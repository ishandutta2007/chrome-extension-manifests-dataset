Instead of using a timeout (workaround), switched to the onChanged event to track the download.\n\n• v2.3.1 (2023-08-20):\n    · After recent Chrome update, extension window seems to collapse. Explicit width is set on body.\n\n• v2.3 (2023-06-10):\n    · Bug fix for title input. Formatting the value is throttled by 500ms.\n    · Added buttons for removing parameters & hash.\n    · Switched the icons to Font Awesome 6.\n\n• v2.2.1 (2023-05-23):\n    · Bug fix for closing the extension window when the download window shows.\n\n• v2.2 (2023-05-11):\n    · Added copy buttons for the title and the URL. Plus some minor UI adjustments.\n\n• v2.1 (2023-04-22):\n    · Added a link to the current page. It can be dragged-and-dropped in a directory instead of downloading the file. This is faster if the download location/folder is already open.\n\n• v2.0.4 (2022-09-07):\n    · When clicked on \"Inspect popup\", the extension throws an error. This might be because it's trying to operate on an empty string (title, url, etc). Empty strings are ignored now.\n\n• v2.0.3 (2022-05-18):\n    · On macOS, when the popup closes (after clicking the download button), it also closes the download/save window. Now, there's a 5 second delay between the download and the popup close.\n\n• v2.0.2 (2022-04-19):\n    · Auto hide/close the popup window when Download is clicked.\n    · Added description/title to the Title label.\n\n• v2.0.1 (2022-04-17):\n    · Live preview of URL change in Content.\n\n• v2.0.0 (2022-04-13):\n    · Major UI update. Previously, there was no UI. Now, the user can modify the title and the URL before downloading."
