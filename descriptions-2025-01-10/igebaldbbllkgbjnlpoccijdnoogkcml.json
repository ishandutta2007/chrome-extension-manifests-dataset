On sites like Discord or Kahoot, creating new and wacky usernames every day is part of the fun!\n\nBandNames is a tool that helps you come up with hilarious new usernames with just a few presses of a button! There is no true definition for what makes a good band name. Typically, any ridiculous pairing of an adjective and noun works well, but there are so many other good possibilities!\n\nNames can be generated from a pre-existing list or at random from a noun and an adjective. Switching between these modes is a single button press and each has a different interface that makes it easy to adhere to length requirements, generate all or half of the current suggested name, and copy the current suggestion to the clipboard.\n\nThis project is open sourced: https://github.com/ElijahMSmith/BandNames."
