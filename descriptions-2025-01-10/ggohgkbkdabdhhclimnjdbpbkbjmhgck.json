Set up your project with our automatic site builder that generates and synchronizes all the styles in your project.

Stop repeating yourself and build like a pro with GridUp.\n\nFeatures:\n\n✓ Our site builder guides you through the setup process by defining the most important styles for your project and specifying elements such as navbar, footer, and buttons. It generates a central style guide for you based on the Finsweet style system, which contains the defined styles for this project.\n\n✓ Choose your favorite components from our component library, copy them into the project, and watch the component styles and buttons sync automatically. No redundancy, no mistakes.\n\n✓ Add multiple pages with page structure at once and watch them appear fully automated with navigation bar, page structure and footer in seconds.\n\n✓ Add a page structure to existing pages and define how the classes should be merged.\n \n✓ Mark your favorite pages and components and have them at your fingertips at any time.\n\nBuild smart, GridUp."
