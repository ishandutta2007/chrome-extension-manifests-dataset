AI-Responder draws on three sources of information, such as property-specific knowledge documents, guest data, and previous chat history, to generate AI-powered responses. OpenAI GPT3 Davinci-003 and GPT NeoX 20B are being used interchangeably for the highest quality of text generated. Tests have shown that 88.2% of the responses have a quality score of 4 or 5, without the need for editing. During the beta period, the users get a 14-day free trial and a lifetime price lock of $49/month/listing for those who choose to continue. After the beta period, the pricing for the Chrome extension is estimated to be $95/month/listing. AI-responder for Hostaway is a great way to save time and effort when responding to customer inquiries. Built by Hosts for Hosts."
