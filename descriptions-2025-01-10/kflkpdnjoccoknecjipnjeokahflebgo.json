It works by presenting the user with new and more difficult lessons more frequently, while older and less difficult lessons are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect :brain:\n\nIt is commonly used for studying languages, however good tooling currently only exists for flashcard based studying systems such as Anki and SuperMemo. The Duolingo Spaced Repetition extension aims to bridge the amazing power of Duolingo with the proven methodology of spaced repetition by introducing a new study mode! :sparkles:\n\nSimply install the extension and you will see a new study mode button for spaced repetition. Use the new study mode and it will auto select your study lessons based on what evidence shows will help you retain information the best! :tada:\n\nFeatures\n- Spaced Repetition mode\n- Auto-start new lessons"
