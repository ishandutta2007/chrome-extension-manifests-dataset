Of course you can still decide to proceed to the website, but at least we warned you about the risk!\nJust surf on the net as you would usually do, when you're about to open a risky website, we'll show you a danger-alert page, that will allow you to go back in complete safety or to proceed to the dangerous-site (if you really want to).\nOur dangerous-website list is constantly updated, to guarantee you maximum safety.\nProtected Browse will change your default search to Bing, in this way we can analyze your search terms to detect potentially dangerous search results. \n\nThanks to Protected Browse, you will safely browse the web!\n♥It can be used in combination with your antivirus.\n♥It's totally free.\n\nTo uninstall the extension, follow the instructions below:\nPrivacy Policy: https://protectedbrowse.com/privacy\nEULA: https://protectedbrowse.com/eula"
