This list resets every time you close and open chrome, so make sure to enter it whenever you want to keep track of your productivity! This is especially useful if you want to stay off of a certain website during a work period.\n\nThere are a couple of websites that are automatically marked as \"Unproductive Websites.\" These are Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Discord, and Reddit.\n\nOwltivity grades your productivity on a simple 5 grade letter scale (A, B, C, D, and F). The grades are calculated as such: your unproductive time is compared to your total time spent browsing, and the ratio corresponds to your letter grade.\n\nThe exact breakdown is shown below:\n\nA: 0.9 - 1\nB: 0.8 - 0.9\nC: 0.7 - 0.8\nD: 0.6 - 0.7\nF: < 0.6\n\nSpecial thanks to FM Productions (https://tinyurl.com/y3f2x9ro)\nfor his time tracking Javascript implementation."
