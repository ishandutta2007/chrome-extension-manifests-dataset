You can check that out here: https://ourforest.io \n\n➤ Why should I care about reforestation?\n\nTree planting has the power to transform lives in so many ways. When we plant trees, we hire local communities and do the research to know what native ecosystems we should be restoring.\n\nMost of our tree planting is focused in biodiversity hotspots around the world, which are often the most affected by poverty, poor regulation and as a result deforestation. This affects both the local people’s ability to farm and their protection against natural disasters, but also the habitats of endangered species.\n\nYour trees help fight poverty, protect land, and instate rules and regulation that protect the local communities ran by the communities. \n\nOur partner Eden Reforestation Projects takes meticulous measures to make sure the trees are not only planted in the places that need them most, but also nurtured and protected as they mature to maximize the impact they will have in the ecosystem.\n\n➤ So what are you waiting for?\n\nInstall OurForest and start making a difference today. \n\nFuture you will be thankful. 💚 💚 💚"
