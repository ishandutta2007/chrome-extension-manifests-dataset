The intended impact of this \"warning label\", is to fill gaps in the public's understanding of social media's negative health consequences and dangers to society. It is intended to be used as a productivity tool, inspired by Google's Digital Wellbeing Experiments as an idea and tool that can help people find a better balance with technology. Inspired by the public's interest in \"social dilemma\" issues, and the awareness that there may be a dangerous human impact of social networking, there may be significant interest from users to willingly install this extension to purposely remind them of modern issues with social media."
