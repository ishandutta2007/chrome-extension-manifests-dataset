Tired of scrolling or pausing just to read comments? We got you.\n\nComments now appear to the right of the video player, and suggested videos are moved underneath the video player.\n\n----------\n[Updates]\n\nThank you so much for your comments! I do read all of them and appreciate your feedback.\n\n1.0.4\n* Fixed the extension breaking due to YouTube layout changes. Thank you all for your quick bug reports.\n\n1.0.3\n* Fixed a bug where comments would only swap after refreshing the page.\n* Migrated to Manifest V3 (new thingies from Google) before it becomes mandatory. Will be monitoring closely for bugs."
