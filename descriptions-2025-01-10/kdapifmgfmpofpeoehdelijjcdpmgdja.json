Add pages or links to your readinglist for later reading.\nReview your readinglist from the extension popup in the top right corner of your screen.\nWhen signed in, the readinglist can be synced to your account, so you can use it on other devices as well.\n\nRead an item by clicking on the item in the popup. This will remove the item from the list, reducing the length of the readinglist with each click.\n\nFind a readinglist item by filtering or sorting, or just pick a random readinglist item by clicking the 'random' button.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me. You can contact me through the support section of this plugin in the Chrome web store.\n\nNOTE: this extension is free of charge and does not contain any ads.\n\nPermission needed for:\n- bookmarks: we store all reading list items in a separate bookmarks folder. This will also enable auto syncing when signing into Chrome\n- tabs: when adding a reading list item, we need to read the url and the title of the active tab\n- storage: remember filters, so next time you open the extension, it looks exactly like you left it previously"
