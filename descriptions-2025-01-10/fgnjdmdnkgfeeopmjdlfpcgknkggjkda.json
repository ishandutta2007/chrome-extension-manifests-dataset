Might not work in other ad servers.\n\nCurrently supports Swiffy, GASP, and Adobe Edge HTML 5 code\n\nNote: In case you run into a tag that is not supported, the tag processor is doing two key modifications described below. Please use them as guidelines for modifying HTML 5 tags you receive from a client.\n\n1) Adds a Javascript variable within script tags above the <div> layer that contains the entire creative. Example: <script> var clickTag = \"\";</script> This declares a clickTag variable that may be used by the HTML later.\n\n2) The tag processor then looks for a <div> tag that is typically marked with the attribute \"container\" such as <div class=\"container\">. It then adds the following Javascript method to use the clickTag variable declared earlier to make the entire <div> container layer (which contains the entire creative) and make it clickable: onclick=\"window.open(window.clickTag)\" . Full example below: <div class=\"container\" onclick=\"window.open(window.clickTag)\" onmouseover=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\"> note: \"onmouseover\" attribute is added to trigger the browser to use the value for the \"style\" which sets a finger pointer for the cursor (to tell the user that the banner is clickable)."
