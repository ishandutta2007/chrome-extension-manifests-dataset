Bookmarklets run JavaScript on a page for you when you click on the bookmark.  But how inconvenient to have to click a bookmark every time you visit a site?\n\nWhat if you could have your JavaScript simply run on the site as the page loads with no extra effort from you?  That's what this extension is about.\n\nCustom Site JS allows you to Add, Edit, or Delete snippets of custom JavaScript, that will automatically be run on a page for you based on a URL you provide.  You can create as many as you like.  The only limit is a maximum of 5 megabytes as the scripts are stored in your local storage.\n\nEverything is stored and run locally.  This extension will never make any kind of external web request, network requests, or in short send any of your information anywhere.  The only way it will pass any information outside of your local environment is if you create a snippet of JavaScript that explicitly sends information somewhere."
