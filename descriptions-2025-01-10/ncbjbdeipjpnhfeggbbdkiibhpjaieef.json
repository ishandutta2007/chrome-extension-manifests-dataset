It won't cure you, but hopefully you'll suffer less.\n\nThe Context\n\nI tend to open and reopen the very same tabs again and again, just to refresh their content. I've usually got lots (150+ on several browser windows) of open tabs, and even with the use of some Chrome extensions it takes too much time to find the one I want to refresh. So, since my Bookmarks Bar is full, and I reopen the website I want to read once again. And again. And again.\n\n\nThe Need\n\nI don't want to care anymore about duplicated tabs. Please remove them for me, oh mighty browser, whenever I open another tab with a link already present somewhere else.\n\n\nThe Result\n\nWhenever the user opens a new tab, either via CTRL/CMD+click on a link or Right click -> Open in new tab, the extension looks for any other open tabs with the very same url and close them if found.\n\nYou can enable/disable the extension by clicking on the extension action icon.\n\n\nIs it safe?\n\nDDT requires two kind of permissions from Chrome:\n\n-tabs: to access the tabs list with their urls\n-storage: to save the enabled/disabled state\n\nIt does not:\n\naccess the network (in any way, not even for checking for updates)\nread the contents of the opened pages\nIt could:\n\nclose some tabs you don't want to close: this extension is in Beta stage. I've never lost anything I did not expect to lose in all the testing I did, but please don't hold me responsible if anything bad happens\nKnown limitations\n\nIt activates only when the user requests a new tab, not when you are clicking on a link that opens a new tab\nIf you really want a duplicate tab, you can open a blank tab (only one a time ;) ) and then paste the link\nIf a link/bookmark does a redirect in more than 250ms, thus changing the tab url or scheme (i.e. http page redirecting to the same page served in https) later, it won't be matched"
