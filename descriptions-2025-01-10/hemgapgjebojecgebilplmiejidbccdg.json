The difference is, this extension supports many features that the \"Find on page\" tool does not such as:\n\n- Case sensitive search\n- Regular expression search\n- Copy matching terms to clipboard\n\nWhy use this extension over other similar extensions? This extension checks for matches within HTML elements that other extensions don't support like:\n\n- input\n- textarea\n- shadow DOM\n- frameset\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: How do I open this extension?\nA: You can open this extension by clicking on the Extensions menu in the toolbar of your browser and then clicking \"Findr\", or by using the quick key: Ctrl + Shift + F\n\nQ: What do I enter in the search box?\nA: You can choose to enter plain text like you would with Chrome's \"Find on page\" tool, or you can enter regular expressions. This extension supports JavaScript regular expressions. For more information on writing JavaScript regular expression please visit their documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions#writing_a_regular_expression_pattern\n\nQ: Why aren't matching terms being highlighted?\nA: If there are matching terms on the webpage that are not being highlighted, please reload the webpage and try again. If the issue persists please reach out to findr.extension@gmail.com"
