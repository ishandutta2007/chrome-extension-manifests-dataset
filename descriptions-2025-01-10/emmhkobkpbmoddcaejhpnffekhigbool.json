Using Measur you'll know exactly how far you've gone as a physical distance.  Every inch or centimetre is recorded for posterity, so when you ask yourself what you've done all day, you'll know the extent of your Tumbles.\n\nEach time you enter a Tumblr tab, Measur begins recording your travel.  Every tab receives an individual distance counter, as part of its title, which updates when you navigate to a new Tumblr page.  As well, a cumulative total is maintained and accessible by the button in the upper right corner.\n\nThe options page give you your choice of units, metric or imperial, as well as the ability to reset your total back to zero whenever you want."
