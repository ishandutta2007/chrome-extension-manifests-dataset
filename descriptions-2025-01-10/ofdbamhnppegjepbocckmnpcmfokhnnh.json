This Chrome extension is built specifically for this purpose. Anytime during the sprint if an idea or thought comes to mind, just pop open the Retro Notes Chrome extension and make a note of it. \n\n3 fields are provided to write about what went well, what didn't go well and an additional notes field to capture things like actions points, shout-outs, etc.\n\nSuper excited for you to start using this and keen to hear what you think about it!"
