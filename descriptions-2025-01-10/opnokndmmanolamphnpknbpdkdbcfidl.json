For example if your module has a source \"\"clouddrove/labels/aws\"\" it will convert it to \"https://registry.terraform.io/modules/clouddrove/labels/aws/latest\"  This is available on the page or you can click the sleepy cat icon to get a table view of all the modules found on the page.  If there are no modules found then it will display No Modules Found.  This is useful for looking at terraform code and being able to see what a module does in seconds. The extension currently supports sources of type SSH, Uri, registry, private registry, and file path.  This extension is Open Source and is under the GPL-3.0 License.  If you want to see the code head over to https://github.com/NickSpaghetti/Github-SSH-To-URI-Chrome-Extension .  I would love for you to contribute to this project!"
