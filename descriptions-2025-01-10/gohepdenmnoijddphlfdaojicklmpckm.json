This extension is not created nor endorsed by Facebook. All Facebook related content is owned by Facebook, including portions of the screenshots shown.\n\n\nNOTICE!!!\nFacebook appears to have done away with the pages this extension relied on. I will investigate alternatives when I have time, but until then this application will not function correctly.\n\n\n      INFO\n---------------------\n  \n * Introduction\nThis is a simple Chrome extension that can be used to easily access additional posts/photos on a Facebook profile\n\n\n\n * How to Use\n#: Make sure the active tab is the desired account to search. The URL will look something like \"https://facebook.com/firstname.lastname/...\" or \"https://facebook.com/profile.php?id=profile_id/...\"\nThe extension should work on any page of the user's profile.\n\n#: In the event of issues, try clicking on the timeline again and refreshing the page. Sometimes the al:android:url only displays fb://feed instead of fb://profile/profile_id, but usually refreshing the page fixes this\n\n#: Some profiles with maximum privacy settings may not work, but they are rare. Try refreshing the page and trying again.\n\t \n\n\n\n * Creator\nSam\n\n    CHANGELOG\n---------------------\nV0.9.0: Added Photos Uploaded, as well as Videos Uploaded and Tagged.\nV0.9.1: Changed title to avoid app takedown.\nV0.9.2: Changed stylesheet. App was taken down, pending approval to be added back to store.\nV1.0.0: Major overhaul to background script. All processing is now handled in one function, and a fallback process was added to pull the profile_id from a new location in the event that the normal method fails. Searching is now possible from any of the user's profile pages.\nV1.1.0: Changed stylesheet again, made buttons smaller so extension no longer has scrollbar.\nV1.2.0: Refactored and reorganized code to be more human readable. Extension now checks three tags for the profile_id, so it should rarely fail. Extension can now be used from search tabs already opened."
