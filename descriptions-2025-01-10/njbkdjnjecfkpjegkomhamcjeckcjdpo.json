Using advanced algorithms, Whimble scans job posts for red flags like outdated listings, resume farming indicators, and lack of specific hiring details. By analyzing these factors, Whimble assigns a \"ghost likelihood\" score to each listing, helping you avoid the time and effort of applying to jobs that may not lead anywhere. Focus your energy on real opportunities with Whimble, and make your job hunt more effective and less frustrating."
