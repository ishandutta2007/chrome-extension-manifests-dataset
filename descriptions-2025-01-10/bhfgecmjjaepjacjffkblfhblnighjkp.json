Pause, play, or skip forward and back from either video, and Reaction Channels chrome extension will keep the other video in step.\n\nPopular Youtube Reactors sometimes record their reaction without the embedding the source video. This respects the copyright of the original source material, while allowing subscribers to watch their reaction if they play back their own legitimate version of the source video.\n\nReaction Channels chrome extension makes this simultaneous playback a more pleasant experience, you can customise the length of the reactor's introduction, and be sure both videos play back together, so their reactions match the source video."
