Please navigate to the setup home page where you can find the extension injected in the right. \n2) You need to authorize (this is a one time activity) for the application to make the API calls. \n3) On clicking the button, you will be navigated to the Salesforce to authorize. Once you have successfully completed the authorization, you will be redirected back to the home page. \n4) Once this is done, all the functionalities will be enabled.\n\nHow to use it (Classic):\n\nBoth the below section get added in the set-up pages, so this is only useful for developers and Admins, this tool will not make any sense for salesforce users.\n\n1) Advanced Quick Find section:This part gets added in side navigation bar on all set-up pages. Select the code component that you want to go to, then start typing the name of the code,an autocomplete suggestion pops up, select the one that you want to go to.\n\n2) Developer Utilities: \n\t2.1) This component get added in force.com home page only. Let's say you want to know where you have hard-coded a profile name in your code, like if(profile.name =='sys Admin'){//you're doing something}. Right now to find this out you have to either go thru all the code individually or create a force.com project in eclipse and then search there. There's no way we can do this directly in salesforce. This string search will help you do that. You have to check the code components in which you want to search the code, enter a string in the input text field and hit enter. You will be presented with a list of code components where the string is used.\n\t2.2 ) Code Coverage Extract: You can View and download the code coverage in your org.\n        2.3 ) This extension now allows you to lint the lightning code via the Lightning Linter tab. \n        2.4 ) You can now run PMD against your code\n        2.5 ) Added a new tab which will allow the users to view the record and its child information .\n\nupdate 1.26\n GraphQL Explorer is now available\n\nupdate 1.22\nImproved the static code analysis functionality\n\nupdate 1.20\nMoved away from heroku to firebase functions. \n\nupdate 1.17\nLWC editor now has linting capabilities.\n\nupdate 1.15\nAdded the LWC Editor with Autocompleting for html & xml files.\n\nupdate 1.10\nAdded the ability to get the record Information by just giving the record Id. \n\nupdate 1.8, 1.9\nAdded support for the application to work on lightning\n\nupdate 1.4.2\nAdded support for Custom label\nAddes support for Apex PMD\n\nUpdate 1.1.1\nExpanded the quick search scope to Email Templates, Validation Rule, Workflow Rule, Custom Object\nAdded edition checks. \n\nUpdate 1.2\nUpdate the UI to be more in sync with Lightning \n\nUpdate 1.3 \nAdded Code coverage Extract section allowing user to view and download the code coverage.\n\nUpdate 1.3.3:\nUPdated the cookie issue.\nNOTE:\n1) Salesforce's REST API is used to accomplish the above functionalities\n\nUpdate 1.3.5\n1) Added support to delete all the Debug logs\n2) Added a button on traceflag to renew the startDate / expiration date.\n\nupdate 1.4:\n1) Added functionality to support linting of lightning components"
