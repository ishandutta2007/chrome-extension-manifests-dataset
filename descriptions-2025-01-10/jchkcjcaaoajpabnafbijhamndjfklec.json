Whenever you feel yourself floating off into distracting website land, just click the extension icon and all of your distracting websites will be blocked! When you encounter a new website that you wish to add to your list you may also do so, by opening the extension dialog menu and adding either the full or base URL.\n\nCatch yourself looking up distracting topics (sports, politics, etc)? Add that keyword to the list as well, blocking all urls with that term.  Of course, unblocking is just as easy - just remove the website/keyword from the list.\n\nUse two simple keyboard shortcuts, for  starting your work session and adding a current website to your block list.\n\nLastly, enjoy a simple timer that displays exactly how long you have been in work mode - try to set a new personal best!\n\nTo view more of my work, visit my website here: alexbudilovsky.com\nTo view the source code for this extension, go here: https://github.com/alexbudy/work_mode\n\nThank you for considering my extensions, and I appreciate all feedback!"
