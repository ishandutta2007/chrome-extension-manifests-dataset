Code that you write with Runpython will execute entirely within your browser and use no server resources. Runpython is based on the open source projects: Brython Server (https://github.com/tiggerntatie/brython-server) and Brython (http://brython.info/). Runpython does not track its users or store personal identifying information.\n\nGraphics-based programs can be written using the Ggame (https://ggame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) graphics API that is automatically supported by Runpython. In addition, turtle applications are supported with minor code changes (see the Brython Server readme).\n\nRunpython uses your Google Drive for storing Python source code. If you share your source files in Google Drive, then they will be available for other people to use with Runpython. Runpython also supports using Github as a file store."
