Normally, Clarity will forward you to the login page, and once you login, it takes you to the main dashboard, NOT the resource you requested. With this extension, after login, you will be automatically forwarded to the URL you initially requested. This saves time and frustration when sharing links with other lab mates, and reduces the amount of new tabs you have open. In addition, if the system logs you out due to inactivity, when you log back in it will automatically take you to the page you left off on, increasing productivity and reducing the chance of error from having to locate the project you were on."
