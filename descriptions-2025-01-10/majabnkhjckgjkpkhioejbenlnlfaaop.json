In just a few clicks, you go from indecipherable spreadsheet data to beautiful visualizations and explanations – allowing you to make better decisions, faster.\n\n➤ Just Added: CSV Support\nAs of version 1.0.5, you can generate ranked-choice results from CSV files. That means you can now use your preferred spreadsheet, survey, and polling tools – you're no longer locked in to just Google Forms and Sheets. \n\n➤ How it Works\nRankedVote analyzes the data in your current spreadsheet. It then extracts each voter’s rankings and saves it to your computer – optimized for the default format for “multiple choice grid” questions coming from Google Forms.\n\nWhen you click “View Results in RankedVote,” the saved data is imported into the RankedVote web application where you get instant calculations, dynamic round-by-round visualizations, and clear explanations of your results.\n\n➤ What’s Included\n\n~ Starter (free)\nThe starter version of RankedVote for Google Forms and Sheets gets you going immediately and is perfect for small group decisions.\n• No account required\n• Save unlimited sheet data to your computer\n• Prepare, Update, and Delete your data\n• Dynamic Result Visualizations and Explanations\n• Single-winner or Multi-winner results\n• Calculations limited to 15 voters (great for business teams, book clubs, small classrooms) \n\n~ Pro (paid)\nThe pro version removes the calculation limit – allowing you to instantly visualize results from thousands of voters in RankedVote.\n• Everything in Starter\n• RankedVote account\n• Premium support\n• No calculation limit (great for large groups, online contests, and more)\n\n➤ Why Ranked-Choice Voting?\nAny time you're making a decision with more than two choices, ranked-choice voting is the right tool for the job. It uncovers your participants’ preferences with greater accuracy and fidelity than traditional voting methods. Ranked-choice voting makes sure you’re choosing the option with the strongest support, not just the one with the most vocal minority."
