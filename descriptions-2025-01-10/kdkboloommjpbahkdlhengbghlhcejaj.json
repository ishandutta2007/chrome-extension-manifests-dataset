It has built-in options to resize and color these controls, as well as moving the margins to easily reach buttons regardless of your screen size!\n\nTo use, simply install the extension and open or refresh Stadia! Click the extension icon to show configuration options. Please visit the GitHub page (click the Website link) for info on using TouchStadia on Android!\n\nTo move buttons around, press CTRL+; in Stadia and layout mode will be activated (indicated by a magenta background.) Tap/click and drag buttons to change their positions during this time. Press CTRL+; again to disable layout mode. This hotkey will not work when Stadia is in-game. This is a known issue, so to ensure function please only use this shortcut outside of games for now.\n\nKeep in mind that once you change the position of a button in layout mode, that button will no longer move relative to the window border when resizing your browser, so you must maintain the same browser window size for the layout to look consistent. If you create a layout, then shrink your browser, it's possible to lose buttons outside the visible area! To reset the layout, press the Reset button in the TouchStadia configuration.\n\nIf you'd like to test the extension, but would rather not wait for Stadia to open a game, TouchStadia also runs on https://html5gamepad.com for testing purposes!\n\nIf you would like to make a suggestion, report an issue found while playing games on Stadia with TouchStadia, or would like to view the list of currently known issues an suggestions, please visit the GitHub issues page here: https://github.com/ihatecsv/TouchStadia/issues\n\nMade in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦"
