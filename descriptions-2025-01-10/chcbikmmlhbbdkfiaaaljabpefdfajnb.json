It pulls the edit history of a Google Docs document and turns the history data into a writing process report. This report displays the writing process as several charts. In the process report, we can explore copy-paste events, how frequently and when breaks were taken, typing fluency, time spent on each paragraph, time allocated to revision versus initial drafting, and total typing time.\n\n🛠 How to Use the Extension?\n➛ Step 1: Add this extension to your browser.\n➛ Step 2: Open your Google document.\n➛ Step 3: Find the “View Process Report” button near the menu bar and click on it.\n\n❌ I Am Unable to Install the Extension.\n➛ To install any Chrome extension, you need to log in to Chrome.\n➛ Please reload the Google Docs page after installing the extension.\n➛ Your institution’s IT department may need to approve installing any new Chrome extension.\n\n🔗 How to Share Your Process Report With Others?\n➛ Share Link: Copy the URL of the report link and share it.\n➛ Share PDF: In the sidebar, click “Download Process Report” to obtain a PDF of the process report.\n\n👤 Who Is It For?\nThe extension is primarily designed for students to self-reflect on their writing process. Students can also share their writing process reports as a link or download the report as a PDF file to share with their peers or teachers.\n\n⚙️ How Does It Work?\nThe extension pulls all the edit history of your Google Doc, which is already maintained by Google, and turns the writing journey into an interactive process report.\n\n📚 How Can Teachers Integrate It Into a Course?\nPlease visit www.processfeedback.org/gdocs for step-by-step instructions on how to integrate the extension into your course.\n\n✨ How Is It Different From Other Extensions?\nUnlike extensions like Draftback, this extension provides many rich features. Students can also download a PDF report or simply share a link to their process report.\n\n⚠️ Limitations\nThe extension is not well-tested with large documents with 100K+ changes or 100K+ characters. Its text styling also is not perfect yet. If you run into issues using the extension, please email us at contact@processfeedback.org.\n\n📜 Terms and Conditions\nBy installing the extension, you agree to and acknowledge the terms and conditions at https://processfeedback.org/terms/.\n\n🔒 Privacy Policy\n➛ Gdoc Process Feedback collects the edit history of the Google Document so the process report can be shared as a link. Collected data is stored only so that users can view reports with the process report link. Also, collected data are automatically deleted after six months, and the links expire.\n➛ For co-edited documents, always obtain permission from all co-authors before viewing or sharing process reports.\n➛ If your document contains sensitive information and you do not need a public link, please use the “Download process data” option to explore your writing process locally.\n\n📖 Please Cite\nAdhikari, Badri; “Thinking Beyond Chatbots’ Threat to Education: Visualizations to Elucidate the Writing or Coding Process”; Education Sciences; 2023."
