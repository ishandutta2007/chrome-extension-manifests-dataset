This extension activates a random effect on a site after a certain amount of time.\n\nIn the extension options, you can choose which effects you want to get and which ones you don't want to get. You can also change how long it takes for a new effect to activate.\n\nPossible Seizure Warning: I've checked and I'm pretty sure everything's fine, but if you suffer from epilepsy and an effect or something becomes an issue, then immediately click off the tab and disable the effect that's causing problems."
