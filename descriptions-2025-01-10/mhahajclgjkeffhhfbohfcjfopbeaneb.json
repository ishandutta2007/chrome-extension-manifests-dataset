With everything happening very fast it's often difficult to go to another site to run a scan on a contract just to come back and see it hit an all time high. \n\nThis extension will bring the most useful tools all in one spot making avoiding honeypots that much easier. \n\nMake sure to join our discord as we journey through the defi space."
