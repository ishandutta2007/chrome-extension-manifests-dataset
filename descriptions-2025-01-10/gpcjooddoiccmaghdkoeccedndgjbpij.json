Add cards in the console\n\nRecord new words/slang/abbr on the console (https://flappypedia.com). The recording flow is simple, like writing a “light wiki”.\n(Every new user is in our official space by default, in which we have recorded a lot of common glossaries. We will keep adding new terms in this space.)\n\n2.The knowledge will fly to you\n\nOnce a word/slang/abbr is recorded in space, each time the space members meet this word in docs, gmails, or confluence pages, the word would be underlined. And when users hover over it, a card with details will appear nearby.\n\nWHAT PLATFORMS DOES FLAPPYPEDIA WORK NOW?\n\nFlappypedia now supports 3 apps: Google Doc, Gmail and Confluence. We are extending more apps.\nhttps://flappypedia.com"
