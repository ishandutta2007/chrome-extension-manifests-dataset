The reason is because what we see is made up of pixels, tiny areas of color that form the whole image. Our eyes have to constantly focus and relax to read pixels, which puts more stress on our eye muscles. A good way to ensure your eyes get some rest is the 20-20-20 rule, which recommends that people using digital devices should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes.\n\nHow does it work? \nLUMES 20-20-20 can help reduce eye strain by prompting you to take regular breaks from the screen. The default settings are 20 minutes with 20 seconds rest. If you want to make the timer and break shorter or longer thatâ€™s possible too. \n\nFeedback? \nHelp us keep LUMES 20-20-20 working for you.
