They often screenshot the homepage, go in Photoshop and make the job themself. This extension just requires you to upload your thumbnail and type the title of your video and you're done!\nYou also have pretty interesting options such as:\n* Placing your thumbnail randomly on the homepage so you have to try to find it yourself and see if it's efficient or not.\n* Dark mode\n* Does not requires you to login and give your credential\n* Remembering your last submission\n\nThis is an open source extension so you can go on the repository of the extension and contribute or ask for new features.\nThis extension has been created and developed by YouTuber Benjamin Code during a live stream on Twitch. The design has been realised by BastiUI during a live stream on Twitch.\nLot of differents contributors developed good features for the project.\nIt's an open source project that we hope will help a lot of creators."
