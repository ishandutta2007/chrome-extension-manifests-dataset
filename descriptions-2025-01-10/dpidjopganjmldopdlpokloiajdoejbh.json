This is especially useful when you have a list of URLs that you need to open and review, but don't want to manually open each one.\n\nTo use Link Opener, simply click on the extension icon to open the popup interface, input the list of URLs (each on a new line), specify the interval in seconds, and click the \"Start\" button. The links will then be opened in new tabs at the specified interval.\n\nLink Opener is perfect for researchers, students, or anyone who frequently works with multiple URLs at once. It is designed to save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on the task at hand."
