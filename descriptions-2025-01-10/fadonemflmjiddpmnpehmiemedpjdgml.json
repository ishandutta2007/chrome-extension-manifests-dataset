For example, red could represent \"Critical,\" blue \"Learning,\" and green \"Finances.\"\n\n🖌️ Custom Color Groups: Add custom color groups that appear in the color picker on calendar events. Each color in the group can be customized with a unique color and label, helping you organize events by project, priority, or any category you need. You can also generate random colors for a group, saving time when setting up new categories.\n\n🔍 Eyedropper Tool for Custom Colors: The extension includes an eyedropper tool, allowing users to pick any color from the screen to use in their custom palette, providing even more flexibility in color customization.\n\n🔄 Reset and Disable Options: Users can clear all custom colors in a single step or disable custom colors if they only wish to use the categorization feature with Google Calendar’s default colors.\n\n🧩 Templates for Easy Setup: When adding a new color group, choose from pre-made templates.\n- ⏳ Time Blocking – Organize your day by activity type\n- ⚠️ Priority – Mark the urgency and importance of events\n- ⚡ Energy Levels – Match tasks to your energy state\n- 📅 Schedule Type – Differentiate between types of commitments\n- 📂 Projects – Track different work streams\n- 🧠 Focus Mode – Categorize by mental engagement type\n- 😊 Mood – Track emotional states and satisfaction\n- 💼 Value – Categorize by value generation type\n\n⚠️🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES AND WARNINGS 🚨⚠️\n\n🛠️ Dependency on Google Calendar Layout: this extension relies on Google Calendar's current layout. Changes to the layout by Google may temporarily break some features. If this happens, please:\n\n- Reach out via email: ali@humanquest.net\n- Visit: https://humanquest.net\n\nYour feedback helps improve and maintain this free extension.\n\n💻 Desktop-Only Compatibility: This extension is only available for Google Calendar on desktop, as Chrome extensions do not work on mobile devices. For the best experience on mobile, categorize and use Google core colors, then add custom colors on top that would only show on the web.\n\n🖌️ Changes Apply to Existing Events Only\nColor changes only take effect for existing events. Unfortunately, new events cannot be assigned colors during creation since they lack unique IDs until saved. Once the event is created and an ID is generated, you can apply the desired color.\n\n🙏 Free Extension: This extension is completely free, so I kindly ask users to be understanding and reach out if they encounter issues rather than leaving a negative review."
