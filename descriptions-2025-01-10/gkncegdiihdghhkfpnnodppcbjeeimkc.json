This extension is required for customers using Senso Cloud to monitor Chromebook devices and can be used with existing Senso Client licenses, subject to your license limits. \n \nFor help and support, please visit https://support.senso.cloud.\n \n-----\n \nStudent Safety Tools:\nEnsure student safety on school-owned Chrome devices with our safeguarding software. Senso.cloud detects harmful or inappropriate behaviour and promptly alerts designated staff about users who may be vulnerable, at risk, or potentially pose a threat to others.\n \nPowered by advanced, AI-driven visual threat analysis, Senso.cloud provides continuous 24/7/365 monitoring. Every student keystroke log is logged with a corresponding screenshot, enabling Designated Safeguarding Leads (DSLs) to thoroughly review incidents and assess their severity using their expertise.\n \n-----\n \nClassroom Management:\nSenso.cloud's teacher tools have been developed to empower teachers, giving full control, regardless of where you are. Monitor and teach students more effectively by blocking distractions and working collaboratively.\n \nLive Thumbnail View gives teachers the confidence to ensure their students are engaged and on-task. View a single student's screen or multiple screens at once in just a few clicks.\n \n-----\n \nContent Filter:\nA cloud-based, category-based web content filter that appropriately filters and blocks students from harmful or inappropriate content. Devices provided to students to take away from school are protected by Senso's Content Filter with the same protective measures in place, while on and off your network."
