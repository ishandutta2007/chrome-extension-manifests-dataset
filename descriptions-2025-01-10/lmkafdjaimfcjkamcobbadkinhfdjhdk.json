We are devoting a lot of hours into researching the contents of dozens of leading providers of Somali news. We hope to encourage more accountable and accurate reporting of news, and shed light on irresponsible and sources of disinformation. We will roll out a number of websites that we rate as we do it. The methodology was adapted from NewsGuard. Questions and feedback can be sent to us via our the extension links."
