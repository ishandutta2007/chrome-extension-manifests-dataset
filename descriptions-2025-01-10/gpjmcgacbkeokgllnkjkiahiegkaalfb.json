You can bulk delete Slack messages, clear chat histories, or even handle tasks like removing yourself from direct message conversations. Dive into the future of Slack conversation management and clear those unread, outdated, or unnecessary messages with precision and ease.\n\n🚀 NEW UPDATED VERSION - 2023\n  ⭐️ The only tool tailored for the new Slack interface with unmatched compatibility.\n\n🚀 Did you know?\n  ⭐️ Team Owners and Admins can export message and file history from Slack.\n  ⭐️ With Compliance Exports enabled the exports include messages and files even from private channels and direct messages.\n\n🚀 Why should you use it?\n  ⭐️ It gives you peace of mind knowing that sensitive or temporary discussions won't be accessible in the long run.\n  ⭐️ Regular deletion of messages can protect individual user privacy, ensuring personal conversations or details are not left lingering indefinitely.\n  ⭐️ It minimizes the digital footprint, reducing potential vulnerabilities or exposure points.\n\n🚀 Why should your organization use it?\n  ⭐️ It helps in maintaining a professional environment, especially when new team members join and review past communications.\n  ⭐️ For organizations, it can assist in adhering to data retention policies or standards.\n  ⭐️ It can help reduce the amount of data stored in Slack, which can be useful for teams with limited storage space.\n  ⭐️ It reduces the chances of outdated information causing confusion or misdirection within teams.\n\n🚀 Notice\n  ⭐️ Direct messages from others cannot be deleted, neither in the app nor in the native Slack interface. This is a limitation imposed by Slack.\n\n🚀 Warranty/uncertainty of functionality\n  ⭐️ Message Deleter for Slack 3.0 relies on third-party functionalities, so feature consistency cannot be guaranteed indefinitely. Features might be added or discontinued, and in rare cases, there's a possibility that all features could stop working.\n\nCompletely free and with no ads\n\nMade with ❤️ by Peta Sittek"
