Have you ever started a watch party only to discover too late that somebody in your party doesn't have the subscription service you're using? Cookie Serial exists to solve these kinds of problems.\nWebsites use what's called a session cookie to determine if a user is logged in. Cookie Serial makes it easy to see what cookies a website has stored on your browser and (at your discretion) share them with your trusted friends. Sharing session cookies can pose a serious security threat, so Cookie Serial offers the ability to secure your serialized cookies with AES-256 encryption. Never share your session information publicly. We must always remember that the information websites store on our browsers *belongs to us* and we have the right to use that data how we like.  Share your logins.\n\nCookie Serial will never collect or sell your data."
