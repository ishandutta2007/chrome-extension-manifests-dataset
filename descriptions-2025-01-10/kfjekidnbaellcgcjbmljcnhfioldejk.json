At the top of the screen, a UFO swiftly flies back and forth, while your shooter at the bottom is ready to launch balls at it. With only 10 balls at your disposal, your goal is to take down the UFO by aiming and firing at just the right angle.\n\nHow to Play:\n1) Move your mouse left or right to adjust the shooter's angle.\n2) Launch balls upwards to hit the UFO as it moves across the screen.\n3) If your shot hits, the UFO collapses, earning you points and an extra ball.\n4) If you miss, you can keep trying until you run out of balls.\n\nStrategy:\n- Perfect the timing and angle of your shots by observing the UFO's speed and movement pattern.\n- Use each ball wisely to maximize your score, as missed shots can quickly deplete your limited supply.\n\nRack up your highest score and aim to beat your personal best, displayed at the top right corner! Additionally, after the game ends, we showcase our featured products and more, providing you with extra fun options!"
