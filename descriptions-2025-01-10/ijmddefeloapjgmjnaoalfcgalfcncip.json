That's it. It doesn't have additional bells and whistles like calendar integration, nor will it ever.\n\nHearth shows you your homepage by overriding the newtab page, and showing you your custom homepage from Hearth instead of the default newtab page.\n\nContrary to Chrome's default newtab page, Hearth supports a nearly unlimited number of links, through the use of an expanding area for icons, as well as folders to organize your homepage.\n\nThe icon for a site is automatically selected to be the favicon for that website, making the organizational process much more hassle-free.\n\nAdditionally, Hearth has an (optional) clock at the top, which helps fill empty space while still remaining clean.\n\nIcons used in this project were made by Freepik (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) available on Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/)\nDefault background by Albulena Panduri."
