It synchronizes the cookies that are set on www.googletagmanager.com to your desired domains. Additionally there is a function that only synchronizes cookies from certain GTM containers to defined domains, so that no GTM cookies are leaked to wrong domains.\n\nAnd what is the point of all this? This plugin allows the trouble-free use of the preview mode in the Google Tag Manager, if you have activated the proxy on your website. Since the gtm.js is no longer obtained directly from Google, GTM unfortunately cannot determine whether you have activated the preview mode through cookies. This plugin works around this problem.\n\nÂ©2018 Google LLC All rights reserved. Google Tag Manager is a trademark of Google LLC. This chrome extension does not stand in association with Google LLC."
