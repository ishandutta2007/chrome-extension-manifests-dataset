Harness the power of AI to determine if content on your screen was created with an AI writing tool such as ChatGPT.\n\n\nUsage Instructions:\n\nInstall Chrome Extension\nCopy the text you want to verify for AI generation and either:\nRight Click and select “Scan with DetectGPT”\nCopy the text and paste it into the manual check area in the extension and click “Check Content”\n\nAlternatively, for a page scan:\n\nVisit the page you would like to examine\nOpen the extension\nClick refresh and view results\n\n⚡️ Quickly and easily check for AI written content on a page:\nUpon visiting a website, just open up the extension and it will automatically scan the page and provide you with a result, this makes scanning for AI anywhere online a breeze.\n\n✨ No account needed:\nThere is no account or signup required, so you can install the extension and start scanning straight away!\n\nAI Trained on Popular NLP Models:\nDetectGPT AI is trained to identify content generated by widely used NLP models in popular AI writing tools.\n\nIt has been proven accurate for the following NLP models:\n\nChatGPT\nGPT-3.5\nGPT-3\nGPT-J\nGPT-NEO\nGPT-2\n\n\nSome Limitations\nThe detection of AI-generated content is not 100% accurate and may produce some false positives. With 94% accuracy on GPT-3 raw output, it will not always detect AI-generated content. However, over a large enough sample, the results can be trusted.\n\nSafeguard Your Search Rankings for the Future\nGoogle has explicitly stated that it does not want to rank AI-generated spam and has shared that it can detect such content.\n\nIt is widely anticipated that Google will take or has already taken measures to prevent AI-generated spam content from inundating search results with inaccurate information.\n\n6 Ways to Recognize AI-Generated Content when not using an AI detector:\n\nNo inconsistencies in grammar and syntax: Modern AI-generated content is typically error-free, while human-generated content is more likely to contain grammatical inconsistencies.\nAbsence of tone and style: AI-generated content might lack the nuances, personality, and style characteristic of human-written content.\nUnusual or repetitive word choice: AI-generated content may employ uncommon or repetitive words or phrases that do not naturally fit with the rest of the content.\nRepetitive structure: AI-generated content might have a repetitive structure or lack the variety and flow found in human-written content.\nLack of context: AI-generated content may not have context or relevance to the topic or audience. Timely context or references are good indicators that content was not AI-produced.\nFactual errors: AI-generated content can be identified when it contains factual mistakes. Since AI writing tools might lack context, they may include factually inaccurate information, which can be helpful in determining if the content was generated by AI."
