It's insufferably slow and crashes constantly. After only a few minutes of using GHL, the memory footprint balloons up into the gigabytes. You must constantly clear your browser cache to keep GHL even semi-usable. But, clearing your cache is a nuisance because to do it properly, you have to dig through your browser's settings and you get logged out of everything. This extension saves you from some of that trouble. With a single click of the extension icon, your GHL cache—and only your GHL cache—will be cleared, your current GHL tabs will be closed, and a single GHL tab will be reopened and ready for a fresh start. All your other web sessions will be maintained; you will not be logged out of your other dashboards and will only need to log back into GHL."
