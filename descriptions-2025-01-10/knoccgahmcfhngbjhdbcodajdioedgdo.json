It uses the Wayback Machine API and is a tiny and complementary subset to the mighty Wayback Machine.\n\nVandal focuses on ease-of-use and supports the following features for navigation and inspection:\n📅 Calendar View: The default navigation mode which uses the least amount of surface area with a mini calendar view. Supports a calendar input that shows archival stats and allows selection of month across the years.\n📊 Graph View: Navigation mode based on graphs of year and month.\n🧭 Navigator: Built-in browser with ◀️ ▶️ 🔄 actions.\n🎮 Navigation Panel: A bottom panel with navigation buttons to zip through archived snapshots for a date or across the month.\n🕛 History Panel: Access your navigation history for a website.\n🔩 Resource Drawer: A drawer that you can toggle to view timestamp differences of archived resources such as images, scripts, etc. relative to the page. This drawer updates automatically based on URL.\n⌛ Historical View (beta): Displays the snapshot of a website throughout the years.\n\nCheckout the website for more details.\n\nLimitations: \nIn some cases, a website may not be supported, the extension will then notify you to use wayback machine.\nMore details here: https://github.com/vegetableman/vandal#limitations\n\n***\n\nOpen source with public license (AGPLv3):\nhttps://github.com/vegetableman/vandal\n\n***"
