As website owners, we would like to shield ourselves from Plausible tracking from our own websites. While Plausible provides many ways to shield website owners, it would be convenient if we can share the list of websites we would like to shield from across all our devices.\n\nThis browser extension, Plausible Shield, does exactly this. You set a list of websites that you would like to shield from, and Plausible Shield:\n\n- automatically blocks Plausible tracking on these websites, and\n- enables your browser to sync this list via sync in Chrome, Firefox Sync, or a similar feature from another browser.\n\nIf Plausible Shield is synced for the first time to a new browser instance, you may need to restart the browser to take effects."
