This is available for a free trial period with no credit card required. If you decide that's not for you, the add-on can instead work with the free KeePass Password Safe 2 software and we offer step by step instructions for how to install and configure that to work on your Windows machine (and it can also be made to work on Mac and Linux with a bit more effort, with multiple guides existing to help in that endeavour)\n\n★ Who we are\n\nKee has been the most highly rated Mozilla Firefox password management extension for nearly 10 years! We have recently changed our icon to coincide with the launch of the Chrome version of the extension and the announcement of the Kee Vault password manager service.\n\nYou can look forward to even more improvements this year and join the discussion on the community forum at https://forum.kee.pm/ to let us know what features you'd most like to see developed next.\n\n★ Having trouble?\n\nIf you would like to try Kee and it is not working for you, please use the help resources at https://forum.kee.pm/t/help-and-support/24 since requests for support within review comments will remain un-noticed for a year or longer.\n\nYou should pay particular attention to the full detailed installation instructions at https://forum.kee.pm/t/installing-kee-instructions/23, the getting started tutorial at https://tutorial-addon.kee.pm/ and any advice at the top of that page.\n\n★ Permissions\n\nKee needs a variety of permissions to deliver it's functionality to you. We maintain a page that details these permissions and why we require them at https://www.kee.pm/extension-permissions/.\n\nThe built-in Chrome password manager will no longer prompt you to save passwords after you install this add-on. Any existing data will not be affected but you are strongly advised to delete any stored passwords from your Chrome password store in order to increase the security of your personal data and to avoid possible confusion in future.",
