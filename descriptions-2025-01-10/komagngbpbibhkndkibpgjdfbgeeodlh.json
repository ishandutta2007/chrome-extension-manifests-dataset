This involves a targeted click on the centre of the image, and further clicks if you wish to save the large comp to your computer. In most instances it's not possible to view this zoomed image at its full size, or easily download it for use in your designs.  \n\nThis extension adds a \"Download large comp\" link, styled as a green button, that points directly to the zoomed image. \n\nOnce activated, a green button \"Download large comp\" will be added to pages that contain a red button \"Download this photo\".\n\n* Clicking the green button will open the zoomed image in a new tab.  \n* Option-clicking the green button will download the image immediately.  \n* Right-clicking on the green button will show a contextual menu with further options.  \n\nYou do not have to be logged in to use this extension.\n\nDonations gratefully received at: http://www.gingerbeardman.com/chrome/"
