Challenges are solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget.\n\nIt is not guaranteed that challenges are always solved, the limitations of the technology need to be considered.\n\nThe continued development of selesaikan saja is made possible thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please check out https://rezaariandes.com\n\nClient app\n\nThe success rate of the extension can be improved by simulating user interactions with the help of a client app. Follow the instructions from the extension's options to download and install the client app on Windows, Linux and macOS, or get the app.\n\nSolving more than a couple of reCAPTCHA challenges a day may lead to a temporary block, regardless of your use of the extension. Visit the wiki for more details.\n\nMotivation\n\nSImple capthca challenges remain a considerable burden on the web, delaying and often blocking our access to services and information depending on our physical and cognitive abilities, our social and cultural background, and the devices or networks we connect from.\n\nThe difficulty of captchas can be so out of balance, that sometimes they seem friendlier to bots than they are to humans.\n\nThe goal of this project is to improve our experience with captchas, by giving us easy access to solutions already utilized by automated systems.\n\nRequired permissions:\n  • Read and change all your data on the websites you visit: required for accessing challenges\n  • Communicate with cooperating native applications: needed for interacting with the client app when user input simulation is enabled\n  • Display notifications: used for displaying error messages\n  • Read your browsing history: needed for resetting challenges\n\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests."
