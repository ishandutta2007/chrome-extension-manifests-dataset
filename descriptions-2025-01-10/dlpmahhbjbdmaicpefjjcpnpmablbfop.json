Extension settings will allow Users to enhance security, including session time out and device inactivity. \n\nOffline Mode for Passwords consists of three components: IT Glue Web Application, Windows Sync Service and the IT Glue Offline Mode Chrome Extension. To set up, IT Glue Administrators must first enable Offline Mode and configure the extension settings in the IT Glue web application, while signed in and connected to a Network. After an IT Glue User is granted Offline Mode access and has finished installing the Windows sync service, they can then use this Chrome browser extension to access passwords. The Windows sync service can be installed from the Account Settings page.  \n\nThe browser extension will frequently sync Passwords securely through the Windows sync service. The most recent sync will be displayed on the home screen. Passwords can be found efficiently with the extensionâ€™s search feature, allowing users to toggle between Organization and Global view. All Passwords can be viewed through this browser extension which includes Vaulted, Personal, Archived, and Timed One-Time Passwords."
