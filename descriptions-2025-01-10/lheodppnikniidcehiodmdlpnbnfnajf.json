Are they always asking you to send them pictures?  The hope is that this extension will help--if only a little :)\n\nEnter the Flickr album number that you want to pull photos from, and you will see a random picture from that collection each time you open a new tab.  This allows you to curate photos in Flickr that your loved ones will see automatically.\n\nI made this originally for my parents.  I was hosting my photos on Flickr, and even though I gave them the link to all of my pictures, they continued asking me to email them photos.  I set this up so that they get random photos that I've taken--all throughout their days.  I set up one album on Flickr dedicated to this application, and gave my folks that album number to enter in the input field.  Now, after I go on a trip I remove all the old photos in that album and fill it with new pictures from the trip.  This allows them to constantly see new photos from my life, without needing to go anywhere on the internet.\n\nI think this would be great for couples who have little kids to set up for grandma and grandpa.  For people who like to travel.  And as a nice way for people to share with loved ones what's going on in their lives--in a way that can be SEEN.\n\nOnce you enter the album number, it will remain as long as you are logged into the browser.\n\n*In short, I hope this makes a nice digital picture frame that one can come to throughout the day using Chrome.*\n\nPlease let me know of any feedback, questions, suggestions, or comments--either in the Reviews or you can email me at cmmnnighthawk[at]gmail[dot]com."
