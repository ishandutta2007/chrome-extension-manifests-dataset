Makes binge watching easier with the auto skip feature.\n\nAniskip has support websites such as Crunchyroll, 9Anime, GOGOAnime and many more.\n\nAniskip allows you to skip over anime openings and endings by adding a skip opening / ending button.

The skip times are crowdsourced and once someone submits a skip time, it will be available for everyone else who has the extension.\n\nPermissions:\n• Access your data for the supported websites and the players they support\n• Storage access to store user settings and caching for speedups\n• Authentication Information is a random user id created on install. It is used to prevent malicious use of the extension\n\nSource code can be found here: https://github.com/lexesjan/typescript-aniskip-extension. \n\nWiki can be found here: https://github.com/lexesjan/typescript-aniskip-extension/wiki.\n\nDiscord can be found here: https://discord.gg/UqT55CbrbE."
