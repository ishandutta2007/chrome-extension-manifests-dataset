You're usually curious about where it'll take you. Maybe it's a cool supplementary picture, or video. Maybe it's a wikipedia article that helps bolster some facts. If you're like me, you probably never clicked on these links. It's a hassle, and breaks you away from the flow of the article.\n\nThis extension grabs whatever's hiding in those links and displays it quickly and seamlessly on the same page of your article. Just long-click over the styled links!"
