Huge shoutout to https://exchangeratesapi.io/ for their free currency exchange API.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.8\nNew update to fix issues reported by users with the CSV Export failing in some regions. This was caused by the base64 encoding failing on some UTF-8 Characters, and has been resolved with the use of a different Base64 Library. \n\nSorry for any inconvenience.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.7\nMinor release just to restore overall functionality. We have removed currency conversion functionality due to fixer.io changing their API Rates/Plans (no longer free). Will devise a workaround to restore this functionality, but for now this will get users out of trouble.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.6\nAnother minor update to include the target currency, conversion rate and date in the EC2 CSV.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.5\nJust a minor update to let you convert costs of EC2 Instances and your Total Monthly Bill to your local currency. Let me know if you have any problems with this!\n\nUPDATE 1.0.4\nFixed a bug where the same data was displayed for each item in the CSV File. Apologies for the inconvenience.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.3\nAdded support for RDS and Reserved RDS Instances. \n\nUPDATE 1.0.2\nFixed another issue with alternate URLs - http://s3.amazonaws.com/calculator and https://s3.amazonaws.com/calculator are now accepted as URLs the button will appear on\n\nUPDATE 1.0.1\nFixed an issue where the \"Make CSV\" Button would not appear if you loaded a NON-HTTPS version of the Cost Calculator.\n\nIMPORTANT\nYou can only generate CSV Exports for the current tab that you are on - not all tabs at the same time.\n\nIf you work with AWS, you'll find yourself using the AWS Cost Calculator on a regular basis. \n\nBut, what about those times when you want to copy and paste your Cost Calculator into a Word Document, or an Excel Spreadsheet? It sure does suck doing them one-by-one, and I got annoyed with doing that manually and now you don't have to do it manually either!\n\nAWS Cost Calculator CSV Export lets you export your AWS Cost Calculator to a CSV file, which you can then manipulate into whatever you want with Excel. \n\nWant to put it into a Word document? No problem, you can do that.\nWant to put it into an Excel spreadsheet and do some fancy formulas? No problem, you can do that.\n\nAt the moment, this only works with EC2 Instances and EBS Volumes, but coming soon we'll have more options for exporting."
