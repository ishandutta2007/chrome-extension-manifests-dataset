Will be fully updated next weekend**\n\nHow to use:\n- Turn on the subtitles the way you usually would\n- Activate your browser's auto-translator by right clicking the page and choosing \"Translate to English\"(or whichever your native language is) \n\nThis is a big part of my language learning process so I figured I'd make this public since other people might find it as helpful as I do. \n\nI prefer this to be a simple extension but feel free to email me if you think there are any features I need to add. Or you can just pm me on Reddit at /u/DuhMeTreeUs"
