You can get it here:\nhttps://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N4V00000Fz2a4UAB .\n\nDESelect Search in SFMC - Salesforce Marketing Cloud is a free Chrome Extension that allows you to easily search for everything that’s traditionally hard to find in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.\n\nWhy you need this if you’re a Salesforce Marketing Cloud user?\nImagine looking for a data extension the name of which you partially know, but can’t recall which folder you saved it in.\n\nSalesforce Marketing Cloud’s search functionality is limited as it only scans one selected folder at a time. SFMC Quick Search does this for all folders at once, even if you only know part of the file name.\n\nWhat’s new?\n\n*The search bar is now completely integrated with the Marketing Cloud UI so it’s always immediately available. You can start searching and get the results in seconds.\n\n*Click links to directly go to the Data Extension you're looking for.\n\n*Another benefit is persistent results. The search results remain, even if you click or navigate somewhere else. You can use the ‘Pin’ functionality to pin your results to the top of the page, so you can navigate to your result, still maintaining full path visibility. This makes it much easier to go to that automation that’s 10 levels deep in your folder structure!\n\n*DESelect Search in SFMC - Salesforce Marketing Cloud can search for results across business units, and you can also see results from just your current business unit.\n\n*We’ve extended the search functionality so you’re now able to search objects by both name and external key.\n\nSearch for everything!\nWe currently support searching for: \n- ALL Content Builder objects: \n   - Email templates\n   - Email messages\n   - Content blocks: dynamic content, buttons, code snippets, enhanced dynamic content, freeform content, external content, html, images, image carousels, layouts, social follows, social shares, text:\n   - Mobile app push notifications & mobile messages \n- Automations\n- Data extensions\n- Query activities \n- Classic emails\n- Classic email templates\n- Data filters…\n\n----------------------------\n\nAll info regarding the security of this chrome extension can be found at: https://support.deselect.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004352797.\n\nYou can download the version of DESelect Search for Salesforce Marketing Cloud from AppExchange, using this link: https://sforce.co/3xafuqk"
