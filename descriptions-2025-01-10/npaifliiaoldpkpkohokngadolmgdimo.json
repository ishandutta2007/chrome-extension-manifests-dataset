The following functions has been implemented: a system for managing “grades” in the form of argodollars, a children’s credit score system, which depends on various parameters such as academic performance, attendance, tests etc. Also a system for scheduling makeup classes is being developed (it will analyze the child’s level of knowledge in order to determine suitable groups for a makeup).\n\nNew features in this release:\n- Fixed a bug with student info popping up in wrong places\n- Now you can submit personal and family tests at the same time\n- Added reason for argodollars\n- Added credit score breakdown\n- Added history of last operations with argodollars and tests\n- Added loading animations"
