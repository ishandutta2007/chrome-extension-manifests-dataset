For example--when you search something on google, what links did you open? Today, there isn't a great way to answer this question; you'd have to perform the search again and check what links have already been clicked. Well, not any more! Egghead keeps track of relationships between pages you visit on the internet and offers you a powerful search engine to help you find exactly what you're looking for.\n\nAll of the data this extension collects and uses exists only in your browser, and we do not collect or transmit your data to ourselves or third parties for any purpose."
