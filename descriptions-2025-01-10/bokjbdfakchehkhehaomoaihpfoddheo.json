Those days are over. Slipstream allows you to export your completed flight pairings from CrewTrac and download them as a CSV (comma-separated values) file, which can then be imported into any digital logbook software such as LogTen Pro, Logbook Pro, ZuluLog, and others.\n\n‚ú± How Does It Work?\n\n1. Navigate to CrewTrac's \"Pairing Inquire\" page for any completed pairing.\n2. Click the \"Export\" button to download that pairing as a CSV file.\n3. Import the CSV file into your preferred digital logbook.\n4. Grab a cocktail üç∏ and relax.\n\n‚ú± Getting Help\n\nIf you think you've found a bug, or if you have ideas for new features, please create a new Issue on this project's GitHub page at: https://github.com/bws428/slipstream/issues.\n\n‚ú± Supported Airlines\n\nSlipstream currently only works with Spirit Airlines' CrewTrac website. Other airlines may be supported in the future. If you're interested in testing Slipstream at your airline, please contact the developer."
