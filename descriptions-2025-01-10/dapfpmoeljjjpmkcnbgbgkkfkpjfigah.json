With that feature turned on, Pink Thumb will send signals to your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint instance.\n\nSee the following blogpost for more information:\n\nhttps://emptydc.com/2022/12/05/pink-thumb-2023\n\nWith Pink Thumb you will be able to distinguish between for example:\n\naccounts.googie.com \n\nand\n\naccounts.google.com\n\nIf you click on the first link in a phishing email, you might not recognize that this is not the Google login page, but a phishing site. Pink Thumb will warn you in such scenarios.\n\nConfigure the JSON with all the important website (Banking, Facebook, etc.) that you are providing secrets to regularly so that you know, something strange is going on, when you think you are logging into a known page and Pink Thumb displays an alert icon.\n\nType secrets only if you see the pink thumb!\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @jangeisbauer"
