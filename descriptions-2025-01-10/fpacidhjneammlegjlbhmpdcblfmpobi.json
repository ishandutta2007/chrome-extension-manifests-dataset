Save and manage your digital assets effortlessly with our Chrome extension and web app. Create infinite Spaces to categorize and store your assets in the cloud, making them accessible from any device with a browser.  \n\nCheck out the companion app: https://arkives.vercel.app/\n\n‚úÖ Save images directly from your browser to Spaces with the Chrome extension\n‚úÖ Drag and drop images from your computer into the infinite canvas\n‚úÖ Create Post-Its to add notes within your Spaces\n‚úÖ Access your digital assets from any device with a browser\n\nüöÄ The vision: \nArkives aims to support all file types beyond images- like PDF documents, movies, ZIP files, and more, so you can save everything directly to your Spaces without ever needing to download to your local computer. Eventually, this extension will let you connect to your cloud storage service (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.) so that you can upload files directly from your storage provider to any website, eliminating the need to ever download to your desktop.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha limitations:\nüî® Currently, only images can be saved with the Chrome extension\nüî® Only images and Post-It notes can be stored and modified within the \"Spaces\"\n\nüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About the team:\nMy name is Tony and as someone who uses a MacBook for work and a PC for personal use, it's always been frustrating managing my files between two computers. There are cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox but they've never really replaced the need for downloading files to my desktop. If anything, I always ended up with many duplicates of multiple files üòÖ.  I want to build something that saves all of my digital assets to the cloud and lets me upload directly from the cloud to any service whenever I need.\n\nüëÄ Follow us: \nThere will be bugs and feedback is always welcome so please don't hesitate to reach out on the socials!  Join the community to stay up to date with the roadmap:\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/UQZjqA7EqY\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkives/ \n\nDownload the Chrome extension and join me on this journey to change the way we manage our digital assets!"
