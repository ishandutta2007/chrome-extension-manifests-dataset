This widget area can compress 20 or more fields in just a small area, showing the data you need to get your job done faster.\n\nLinks, amounts, numbers, and text can all be shown in the widget area.\n\nSetup is quick and easy. Once the plugin is installed, go to any Hubspot record page (such as a Company, Contact, Deal, or Ticket) and click on the \"Hubspot on Steroids\" icon to configure that type of page.\n\nPricing: Free for up to 5 users per Company/Hubspot Org. For your 6th User or higher, a subscription is required after the free trial period."
