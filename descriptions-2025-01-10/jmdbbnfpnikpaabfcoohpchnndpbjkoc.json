Each line represents one player and must be formatted as follows:\n\n\"Player01: usr_player01-user-id\"\n\nThe statusbar will show the name you defined (Player01) and the status according to the Users ID. You can get a players User-ID by visiting his profile on vrchat.com and copy the last segment of the URL (starting with \"usr_\")."
