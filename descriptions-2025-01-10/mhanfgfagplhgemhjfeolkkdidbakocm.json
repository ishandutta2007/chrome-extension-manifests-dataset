Re-built from the original popular LeetHub extension, it improves and expands upon the original, now featuring support for the new Leetcode UI. \n\nWhy LeetHub?\n1. Recruiters *want* to see your contributions to the Open Source community, be it through side projects, solving algorithms/data-structures, or contributing to existing OS projects. \nAs of now, GitHub is developers' #1 portfolio. LeetHub just makes it much easier (autonomous) to keep track of progress and contributions on the largest network of engineering community, GitHub.\n2. There's no easy way of accessing your leetcode problems in one place! \nMoreover, pushing code manually to GitHub from Leetcode is very time consuming. So, why not just automate it entirely without spending a SINGLE additional second on it?\n3. Completely secure! The extension runs entirely on your device and only makes 3rd-party API calls to GitHub for authentication.\n\nHow does LeetHub work?\nAfter installing the extension and launching LeetHub, it's as simple as:\n1. Click on \"authorize with GitHub\" button to automatically set up your account with LeetHub.\n2. Setup an existing/new repository with LeetHub (private by default) by clicking \"Get Started\" button.\n3. And that's it ðŸŽ‰ ...begin Leetcoding! To view your progress, simply click on the LeetHub icon!\n\nBONUS: Star LeetHub v2 on GitHub for further development of features @ https://github.com/arunbhardwaj/LeetHub-2.0\n\nLet's see you ACE that coding interview!\n\nUPDATES:\n** Jun. 28 2024 **\n- Persistent stat tracking across LeetHub v2 installations\n\n** Jun. 2 2024 **\n- Manual submission button (beta)\n- fixes GitHub rate-limit issue with problem/topic organization README feature\n\n** May. 31 2024 **\n- adds new feature organizing problems via their topics in repo README\n\n** May. 30 2024 **\n- fixes issue where submission sometimes does not upload to GitHub\n- fixes upload progress spinner not appearing\n- fixes issue with submissions not going through on study plan pages\n\n** Apr. 3 2024 **\n- restores submission functionality \n\n** Jul. 24 2023**\n- fixes an issue preventing submission to GitHub for LeetCode submissions due to UI change\n\n** Apr. 14 2023 **\n- adds Leetcode UI v2 support"
