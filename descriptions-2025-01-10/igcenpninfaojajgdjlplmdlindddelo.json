Quickly find out your qibla direction line between your location and Kaaba. At the same time you will be able to visually know the qibla compass degree.\n\nWith this extension, the Qibla direction line of your location is created. The Qibla Compass extension automatically generates your Qibla direction line by getting the latitude and longitude of your location from the browser. You can find your Qibla direction by looking at the houses or streets around your location. This is how you can easily learn the qibla direction, which is a requirement for prayer."
