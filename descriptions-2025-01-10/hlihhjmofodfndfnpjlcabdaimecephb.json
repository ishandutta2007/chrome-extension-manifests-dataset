Make text darker so you can read websites and email the way you want to.\n\n** THIS EXTENSION HAS A 14 DAY FREE TRIAL AND REQUIRES A SUBSCRIPTION PURCHASE **\n\nThis extension works with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Brave.\n\nNo more grey text.\n\nAre you sick of sites that put grey text against white backgrounds? You're not going blind, you're just suffering from a terrible design trend. You don't need to highlight text just to read it anymore. Change text to black with this extension.\n\nNo more tiny text.\n\nSome websites look like they've been written for ants. You can zoom in on the page, but then it zooms in on all the pictures, buttons, icons and turns the page into a cluttered mess. Leave your magnifying glass behind, you can now change text size.\n\nNo more thin text.\n\nEver had to squint with your eyes two inches from the screen because of pencil thin text? All it does is give you is eye strain and headaches. You don't need to worry about this with Make Chrome Text Black. Make text bold and thicker.\n\nNo more weird fonts.\n\nHow about strange fonts that look closer to ancient symbols rather than letters? They might look cool in a web designer’s portfolio, but not when you’re trying to read them. You can now change the font to something sensible."
