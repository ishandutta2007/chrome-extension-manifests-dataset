Although the website lets you preview entire tracks, it also pauses your preview every thirty seconds. Often, thirty seconds is not enough time to get a real feel for a track, and the interrupted flow can be extremely frustrating.\n\nautobleep automatically restarts the preview for you, so you don't have to look through your million and a half tabs to find and click the play button again.\n\nUpdate - 8/3/2014 - Works with new version of Bleep.com!"
