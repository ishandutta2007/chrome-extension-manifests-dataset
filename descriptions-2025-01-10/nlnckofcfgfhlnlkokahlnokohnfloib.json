It is not a tool based on the outright environmental and social performance of fashion brands.\n\nâ€‹We hope that we can do well by empowering e-commerce consumers to support increasingly greater environmental and social disclosure from the world's leading fashion brands.\n\nGreater transparency from large fashion brands is an important precursor for greater consumer, investor and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nWith greater universal scrutiny and pressure, made possible by the greater environmental and social disclosure from brands, fashion brands' environmental and social impacts will be reduced over time.\n\nAt Proco, we intend to support reducing the fashion industry's incredible impact on the world's environment and its people."
