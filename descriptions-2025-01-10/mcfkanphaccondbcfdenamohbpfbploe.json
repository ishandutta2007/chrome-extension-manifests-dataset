Does it completely lack any sort of styling? Then Readable is for you!\n\nReadable adds the following styles to the body of a html page:\n\ncolor: #444;\npadding: 0 25%;\nline-height: 1.4em;\nfont-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;\n\nThe result: Your page is now readable!\nThe background is slightly darker and the text is slightly lighter - lower contrast means it is easier to read.\nPadding is added to put the content in the middle of the page rather than from the edges, which is horrible to look at.\nThe font is changed to Helvetica, which is a nice font.\n\nActivate Readable by clicking the icon next to the Omnibar.\n\nNote: this is not magic. Only use on sites with no CSS, it won't fix bad CSS (most of the time)"
