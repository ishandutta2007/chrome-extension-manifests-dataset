Repetitive prompts\n  - If you need to enter similar prompts frequently, for example, getting the latest news about different industries, you can enter once in the CSV file and run the automator every day without needing to type in repeatedly\n\n2. Very long response time\n  - If you know what prompts you want to enter, but tired of waiting for the response to come out before entering another prompt, you can use this tool to save time waiting.\n\n3. Very long prompts\n  - If you need to enter similar long prompts frequently, you can store your prompts in a CSV file and upload the file when you need to prompt ChatGPT.\n\nHow to use it\n1. Prepare your prompts\n  - The first column lets you categorise the prompts into different chat windows. Only the first prompt in the new window should not be empty, and you can write in any text. Other cells in that column should be empty.\n  - The second column is all the prompts you want to type into ChatGPT in order.\n\n2. Save the file\n  - The file should be saved as the .csv format\n\n3. Upload the file and start\n\nFeedback\n1. If you find the extension useful, consider leaving a review for us. It helps us improve your experience using it.\n\n2. Join the Discord community through https://www.qjlearn.com/chatgpt-automator/\n\n3. Email hi.yiqwan@gmail.com if you have any questions"
