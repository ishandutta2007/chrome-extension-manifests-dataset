But is digital tech really green?\n\nWe like to think of the internet as this weightless, immaterial thing that exists ‘up there’ - but the reality is far different. The web relies on vast server farms that consume enormous amounts of energy, not to mention the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing all of our modern gadgets.\n\nThis Chrome browser extension monitors your web activity, and calculates the resulting carbon footprint. As you surf the web, the extension tracks how long you spend viewing a page, and uses a conservative estimate of 0.2 grams of CO2 per second. This total is displayed whenever you click on the extension, and can also display individual calculations for each of the websites that you visit.\n\nThis piece is part of a larger project - USER_FRIENDLY - by Dan Cainey, which uses Post-Internet art to examine people's increasing faith in technology.\nwww.dancainey.online"
