However, it's often time-consuming and impractical to thoroughly test across all 35 currency pairs 🌍💱 and the five most popular timeframes ⏳ for each pair. This is where the Strategy Tester Extension for Multiple Pairs and Multiple Timeframes steps in!\n\n🔍 This extension is designed to scan all data across selected pairs and timeframes, providing a comprehensive overview of performance metrics 📊. Key data it includes:\n\n💰 Net Profit: Measures the total profitability of the strategy.\n\n📉 Closed Trades: Shows the number of completed trades, which helps gauge trading frequency and potential for overtrading.\n\n🏆 Win Rate: Tracks the percentage of successful trades, an important indicator of strategy reliability.\n\n⚠️ Max Drawdown: Measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in equity, helping to assess risk.\n\n📈 Profit Factor: Indicates profitability relative to risk by dividing gross profit by gross loss.\n\nWith this data, you’ll no longer miss potential opportunities to identify the most profitable pair and timeframe combinations for your strategy 🌟. The extension enables efficient scanning across multiple pairs and timeframes, helping you identify the setups that yield the best results with your strategy 💪📉💹.\n\nLet me know if you need further details or additional content on any specific aspect of the extension! 📬 \n\n- 0xTheChartist\n\nMy blog: blog.code2trade.top"
