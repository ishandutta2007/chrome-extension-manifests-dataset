However, SmellsPhishy is the first privacy-focused anti-phishing extension that protects you from phishing scams/dangerous and misleading sites without sending any of your data to the cloud. Our processing is done completely locally on your computer with an entirely innovative algorithm, making it faster and far more private than any other extension.\n\nSmellsPhishy not only gives you a reliability percentage for the site you are on, it also processes every link on the site and highlights them if they are unreliable. \n\nWith SmellsPhishy, you no longer need to sacrifice your privacy for the sake of online security. \n\n*Developed by Kian Attari and Karim Yafi of Harvard University*"
