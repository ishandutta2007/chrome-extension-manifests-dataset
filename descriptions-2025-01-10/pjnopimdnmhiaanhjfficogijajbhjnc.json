But that's not all the extension does. This project also adds further quality of life features to the twitch player and ui so that you can enjoy your favourite streams the best way possible. I am trying to add more features to the set as frequently as possible and would like to encourage you to leave your ideas in the comments or on GitHub. If you find any bugs or things that don't quite work the way you expect them to please let me know by creating a new issue on GitHub.\n\nv.1.2 aims to remove the \"purple screen\" that twitch now shows on all embedded streams instead of ads. This version also includes bug fixes and some small new features.\n\nv.1.1 of the extension lets you view ads in a mini player on the bottom left corner of the page. That way you can support your favourite streams while not being bothered to watch ads full screen.\n\nFor the full changelog visit my GitHub.\n\nYou can find the source code for this extension right here if you want to know how it works: https://github.com/LeonHeidelbach/ttv_adEraser."
