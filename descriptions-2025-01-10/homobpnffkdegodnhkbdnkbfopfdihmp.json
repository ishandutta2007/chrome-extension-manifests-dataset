This extension was built with the purpose of providing users with an on-screen ESTIMATE of imperial units to SI to give them a general idea of what values to expect using the provided table as reference.\nUnits are converted in a linear fashion and as such, values on the extremes of the conversion ranges will not be as accurate; this is meant to be an aid, not to give you exact calculations (currently)."
