Why are we relying on a handful of human fact-checkers to counter them?‍\n\nRight now, there are wars on 4 out of our 6 inhabited continents, the American government is in turmoil, and we’re gearing up for yet another election . \n\nAgendas are becoming more heated, and politicians more desperate. And that means we’re seeing a fake news epidemic like never before, without the proper tools to combat it.\n\nfactfully is the world’s first AI-driven misinformation checker. We use carefully trained algorithms to determine whether content on the internet is true or not, and if not, who’s behind the lie.\n\nOur algorithm first uses a neural network to rank a statement in 13 different metrics, such as sensationalism, testability, and political bias, in order to do a pre-evaluation of whether a statement seems true or not.\n\nNext, we cut out all the layers of fluff in the statement, and use a tokenization algorithm to determine which parts of the statement can be objectively fact-checked, and which parts are subjective opinions.\n\nThird, we scrape thousands of websites across the web to determine whether the statement has been corroborated by other sources or not.\n\nCurrently a Chrome Web Extension, coming to other platforms soon."
