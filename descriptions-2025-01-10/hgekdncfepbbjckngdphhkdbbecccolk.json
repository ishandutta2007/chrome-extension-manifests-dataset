If you happen to miss a lot of lectures, why not create a calendar to see all your other options in one place?\n\nThis extension finds all the lectures from other sections and turns that information into a file that you can import into your calendar. Next time you sleep in for that early morning class, just check your calendar and try attending a later section! Or even better, create your own schedule from scratch! Mix and match with the other sections until you have a schedule that fits you (and your sleeping habits).\n\nAfter installing, head on over to Quest -> Enroll. By default, your schedule will be in list view, and here you can select the lectures that you'd like to have in the calendar. When you're ready, just hit \"Download Alter Schedule\" to get your .ics file, and then import it into your calendar!"
