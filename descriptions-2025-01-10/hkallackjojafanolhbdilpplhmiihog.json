Adding infotxt to Chrome means that it will check the /.well-known/ directory for a security.txt file. If it is present, clicking on the extensions icon will present the information needed to directly contact and report security issues to that company. Security Researchers and Ethical Hackers will greatly benefit from the ease of use and user experience that this extension presents.\n\nSecuritytxt is a proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies. The security.txt file sets clear guidelines for security researchers on how to report security issues, and allows bug bounty programs to define a scope. Security.txt is the equivalent of robots.txt, but for security issues. This standard has begun industry-wide adoption by companies such as Facebook and Google. The Internet draft for security.txt can be found here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt."
