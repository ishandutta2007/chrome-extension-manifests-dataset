Say hello to Scroller, a Google Chrome extension designed to enhance your reading experience by automating the scrolling process.\n\nGetting Started:\n1. Install the Scroller extension and pin it to your browser.\n2. Click on the Scroller icon (next to the address bar) to access and save your preferred scrolling configuration.\n3. To activate Scroller, right-click on the webpage, select \"Scroller\" from the dropdown menu, and choose either \"Start Scroll\" or \"Stop Scroll.\"\n4. If enabled, a double-click anywhere on the webpage will initiate the auto-scroll feature.\n5. An option to select if the webpage should automatically scroll on the page load.\n6. A single click on the webpage will temporarily pause the auto-scroll. To resume, simply scroll manually. To permanently stop, use the right-click menu.\n\nFeatures:\n\nScroller offers two modes for a tailored scrolling experience:\n\n1. Simple Mode: Adjust the scroll speed to your liking, choosing from slow, medium, or fast. The speed is customizable, with 1 being the fastest and higher values slowing the scroll speed.\n\n2. Advanced Mode: This mode provides additional options:\n- Scroll Percent: Define the percentage of the visible screen to scroll in each interval.\n- Interval: Set the time gap (in seconds) between each scroll.\n- Scroll Till: Specify an element on the page where scrolling should stop. Use the element picker button next to the input field to select the element on the current webpage. The element you're selecting will be highlighted in light blue. (Refer to the 3rd and 4th screenshots for more details).\n\nBoth modes allow you to enable or disable the \"double click to scroll\" feature per domain and support the \"auto scroll to top\" feature. If enabled, Scroller will automatically scroll the page to the top once the scrolling is completed.\n\n\nNote:\nRemember to save your configuration before using the \"Scroll Till\" option. \nThe configuration is stored per domain (e.g., www.example.com), not per individual webpage."
