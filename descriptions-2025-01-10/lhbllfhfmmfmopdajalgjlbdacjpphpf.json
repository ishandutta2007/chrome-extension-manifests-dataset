It will create one simple overview of all prompts in the fest that you can search though, after which you can save prompts to look over them later.\n\nNo more clicking and scrolling though many pages! You will be able to narrow your prompt search down to seconds with the provided filters for:\n- Claimed/unclaimed status\n- Relationship\n- Rating\n- Text search for title, tags, prompter name (if provided) and summary\n\nInstructions\n1. Go to the \"Prompts\" page of the fest you want to browse prompts of.\n2. Open this extension again on that page and click \"Scan prompts\" above.\n3. Wait for it to finish reading prompts on all the pages.\n4. The extension can't open again automatically once it's done, so please open it again yourself to see the result (tip: enable \"Pin to toolbar\" in the settings of the extension for easy access).\n5. Now you should see all the prompts of the fest! You can use the filters for finding that one prompt that tickles your fancy without having to click through a ton of pages!"
