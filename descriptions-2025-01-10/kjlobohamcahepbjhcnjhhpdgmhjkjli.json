This leaves the Web content consumer exposed to all sorts of typographic cruelties, such as representing the ellipsis character ’…’ with three single full stops “...”, incorrect usage of a normal space where a non-breaking space would be preferred and even omission of the Oxford comma... While fighting the cause, namely sloppy Web authors, is like a fight against wind mills and certainly impossible to realize on Web scale, fighting the symptoms is a realistic option. Using client-side work-arounds, the Web can actually be fixed one page at a time. With this extension, we show how via part-of-speech tagging and JavaScript DOM event listeners, the Web can be made a better place.\n\nOn a related note, this extension has the bad ass-feature of actually implementing xkcd #37: http://xkcd.com/37/ Yeah, for real\n\nRead the accompanying scientific paper: https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B9LlSNwL2H8YbkpsV0pLQnM2bXc"
