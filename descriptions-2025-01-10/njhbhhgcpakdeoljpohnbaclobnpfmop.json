It's under heavy development and currently has little practical value as a productivity tool.\n\nThe current release is meant to act as an anchor for developers interested in the Ccc language and/or experimentation with the Chrome platform.\n\nCcc is a Scheme derivative which covers most of the R5 spec while taking some liberties with omissions and extensions.\n\nCmacs includes a built-in Ccc API for editor manipulation.
