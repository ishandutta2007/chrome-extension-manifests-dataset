It automatically updates every time your web browser opens with the latest Phishing Net Cyber Threat Intelligence.\n\nThis means that even if you don't have any security measures, or you aren't connected to your employers virtual private network (VPN) that does have security measures like firewalls and proxy servers, you will not be able to reach a website address that we have identified as malicious.  Even if you do have existing security measures, having an extra one isn't a bad thing.\n\nIn the event that you click a link that we have identified as malicious, we will not allow your browser to open that link, and we will redirect you to safety.  \n\n36 million people have been targeted by scammers so far this year (2021).  \n\nScams and malicious links come in many guises, whether it be a get-rich-quick scheme, special offer, fake security alerts or even the promise of romance. It's easy to think it'll never happen to you, but the reality is anyone can be targeted and anyone can be tricked into clicking a malicious link.\n\nWe are continuously updating our threat intelligence with the latest cyber threats, and the only thing you need to do to update it, is restart your browser.  If you turn your laptop off on an evening and then start it up again in the morning, it will automatically update itself.  Even if you don't turn off your laptop, just closing your browser and re-opening it will do the same.\n\nWe do not monitor or record your web browsing traffic either.  What we do record is every single website that we have determined as malicious.  If you click a link that takes you to a malicious website we have identified, we record that malicious link and your license key and the time it was clicked.  Nothing else.\n\nThe free download 30 day trial license will give you unlimited access to our Phishing Net Cyber Threat Intelligence for 30 days.  If you'd like to purchase a license key to use it continuously, you can either purchase a license for £1 for 1 month, or £10 for 1 year.  That's cheaper than one fancy juice, tea or coffee a month.\n\nIt also means you'll be protected from malicious links 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, for as little as £0.03 per day.   \n\nYou don't need to download the trial license to see it in action.  If you simply install the Phishing Net extension, enable it, restart your browser and then attempt to visit \"suspiciouswebsites.com\" (we registered that website), you will see the Phishing Net in action and you will be redirected to safety.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the extension, there is nothing you need to do to get it working other than adding a license key, when you download the trial license or purchase one.  This is all done via the \"Options\" page within the extension.\n\nInstalling our extension has no impact on your browsers performance at all.  Phishing Net is extremely lightweight, but also extremely powerful.\n\nWe update our threat intelligence daily, but we will also happily investigate any suspicious links that you receive.  If it is identified as malicious, we add this to our threat intelligence, and every single end user of Phishing Net will benefit from being protected from those links.\n\nFinally one little note from our developers:\n\n\"Scammers and hackers have the ability to send millions of malicious links out to unsuspecting users attempting to infect or compromise people and their computers for malicious purposes.  So we created Phishing Net to protect every single user from all of the known malicious links scammers and hackers use, to beat them at their own game!\"\n\nRemember, if in doubt, don't click it.  Send it to us instead."
