Anyone interested in forking this can retrieve the code from the following URL:\n* http://91dave.com/trello-points-combined.zip\n\n== ABOUT ==\nBased on the two preceding Chrome Extensions (the developers of which deserve most of the credit anyway!):\n* Scrum for Trello - http://github.com/Q42/TrelloScrum\n* Points for Trello - https://github.com/jgraglia/Trello-Points\n\n'Points was a fork of 'Scrum, and 'Combined is basically a re-implementation\nof the same idea, re-using snippets of code and resources from the originals.\n\nThe aims of Points for Trello - Combined can be summarised as:\n\t* Track several types of points. Currently supports\n\t\t* (estimate) points in Dark Blue\n\t\t* [dev time] points in Light Blue\n\t\t* [qa time] points in Green\n\t* Ability to add features as I need them\n\t* Lighter memory footprint\n\t* Increased reliablity\n\n== VERSION HISTORY ==\n0.1 - 0.50: Incarnations as TrelloScrum or Trello points\n0.60:   * Created as Points for Trello -  Combined\n\t\t* Added ability to add Green 'QA' points with {2} etc\n0.61:   * Fix bug with changing badges\n0.62:   * Ability to add Red 'tags' with =tag= etc\n0.63:   * Removing the last value in a list now removes the lists total\n0.64:   * Display board totals in board header\n0.65:   * Fix rounding error on totals\n0.66:   * Add border-radius back in (given that Trello's CSS now doesn't include it)\n0.70:   * Fix several things to do with Trello's re-branding\n0.71:   * Remove background app element (still have old files yet to be removed)\n0.72:   * Make sure that badges re-render in the correct order\n\n== KNOWN BUGS ==\nBehaviour when deleting a =tag= or [{(point)}] can be a little inconsistent,\nranging from badges staying, to all badges disappearing.\n\nSometimes when a notification badge is removed, all point badges disappear.\n\nWhen other badges are added (e.g. new attachment, someone joins the card), the\npoints badges will disappear until the next refresh cycle.\n\nAll of the above tend to be fixed by refreshing the entire page\n\n== ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ==\nThe vast majority of credit for this extension must go to the developers of\nthe original extensions. I've simply re-written/extended their work to my\nown ends! (More accurately, this is a fork of Trello-Points).\n\n== License ==\nApache License 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\nIn accordance of the license above, I give due notice that ANY and ALL files\ncontained herein are liable to have been changed.\n\n\nI'm also nothing to do with Trello or Fog Creek Software. Although it has to\nbe said, owner Joel Spolsky (http://twitter.com/spolsky) is worth a follow.\n\t\t\n== AUTHOR ==\nDeveloper: @91dave (http://twitter.com/91dave)"
