It was developed to make it easier to add the above proxy to URLs such as http://www.nature.com/.. or http://dx.doi.org/.. to become http://www.nature.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/.. or http://dx.doi.org.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/..\n\nOnce the code has run, the browser redirects to the Open University website where you can log in - if not already logged in - and then it will attempt to find the journal article via the OU Library."
