Our flagship, Quick Search, product enables enterprises to build a menu of dynamic custom searches saving their teams time, driving SOP and best practice adherence across the org, and boosting productivity for any team performing regular browser based lookups. Our users report estimated time savings of 30-60 mins per day across a variety of teams ranging from support, sales, engineering, operations, and more. Any leaders managing at scale can recognize that if let's say 100 people are saving 30 minutes per day through a more efficient process, that adds up to major savings for enterprises across an entire year. To use Context Menu Search, simply highlight an account number, error code, or any other line of text relevant for your use case, then right click and select the search to pass this line of text into. With our Quick Search product, the highlighted line of text will be dynamically passed into your configured search URL selected from the menu and the new tab will be launched automatically. Your admins can also configure bundled searches and groups to guide agents toward troubleshooting best practices and guarantee all relevant KBs, documentation, and resources are checked before escalation. Context Menu Enterprise is simply not optional for enterprises looking to provide the best experience to customers. Check the Coming Soon tab for more new features on the way including AI integration with a saved prompt menu, \"Note Clipper\" which will automatically copy highlighted text and media into your note document, and \"Approved Verbiage\" which provides a menu of text snippets for common and standardized customer communication."
