Words will be translated bite-sized on websites, enabling you to refresh and expand your Luxembourgish vocabulary.\n\n-> Is LëtzRead right for me ?\n-> Privacy & User Data\n-> Things to Keep in Mind [Beta]\n\n============================\n-        Is LëtzRead right for me ?     -\n============================\n- You have started Learning Luxembourgish\n- You have a Basic Understanding of Reading & Pronunciation\n- You would like to Refresh and Expand your Vocabulary\nYou're a total beginner? Sorry, LëtzRead is not for you (yet!). Better start off with a textbook and come back later (it won't be fun otherwise).\n \n============================\n-           Privacy & User Data             -\n============================\nTo be able to translate words from websites, the LëtzRead extension requires access to website data. However, Zero (0) user data is collected and all translation processing is done locally, without leaving your device.\n\n============================\n-    Things to Keep in Mind [Beta]   -\n============================\nLanguage is a complex area in which even the best automatic translation software sometimes errs. LëtzRead overall accuracy is high enough to be useful for vocabulary training, but expect that there will be occasional words that don't fit, especially when a translation depends on specific context.\n\n✓ GOOD FIT\n-> General Web Browsing / Spare Time\nE.g. Reading News, Trivial Browsing, Wikipedia entries, etc.\n\nx BAD FIT\n-> Work / Specialized Activity\nYou shouldn't use it on content that's very specific (e.g. scientific, legal, technical texts) as translations in these areas often depend on exact context.\n\n============================\n-                        Website                    -\n============================\nhttps://www.LetzRead.com"
