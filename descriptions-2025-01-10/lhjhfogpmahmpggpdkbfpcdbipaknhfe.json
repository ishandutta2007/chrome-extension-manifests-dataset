It also locates tabs with your meeting, email, etc, when you have multiple browser windows/tabs open.\n\nTo use the extension, simply install it from the Web Store and join your meeting. \n\nZOOM IN-OUT: Once you are on the call, use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the shared content. You can also move the image around by dragging it with your mouse. Press the mouse wheel once to reset zoom and the image position to default - 100%.  Sometimes a regular double click is required (depending on the mouse brand).\n\n2. LOCATE TAB: Click on the \"Google Meet Zoom In Zoom Out\" add-on icon and use the search bar to find your desired tab by website title or URL.\n\nThis extension is a free and easy way to get a closer look at shared content in Google Meet and locate lost tabs. It is a great tool for students, teachers, businesses, and anyone else who uses Google Meet for video conferencing."
