If you're an avid player and frequently find yourself searching for cards, MTG Quick Search can save minutes of otherwise wasted time. With a minimal, yet elegant interface, you're only a few keystrokes away from the card you're looking for.\n\nThis extension requires an internet connection for card images and Google Fonts. With no connection, the extension will not function or display correctly.\n\nMTG Quick Search is now open source!\nhttps://github.com/austin0crutchfield/MTG-Quick-Search\n\nIf you enjoy this extension, please remember to rate it five stars!"
