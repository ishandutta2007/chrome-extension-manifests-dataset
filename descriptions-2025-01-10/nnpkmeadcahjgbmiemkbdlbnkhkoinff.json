(unless the extension was updated)\n- displays estimated reading time and percent read in the title bar. \n\nNew Features of Version 1.0.2 (iframes not supported)\n- Automation tab settings\n- Spacebar to play from selected location\n- Configurable to automatically click on [next page] when finished reading current one (requires refresh)\n* This works by getting element class name, if multiple elements have the same class name on page, this won't work.\n\nNew Features of Version 1.0.8\n- added domain specific settings\n- optimized code for even faster loading\n\nNew Features of Version 1.1.0\n-  custom shortcut keys.\n\nNew in Version 1.1.1 - 1.1.4\n- minor bug fixes\n\nNote:\nSome features may work differently inside iframes or Shadow DOM elements.\n\nHow to use:\nClick anywhere on the page for it to start reading from that point, if you'd rather push [spacebar] after selecting the text you want read, you can go into options and uncheck [click to read] then hit save. \nYou can also click the blue square on the bottom right to start reading from your selection or drag it to where you want to read from in case what you want to read is a link. Clicking on the blue square or the spacebar also toggles play/pause."
