Videos that have only been partially viewed will also be deleted from the playlist. For individual playlists the function is even not available at all.\n\n★ By means of this extension, the fully viewed videos can be deleted automatically from a playlist.\n\n★ The partially watched videos remain in the playlist and can be watched at a later time.\n\nThe extension extends the action menu by the entry \"Remove completely watched videos\".\n\n\"A playlist on YouTube employs a lazy loading technique, meaning that it loads content as needed rather than all at once. Therefore, this extension operates based on the entries that have already been loaded. It doesn't automatically load all entries in the playlist. For the extension to consider more videos, you would need to manually scroll down through your playlist to load more entries.\""
