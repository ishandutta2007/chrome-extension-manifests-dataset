In today's web world, sites can be a tornado of distractions such as banners, videos, sidebars, popups and other elements with the hopes of grabbing (and holding!) your attention. Usually this is a good thing because it helps us navigate websites quickly, but sometimes it can get in the way of the content we are actually interested in. \n\nGreat for long reads to prevent your eyes from jumping around the page and on websites that take your focus away from where you want it to be.\n\nThe Focus Window will follow your cursor and still allows interaction with items on the web page. The Focus Window was made to help users with ADHD improve their focus and attention but is available to all productivity buffs, life-hackers, and efficiency nerds that want one more tool in their belt to make the most of their time on the web"
