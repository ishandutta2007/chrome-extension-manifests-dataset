Knowing who to trust with your private browsing data can be confusing. With Privacy Monitor by Osano, it's easy! Just install the Google Chrome browser privacy plugin, and receive trust score alerts as you surf the web. It's like anti-virus for data privacy.\n\nHave you ever checked the box on a web site that says \"I have read and agreed to the terms and conditions and privacy policy\" but didn't actually read it? If you're like most people, the answer is yes.\n\nMost websites tell you exactly who they will be selling your private data to, who they will be sharing it with, and how they will be tracking you across the Internet as you surf; but they hide that information inside of long, complicated legal documents. Somehow this is legal. Companies such as Facebook take advantage of this loophole, but no more: It's time to take back your Internet!\n\nPrivacy Monitor by Osano uses no cookies, no tracking, no logging, and is completely ad-free. We believe that the Internet should remain safe and free. There is no catch. We care about keeping the Internet safe, and we care about you!\n\nConcerned about safety? Privacy Monitor is open sourced! Visit the Osano GitHub repository to view the source code for the Google Chrome plugin as well as other platforms.\n\nChangelog:\n\n1.0.31 - Added the ability to disable automatic notifications through option menu\n1.0.34 - Added the ability to control the time on screen for automatic notifications\n1.0.35 - Minor bug fix for repeat notifications in certain edge cases"
