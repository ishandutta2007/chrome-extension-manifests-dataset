You have to manually press *\"Enter\"* again to skip ads. This is to adapt to changes from YouTube. ***\n\n* Other buttons such as YouTube Premium button can still be skipped with one click\n\nYoutube Ad Skip Key is an extension that provides you a shortcut key/ button to skip youtube ads. It does not block ads.\n\nThis extension simulates the process of clicking \"Skip Ads\", clicking the \"x\" button of those ads at the bottom of the Youtube player and clicking the \"No Thanks\" or \"Skip Trial\" of Youtube Premium ads.\n\nThis is for people who still want to support creators by watching ads, and sometimes don't want to skip ads right when the timer ends because some ads are interesting. It also closes those ads at the bottom and Youtube Premium ads that sometimes pop up.\n\nThe default shortcut key is 'Z'. This extension only supports typing keys such as \"A-Z\", \"0-9\", \"-=[]\\;'./\", numpad keys, spacebar and enter key.\n\n*The keys are based from QWERTY keyboard layout. However, it is based on the location not the value of the key itself. For example, users can press key from other languages that is supposed to be in the same location as QWERTY 'Z' key, so they don't need to change keyboard language back to English to skip ads.\n*You must change tabs to the ad-playing youtube tab to be able to close the ad.\n*You should avoid assigning shortcut to keys that are already assigned by Youtube such as A, C, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, T, W, \"0-9\", <, >, /, [, ], -, =, Numpad+, Numpad-, Numpad0-9 and Spacebar\n*If you are also using Youtube Music, you should also avoid these keys: E, G, H, Q, R, ;\n*It does not support combination of ALT, CTRL, SHIFT + supported keys."
