I am constantly typing with my caps on and don't become aware of it until I have finished typing. Very frustrating. My thought was: what if I created an extension that gave an audible warning when more than three caps are typed in a row, alerting you to look up at the screen? My new extension integrates wonderfully with both Firefox and Chrome browsers. My goal was to assist the visually impaired and the elderly who want to stay involved and current with social media, news and work. But even the best typist can forget their caps are on. Get CapAlert before having to type that whole paragraph again!\n\nThank you,\nZodiak Paredes"
