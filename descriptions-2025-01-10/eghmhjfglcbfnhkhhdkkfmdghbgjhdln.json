You can personalize these backgrounds by choosing one or several colors from a color map. Moreover, you have eight distinct image styles to pick from. Simply select your preferred colors and style, and experience a fresh background each time you open a tab.\n\nMain Features:\n\n1) Choose Your Colors: Click extension icon to open the popup window about setting. After clicking on a color on the color map, the current tab will be changed to that color in the background. If you choose more than one color, each new tab will show the background in each of your selected colors, one after another. \n\n2) Choose Styles: In the same window, select the style you prefer from a dropdown list, and the background will change to that style.\n\n3) Keep or Change Backgrounds: On the current tab page, click the lock icon at the top right to either keep your background the same or change it every time you open a new tab.\n\n4) Switch Backgrounds Easily: On the current tab page, use the rotate icon at the bottom right to quickly switch backgrounds. When you find one you really like, you can lock it.\n\nEnjoy a fun browsing experience with this extension, making every new tab open to a beautiful color background. Additionally, we've included a \"more\" link on the settings page, just in case you're interested in exploring additional color tools.\n\nCHANGELOG\n==========\nVersion 0.1.6\n- Update image cdn links\n- Update priority in display\n\nVersion 0.1.2- 0.1.5\n- Change background image links\n- Update extension title and description\n- Change the link to more tools\n\nVersion 0.1.0 - 0.1.1\n- Initial release of extension\n- Update related icon & link"
