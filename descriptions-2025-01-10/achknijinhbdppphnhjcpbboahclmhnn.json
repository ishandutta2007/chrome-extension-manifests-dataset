It does this by simply creating a new google calendar calendar called \"UBC Courses\" and adds your classes that it can to it. Once you install the extension, it'll require permission for your google account, specifically calendar. I'm not fully verified so some browsers may warn you. There is no malicious code in my program. You can view my full project code here:\nhttps://github.com/KalaimaranB/ubc-to-workday-extension\nGrant access to the extension enable it properly. You may need to close the extension and re-open after granting permission for it to work properly. In workday go through the following steps to download the excel file showing your classes:\n1. Click on \"Academics\"\n2. Select \"Registration and Courses\" in the nav bar\n3. Under \"Registration\" click \"View my Courses\"\n4. In the top right corner above the table there should be multiple icons. The icon on the far left of them is the one to download an excel file. This is the file to use. \n5. Once you open the extension, select this downloaded file from the menu.\n6. Click Sync courses. \n7. If the quotes are coming up, it's probably working. It can take up to 30 seconds to complete (after giving the extension permissions), normally. Taking longer probably means something is wrong. \n8. Go to calendar.google.com to view your courses, now under a sub-calendar called UBC Courses. \nHeads up: Workday is pretty stupid. Consequently some classes don't have the time slot downloaded into the excel sheet. Some classes don't have their location in the excel. Why? The extension will try its best to upload the classes, but it might not work always. \nIt doesn't add classes typically for Winter break and the the \"reading week\" we get. However, this is again dependent on whether Workday gives a nice excel file. Most times it will. One bug is that the first day typically has extra classes added for some reason. I'm not sure why, but if anyone can find the error in the github code posted, that would be amazing. Otherwise it should work fine for the rest of your classes. \n\n(Credits to ChatGPT for actually writing the code for this extension and making it work somehow, cus I haven't written Javascript in years)"
