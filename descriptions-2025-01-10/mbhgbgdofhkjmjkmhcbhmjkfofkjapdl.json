By default when redirecting to AAD, Citrix add prompt=login to the URL which forces the user to re-authenticate and breaks the seamless single sign on experience. To overcome this Citrix documented a solution in CTX253779 however, this requires raising a support case for each customer to disable to re-authentication. This extension, when the auth page is detected for the Citrix Cloud application removes the prompt=login option from the URL and forwards the user to the AAD login portal without the option therefor allowing them if they are already authenticated to seamlessly single sign on and improve the end user experience."
