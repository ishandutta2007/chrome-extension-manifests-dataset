The environment. Healthcare. The economy. Every election cycle, vital issues populate the ballot. It's on everyday voters to raise their voices to choose representatives and policies that represent society's values. Readaction helps turn the headlines you read about these issues into actionable steps in three ways:\n\n1. The extension indicates the bias, on a spectrum from liberal to conservative, of news articles using the power of the Bipartisan Press API and machine learning. This helps determine if the news readers consume is balanced and aligns certain perspectives on issues with the political parties that represent American voters.\n\n2. The extension highlights key terminology inline for readers to focus on, helping them relate to key figures and topics that will prove vital in the upcoming election cycle.\n\n3. The extension lists measures and candidates referenced in and related to the article. This helps readers act on the knowledge they gain. Based on how they process the information they read, they can find representatives and measures related to the topic that appear on ballots in the upcoming election cycle. Candidates and measures are source from the WeVoteUSA API.\n\nTurn what you read into action with Readaction!"
