They often use their browser to react to videos, present information, play a game, etc. And if they visit a page that displays their full name, email or some other type of personal information, that information is visible to the stream and there is nothing they can do to stop it. That information can then be used to spam, dox, and harass a streamer or a user of these platforms. Platforms like Discord have a built-in 'Streamer Mode' that hides personal information on Discord. But these modes don't protect users when they are streaming their browser. Other sites or platforms could still display personal information and up until recently, there was no tool to protect users. This extension is the tool that solves these problems. With it, you can prevent your information from getting in the hands of people that shouldn't have ever had it; by preemptively removing that information from pages, before those pages are even visible.\n\nFeatures:\n- Ensures pages do not display your personal information, EVEN while and before loading.\n- Prevents changes to the pages from showing your personal information.\n- Ability to specify any string as personal information.\n- Warns users if a page is not fully supported by the extension, to prevent them from accidentally leaking their information.\n- Regex support (i.e. [0-9][0-9][0-9]\\ Street\\ Name) (Credit: u/VKNiLive)\n- and finally a whitelist\n\nKnown Issues:\n- Must be manaully updated when new unsupported sites are reported.\n- Doesn't support all sites\n- Tab title is still visible during load, leaking personal information contained in the title.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/AidanSpeakss/streamer-mode-for-firefox"
