Hovering any card name shows the card art and description.\n\nThe extension is fast. It is permissive and tries to match plurals, inexact spellings (\"ciri dash\" instead of \"Ciri: Dash\"), and even common appellation for cards (\"ADC\", \"gigni\" etc.). You can also choose on which sites the extension should run.\n\nFeature list:\n\n- Enabled on any website with a simple click. It is enabled by default on r/gwent, but can be enabled on messenger.com for example.\n- Includes all existing cards, up to date with the latest patch.\n- Recognizes abbreviations, acronyms, plurals, missing capitals, missing accents, missing punctuation, and common typos.\n- Non obstrusive. Add subtle highlights and does not break links.\n- Fast. You could enable it on any website, you would not feel it's here.\n\nAbout permissions:\n\nYou may be worried by the permissions requested by the extensions. I did my best to limit the required permissions to the minimum. You can find a detailed explanation here: https://soreine.dev/hyper-gwent/faq/#security"
