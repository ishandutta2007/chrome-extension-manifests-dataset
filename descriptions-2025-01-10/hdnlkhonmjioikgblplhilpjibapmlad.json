While you painstakingly type out the same text for the millionth time, do you wish there were a source to easily copy-paste each detail from? Hashboard can do that and much more for you.\n\n\"Hashboard\" is a simple extension to store short texts (like URLs, names, or anything else that you frequently use) for quick reference. It makes it easy for you to copy text to clipboard without leaving the current tab. You can also search, add, edit, copy, delete, reorder and download your list as a CSV file, all through an intuitive interface. \n\nAnd yes, it comes with a Dark Mode too!"
