When solving your daily Wordle, you can open the extension and click \"Compute Next Guess\" to analyze your game state and give you feedback.\n\nIt will generate two lists of words, one for words which maximize information, and one for words which are most likely to be the answer. You can use the analysis engine for your entire game of Wordle, or just one time if you get stuck!\n\nThe Wordle Helper is designed to give YOU control over your game and not to be a general purpose solver. Categories are split between information and answers to allow you to decide whether you need more information or if you want to go for the win.\n\nTry it out now!"
