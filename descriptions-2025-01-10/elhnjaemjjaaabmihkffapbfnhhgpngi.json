Optionally rePorpoised Flipper can wait while you are active in your browser and only rotate when you are inactive.\n\n** We'd like to thank Wayne Goyer for sharing some significant  and highly requested updates. The power of open source software! ** \n\nThis was created for using Google Chrome full-screen to power unattended screens like kiosks or tv displays where rotating dynamic/live web content is needed.\n\n** Originally created by Ben Hedrington **\n\n** Updated by Team Dolphin to load the next tab before navigation. **"
