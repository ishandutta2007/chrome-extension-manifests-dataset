Get tired of having to click play every time it's over which is basically every 5 minutes? Me too and I wanted to fix that. Which is more or less the inspiration behind this extension.\n\nI liked one particular song in a music video but didn't want to keep hitting replay and didn't like the minute long intro with no music. So I decided to have a look at the Chrome store for extensions that could solve my problem.\n\nI myself found that all the YouTube looping extensions I saw had esoteric or unappealing interfaces. So I decided to make my own that looked good, was intuitive and is easy to use. \n\nMy extension has a very appealing and sleek appearance that perfectly blends with YouTube's white and red theme and isn't distracting.\n\nThere's a range slider that appears under the title bar of the video. You can use the range slider to specify the beginning and end of the loop or you can use the \"Begin Loop\" and \"Clear Loop\" buttons on the video control bar.\n\nThere is also a red \"Loop Video\" button on the video control bar that automatically restarts the video when it ends.\n\nIt's a simple, attractive tool for looping your favorite parts of a YouTube video and makes your life a little bit easier."
