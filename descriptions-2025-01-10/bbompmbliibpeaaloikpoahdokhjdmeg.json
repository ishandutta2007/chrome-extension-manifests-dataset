This little tool helps you find it with a simple click in the toolbar and highlight of a line of text.\n\nWHY WOULD I DO THAT?\nThe length of a line of type impacts how readable it is. Generally, a good measure is between 45â€“80 characters per line.\n\nFOR DESIGNERS, FOR DEVELOPERS\nDesigning legible content requires a lot of attention, across the huge range of device types and screen sizes. A good measure on a desktop monitor might be 80 characters, but on smaller screens or multiple columns might be 45 characters. Although this could all go out the window depending on the colours or typeface used. So do remember to apply your own discretion, too!\n\nMeasure makes it easy to be more precise when creating for the web."
