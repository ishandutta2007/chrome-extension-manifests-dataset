It has been designed to look and behave much like the native CTRL-F tool, but extended with various useful features.\n\nWith {find+}, you can match any legal JavaScript regular expression against text in the page, use find-and-replace to replace text in the page, copy occurrences of a regex to your clipboard, store frequently used expressions, and configure the extension the way you like.\n\nAs a software developer, looking through lengthy stack traces, continuous integration build history, or large text files is something we do very regularly. The Chrome Find-in-Page tool works well in most cases, but offers very little when looking for very specific (or very general) keywords.\n\nA few notes:\n- This tool was designed and built for developers. If you're not familiar with using regular expressions, this tool is not for you.\n- This tool does not support dynamic pages. The purpose of this tool is to search for patterns in structured text, not in pages like Google Sheets or similar sites.\n- This tool will struggle with significantly large pages. In these cases, using another tool might be more appropriate."
