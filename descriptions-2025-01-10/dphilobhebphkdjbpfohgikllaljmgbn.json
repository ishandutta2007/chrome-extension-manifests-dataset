You can also easily send emails from your alias.\n\nSimpleLogin is an *open-source* email alias solution that allows you to quickly create an email alias.\n\nUse an email alias when:\n- subscribing to a newsletter\n- signing up for a new account \n- giving your email to someone you don't trust. \n\nLater on you can simply block an email alias if it's too spammy.\n\n## Why SimpleLogin?\n\nWhen you give away your personal email online, there is a good chance that your email address would end up with a spammer or leaked during a breach. You could check whether your email is leaked using website like https://haveibeenpwned.com\n\nSimpleLogin could also help manage your business emails. If you own a domain and don't want to pay a full solution like GSuite, you could add the domain into SimpleLogin and create emails like contact@my-domain.com, partner@my-domain.com with aliases. All our business emails (the @simplelogin.io) are actually aliases.\n\n## What distinguishes SimpleLogin\n- Generous free plan: there's no cap on bandwidth or number of replies/sends. The Free Plan is enough for protecting your personal email. Premium Plan targets at more \"advanced\" users with features like custom domain, unlimited alias, PGP, directories, etc.\n\n- Fully open source: both SimpleLogin server and client code (browser extension, JS library) are open source so anyone can freely inspect and (hopefully) improve the code. You would not trust a blackbox to handle your emails, do you?\n\n- No ads, no tracker.\n\n- The only email forwarding solution that can be self hosted, i.e. you can run SimpleLogin on your server. \n\n- Not just email alias: we are working on providing a similar technology for phone number and credit cards. Stay tuned!\n\n- Easily export your data: allows you to change the service provider if someday you decide to leave SimpleLogin."
