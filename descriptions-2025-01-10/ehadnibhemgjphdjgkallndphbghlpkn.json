To Settings and Home probably\n  * [x] Make a New Tab for bookmarks\n  * [x] Add a setting to choose the tab that would be opened by default when the popup renders (Home/Settings/Bookmarks)\n* [x] Clean up redirections. Add a message for when there's no redirections yet.\n\n2024-11-08 -> 1.21\n* [x] Change the extension icon depending on the env: \n  * grey for when the extension hasn't yet executed all code or doesn't have the permission to do so;\n  * green indicates that the Launch env is production;\n  * yellow indicates that the Launch env is dev or staging;\n  * red indicates that the Launch library is not loaded or loaded incompletely. Basically, _satellite?.environment?.stage is falsy. The rest of the functionality won't be stopped by this, however.\n* [x] Update the extension icon.\n* [x] Disable Launch UI improvements on by default.\n* [x] Multiple small bugfixes and refactories.\n\n2024-10-04 -> 1.20\n* [x] Add onInstalled/onStartup callbacks to set the default set of settings specifically for those who don't open the popup after installation.\n* [x] Support for Mozilla FF. Same extension. Cross-browsers. Seems like mostly only background will have to be reimplemented, but many APIs may be off. We'll see.\n\n2024-10-01 -> 1.10\n* [x] Appmeasurement: Prettify the product string printing.\n* [x] Appmeasurement: Add transaction id in the product string prettifier.\n* [x] Implement Launch UI improvements POC:\n  * [x] Launch UI: Add the red indicator whenever a lib is not selected.\n  * [x] Launch UI: Add a hint about how to change the Launch UI via Chrome flags.\n* [x] Add an option to print general alloy config in the snippets tab. Make sure it does so for all Alloy instances.\n\n2024-09-02 -> 1.09.1\n* [x] Rename the content-script.js to something more interesting. It's visible in the console and can be filtered by.\n* [x] Web SDK: Further improve the custom logging, allowing shorthands: p12/c12/v12/e12/l2.\n* [x] Apply all the shorthanded custom logging to Appmeasurement logging too.\n\n2024-08-26 -> 1.09.1\n* [x] Fix a bug in custom logging, in event shortcuts for the data.__adobe.analytics usecases.\n* [x] Fix a bug in custom logging, in prop shortcuts for the data.__adobe.analytics usecases.\n\n2024-08-25 -> 1.09:\n* [x] Web SDK: Expose the event type in the logging header.\n* [x] Web SDK: Improve the custom logger to also check the data.__adobe.analytics object when using shortcuts.\n* [x] Web SDK: Make it easier for non-technical people to use the custom logging: don't require them to specify the full path to evars, props or events for xdm payloads. If users ask for evars and it's an xdm event, just add the correct path to it.\n* [x] Reimplement page load time to something like performance.getEntriesByType(\"navigation\")[0]?.duration  \n\n2024-08-20 -> 1.08.1:\n* [x] Increased the delay at which the response is no longer expected to six seconds. Because AA can be very slow to respond.\n\n2024-08-18 -> 1.08:\n* [x] Web SDK: On errors, in custom logs, add an indication that the request resulted in an error. This is for people who use filters in the console like pros. Thanks Arun for noticing.\n* [x] Web SDK: MVP tracking the navigator.sendBeacon() ping network requests. No access to their payloads, however, because the Chrome devteam neglects fixing related bugs.\n* [x] Delete requests from the map on other callbacks too to avoid misreporting calls as such that didn't receive the server response.\n\n2024-08-14 -> 1.07.01:\n* [x] Increased the delay at which the response is no longer expected to two seconds.\n* [x] Cleanup.\n  \n2024-08-13 -> 1.07:\n* [x] Print the extension version, getting it from the manifest.\n* [x] UX improvements, CSS fixes. \n* [x] Add a bug submission button in info.\n* [x] Web SDK: Add an option to log all fields there are, giving the user the raw object.\n* [x] Add a callback and error logging for \"cancelled\" requests. That's when the browser cancels the request. And a few other types of requests. Thanks to Arun for the suggestion.\n* [x] Web SDK: Apply the error logging logic to Web SDK tracking too\n* [x] Small popup UI improvements.\n\n2024-06-02 -> 1.06 - Byanka:\n* [x] Replace the counter of PVs and links with AA calls and WebSDK calls\n* [x] Web SDK: Improve autodebugging: indicate when linkClicks will be treated as pageviews in AA due to the web fields set.\n* [x] Web SDK: Surface the Edge config ids for every request, make them visible just like AA Report Suites. To ease the debugging of multi-destinational tracking. First 5 characters should suffice.\n* [x] Web SDK: Improve the tracking of network errors when edge network requests fail.\n* [x] Web SDK: Refactor logging. Make it less confusing. No more nested groups.\n* [x] Web SDK: Change the default logging a bit to maybe try and expand the analytics object automatically.\n* [x] Web SDK: Add a setting to remove the essentially useless xdm fields that are rarely useful to look at. On by default.\n* [x] Web SDK: Improve the logging for non-object fields.\n* [x] Web SDK: Add logging for the data.__adobe object. Off by default in settings.\n* [x] Web SDK: Reinforce the custom logging field, allow people to use the xdm. reference in the list of params.\n\n2024-03-02 -> 1.05:\n* [x] QOL Improvements for the custom web SDK logging.\n* [x] Allow the underscore in the field names.\n* [x] Small reporting improvements.\n\n2024-03-02 -> 1.04:\n* [x] Configure selective logging for the web SDK.\n\n2024-02-16 -> 1.03:\n* [x] CSS improvements of the extension popup. Thanks Chip!\n* [x] Fix a bug in the new custom logging code.\n* [x] Add a line to indicate the end of the main logging group for easier reading.\n\n2024-02-13 -> 1.02:\n* [x] Allow the user to set their own variables to be included in the header of the logging.\n* [x] Improve _satellite.setDebug(0) to work immediately rather than after a page reload.\n* [x] Small cosmetic improvements.\n\n2024-02-06 -> 1.01:\n* [x] Code refactory in the popup scripts.\n* [x] Add a feature to highlight merch events that aren't present in s.events. Why would Adobe do this? Feels like a bug.\n* [x] Merchandising variables logging improvements (\", \" delimiter instead of the pipe \"|\").\n* [x] Add reporting for s.zip, currency code, org id (mcorgid) and visitor id (mid).\n* [x] The \"Other\" reporting section is now collapsed by default due to the number of not-so-useful new dimensions added there.\n* [x] A bit more ui improvements.\n* [x] Raccoon.\n\nFor older versions, please refer to github releases here: https://github.com/cthae/Adobe-Launch-Debugger/releases"
