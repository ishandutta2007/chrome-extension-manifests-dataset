These videos don't automatically play (unlike LinkedIn's videos), it just gives you a friendly reminder to keep going and to not give up on your job hunt or whatever else you may be procrastinating on.\n\nThis extension also preserves the videos it replaces so you can restore them if you want to for some reason.\n\nSource is available here if you're interested in creating your own version (it's super easy): https://github.com/milesoberstadt/better-motivation"
