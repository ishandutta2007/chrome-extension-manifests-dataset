Once the analysis is done, a letter grade (A-F) is displayed on the icon where A is for excellent reviews with minimal deception, and F with most reviews being deceptive. Click the icon in order to open the popup window to see detailed analysis reports as well as find suggestions for potential better alternatives.   \n\nHow it works: \nOnce you visit any Amazon product page, Earl evaluates the reviews of this product to look for deceptive reviews aimed at giving a wrong image of the true quality of the product. Once the analysis is done Earl letter grades the product's reviews and provides recommendations of potentially better alternatives. \n\nEarl's goal is to protect consumers from fake reviews on Amazon and is designed to be non-invasive helping consumers make the best purchase decisions.\n\nContact:\nabdelhas@iusb.edu"
