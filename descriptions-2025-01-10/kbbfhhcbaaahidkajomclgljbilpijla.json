If you're anything like me, once you encounter a new term you don't understand in your current page, you'll middle-click it to open it up in a new tab for reading later. This results in a lot of clutter at the top of your browser and can really slow things down if you're on an older computer.\n\nMeet Qwikipedia! The quicker, more convenient way to browse Wikipedia. Anytime you encounter a blue term you'd like to know more about on a Wikipedia page, simply hover over it with your mouse to get a popup of the essential information about that item! Save time and computer resources with Qwikipedia."
