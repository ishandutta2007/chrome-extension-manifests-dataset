It's the comment section for Netflix (and more) that you always wished existed. You can start the next great conversation while your watching (and no need to hop to another site or app).\n\nAdd reactions!\n\nReact to your hearts content with the Reactline reaction bar! The reaction bar lets you quickly (with a click or a keyboard shortcut) react to what's happening (sometimes an emoji is worth a 1000 words). And did we mention that it's customizable?"
