Just go to the options page and click the checkbox to try it out. \n\nMay add options in the future for transition speed or a show/read more link. \n\nBugs may exist due to reddit's unique handling of off screen elements.\n\nIf you like my work, please consider a small one time donation.\nhttps://ko-fi.com/castordaedalus\n\nV. 22.11.10.1\nFixed logic with not being able to collapse content sometimes\nV. 22.11.9.1\nFixed oversight with clicking the text while viewing the comments page.\nV. 22.11.8.1\nSimplified the code to be what it should have been. It's more consistent now."
