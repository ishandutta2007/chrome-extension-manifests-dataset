Instantly open any transaction hash in Tenderly for granular insights in a human-readable format. Replay transaction execution, debug errors trace by trace, or run transactions in a new development environment for further testing and experimentation. \n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nHow to use Tenderly Dev Toolkit?\n\nWith Tenderly Dev Toolkit available in your browser, you can jump straight to on-chain exploration and debugging from any block explorer. You no longer need to switch context or manually copy-paste transaction hashes. In a single click, you can explore, analyze, and debug on-chain data using Tenderly’s Web3-native tools for complete observability, flexibility, and efficiency. \n\nOnce you install the extension, the toolbar gives you instant access to Tenderly’s industry-recognized dev tools and functionalities directly from any block explorer: \n\n- Simulate: Replay transactions with updated parameters, inputs, and even contract code. Preview transaction execution and see the expected outcomes without sending transactions on-chain.\n\n- Debug: Troubleshoot failed transactions with a trace-by-trace Debugger. Analyze human-readable error messages and identify the exact cause and line of an error. Then, quickly edit contract code to try out a fix directly in your browser.\n\n- View trace: Examine the entire execution of a transaction with a full stack trace and enriched transaction data. Dive into transaction opcodes, analyze gas usage, or highlight addresses with custom names and colors.  \n\n- View state changes: Go through the state changes that happened during transaction execution, including old and new values. Understand what happened at a glance by analyzing events or variables in both decoded and raw format.\n\n- View gas usage: Analyze how transactions use gas per individual function call. Get a granular breakdown of gas consumption during execution. Identify computationally intensive lines of code and optimize them to reduce gas usage.\n\n- Run on VNet: Replay transaction execution on a new Virtual TestNet, a zero-setup development environment synced with the latest mainnet state. Run further tests and experiments with an unlimited faucet, unlocked public accounts, and custom RPC methods.\n\nSpeed up your on-chain exploration and debugging across EVM chains, L2s, and rollups with powerful Tenderly tools at your fingertips. \n\nLearn more about Tenderly’s full-stack infrastructure:\n\nWebsite: https://tenderly.co/ \nDocs: https://docs.tenderly.co/ \nBlog: https://blog.tenderly.co/"
