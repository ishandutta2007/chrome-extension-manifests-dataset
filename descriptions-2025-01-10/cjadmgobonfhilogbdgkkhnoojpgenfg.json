For example, you can choose, pop, club, party, soft rock dance, or any other preset format for the audio stream. Please note that you can also define your format and then save it for later use in the toolbar popup. There is also a - reset - button to revert all changes to the factory setting.\n\nNote: this add-on has a Mono feature. Mono is an accessibility feature for people with hearing problems (i.e. deaf in one ear). When this feature is active, you will never miss a word or sound when you are listening to audio from headphones.\n\nTo report bugs, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/audio-equalizer.html)."
