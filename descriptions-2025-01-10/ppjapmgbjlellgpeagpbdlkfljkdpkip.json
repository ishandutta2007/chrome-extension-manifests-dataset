This can be achieved through various methods like regular expressions or leveraging browser APIs to identify phone number patterns within the displayed text.\n\nClickable Link Conversion: Upon identifying a phone number, the connector dynamically transforms it into a clickable link. This typically involves manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) of the CRM web page, replacing the plain text number with an HTML anchor tag (<a>) that triggers a specific action on click.\n\nMicrosoft Teams Deep Linking: When a user clicks the converted phone number link, the connector initiates a deep link to the Microsoft Teams application. This deep link carries the phone number as a parameter, instructing the Teams client to prepare for an outgoing call.\n\nCall Confirmation and Initiation:  Microsoft Teams displays a confirmation prompt with the retrieved phone number from the CRM. The user can then review and confirm the call details before initiating the connection. Once confirmed, the Teams client utilizes its built-in calling functionality to establish the phone call."
