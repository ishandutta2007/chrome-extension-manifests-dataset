Just enter a team number, and a badge will appear showing you the current seeding position of the team in the qualification rounds. When the badge changes color to red, it means that your team has played it's next match, and clicking on the extension's icon will reveal the latest score for the team's alliance in italics, and the latest score for the opposing alliance normally. \n\nNote: This app is powered by The Blue Alliance, and as such the match results and seeding positions are not updated in real-time. The results are often subject to a delay a few minutes, although in some cases this delay may be longer."
