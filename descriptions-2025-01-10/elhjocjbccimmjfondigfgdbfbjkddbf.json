It transforms lengthy terms and conditions into clear, concise summaries, so you are informed before you agree.\n\nKey features:\n\n1) Automatically detects when you're on a \"Terms and Conditions\" or \"User Agreement\" page and pops up an icon at the bottom right.\n\n2) Click the icon to get a quick summary of the key things you should know before agreeing.\n\nYou may get a surprise or two about what’s hidden in the fine print you’ve been ignoring!\n\nWe value your feedback! Please share your thoughts, as we're continuously improving Barrister Gemini. Currently, we're working on integrating machine learning to make the detection even smarter and more accurate."
