This widget allows you to mark the website associated with the search result.\n\nThrough this UI widget, you can:\n\n1. Use the left \"*/P/N\" marker to indicate whether the website needs attention (by default, the marker is a green *, indicating that this is a new site; you can switch it to a red P to indicate that it needs attention, or a gray N to indicate that it no longer needs attention).\n\n2. Use the editable text area in the middle to record a short note about the website.\n\n3. Use the rating marker on the right to score the website according to your own standards for future categorization.\n\nFinally, you can access the summary page through the action button, where you can see all the sites that have appeared. You can filter them by time and your ratings."
