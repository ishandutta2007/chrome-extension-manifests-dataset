Therefore, by pinpointing on frequently used expressions that omit an actual source, a strongly biased point of departure is made towards interpretation and personal opinion. The aim hereby is to strengthen the awareness for media literacy in an age of post truth and to interpret information through a questioning lens.\n\nThis chrome extension makes it possible to browse the news with a highly critical approach to source verification, changing perspectives of news interpretation for us, the consumers. \n\nIf the highlighted vague source is coming from direct or indirect speech from an individual or is part of an institutional statement, the analysis of Matter of Interpretation is not valid."
