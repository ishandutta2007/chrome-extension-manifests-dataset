This extension simplifies that process with enhancing features:\n\nAuto scroll down to fully show the videos (ignoring the channel banner and stuff)\nShift+⬇️ (down arrow) to go to the next subscribed channel that has a new video\nAuto click \"Show [number] More\" under the Subscriptions section.\nPause youtube channel autoplay video if there is one\n\nI hope your life gets just that bit easier with this extension :)\n\n*Update: YouTube updated its interface, so I had to update this extension."
