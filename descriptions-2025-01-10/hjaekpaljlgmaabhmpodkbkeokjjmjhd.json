You can create tasks form the Chrome Browser and associate the current tabs you are using with the tasks.  \n\nWhen you want to work on completing the tasks, you can launch the 'chunk' of the tasks you want to work on, and the extension will create a separate window with all the associated tabs.  It's easy!\n\nHow Does This Help You?\n* Focus on related tasks at a time\n* Minimize the cons of multi-tasking\n* More clarity on what needs to get done\n* Group the resources needed to accomplish your tasks quickly\n* Gain insight on what really needs to get done by identifying urgency, difficulty, and long term importance\n* Reduce distractions"
