Do YOU feel the Danger Zone in GitHub isn't dangerous enough? Then this extension is for YOU.\n\nA mere mouseover of the \"Delete this repository\" button will trigger the immolation sequence. No more \"Please type your name to confirm I understand the consequences\" pussyfooting. You were born understanding the consequences.\n\nHead to https://github.com/YOU/respository/settings to play with fire\n\nNB: Due to Sudo mode (https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/sudo-mode) there'll actually be a final failsafe requiring your password. I could make this extension ask you for it beforehand but you should never share your password with anyone. No matter, you can still scare your friends with this ðŸ˜€"
