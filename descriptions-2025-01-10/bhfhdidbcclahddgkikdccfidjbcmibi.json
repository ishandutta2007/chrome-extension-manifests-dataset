It is so helpful, I wouldn't know what to do without it. I like how it just gets out of the way and I don't even have to think about it. I can easily send screenshots and video recordings to people on our team and to clients with ease.\" — Nicholas Scalice, Growth Marketer at Earnworthy\n\n\"Jumpshare saves me a ton of time and allows me to work on my schedule. Customers love getting detailed screencasts from me and ask for them over and over. I especially like the option for a \"call to action\" link which lets people click on a link after the video - I link to my online calendar and let customers book time with me. It's a beautiful workflow. You cannot afford to NOT use Jumpshare.” — Dave Baxter, Estate Agent, DB Realty\n\n\"Jumpshare makes it significantly easier for me to work with my web developers. Instead of trying to describe what I am seeing with the site builds, I can show them what I am seeing and there's no miscommunication or misunderstanding.
