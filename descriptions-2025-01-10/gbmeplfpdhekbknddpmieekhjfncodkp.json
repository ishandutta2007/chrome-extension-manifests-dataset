Now you can make them show their true faces! \n\nAfter installing, you can click on the crybaby icon in a user's comment and their profile picture will change to a random image of a crying baby. You can manage your crybabies by clicking on the crybaby icon in the address bar.\n\nNote: Their profile picture only changes on your browser. So, only you see them as a crybaby (perhaps this is political commentary)."
