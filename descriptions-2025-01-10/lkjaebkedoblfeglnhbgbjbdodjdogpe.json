If a page does have the necessary Open Graph metadata, the extension will display a preview of the image, title, and description. The extension will also report if the image, title, or description are missing.\n\nSocial media marketers will find the extension helpful to see how a news article, blog post, or product page will appear on social networks. If they don't like the image, title, or description, they can update the page and then use Coywolf's Open Graph Checker to preview the changes. The extension always attempts to retrieve the page's non-cached version to assist in viewing the most recent changes.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using it, and please don't hesitate to send us feedback. If enough people think this tool is useful, Coywolf will add more features to it. We are all about optimizing and making things better."
