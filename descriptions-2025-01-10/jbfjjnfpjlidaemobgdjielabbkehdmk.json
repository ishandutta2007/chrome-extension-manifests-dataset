Zen mode hides the complete sidebar, removes the promoted/sponsored product listings, and hides the discussion cards. The extension also aligns the product listing beautifully in the center of the screen for better readability. Additionally, you can also enable Dark Mode (dark mode fans anyone üòâ)\n\nFocus on the discovery üßò\nWith PH Zen on, you will find the product discovery experience on Product Hunt much more delightful and less distracting.\n\nDark Mode üï∂Ô∏è\nYou can enable or disable Dark Mode (irrespective of your master settings) just for the Product Hunt page. So, you can be on dark mode for every other website and view Product Hunt in the OG light mode. We know it's not much, but some may appreciate it.\n\nLinks üîó\nIf you are like me and prefer to avoid hovering over the title of a product to be able to visit the website. We have now made it super easy to be able to visit the website of any product launch.\n\nSettings ‚öôÔ∏è\nYou can also enable/disable each of the options individually. You can choose to show only the articles, discussions, and promotions. We ensure you get the experience that is just right for you ‚Äì customize the way you like.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments or suggestions, contact us at team@typestack.ai"
