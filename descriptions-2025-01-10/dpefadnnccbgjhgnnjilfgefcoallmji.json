Think \"Get groceries next Thursday from 3:30 to 5pm\". They deprecated this feature, leaving millions of unhappy users in the process.\n\nGoogle Calendar Natural Language Input allows you to use a quick shortcut (Command + E) to open a textbox and type in whatever event you want in natural language to automatically create a Google Calendar event page with all the details pre-filled.\n\nFor example: press 'Command + E' (`Ctrl + E` on Windows) to pull up a text input to add your event details. \n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Have an event name. \"Get groceries\"\n2. Have a time or date. \"next Monday\", \"tonight at 7pm\", \"in 2 days at 6pm\"\n3. Optional: multiple events separated by a semicolon ;\n4. Optional: add a recurrence. \"everyday\", \"every 2 months\", \"every year\"\n5. Optional: add details. \"d(bring an umbrella\", \"d(read this before link.com)\"\n6. Optional: add a location \"l(Central Park)\", \"l(Pizza place on the corner)\"\n\nIf the extension doesn't work for you, go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` to see what other extensions are using the `Command+E` shortcut, and change them to something else.\n\nSee the info button in the extension for more details.\n\nHOW TO USE :\n1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store\n2. `Command+E` to open extension menu. Swap `Command` for `Ctrl` for all cases below for Windows users.\n3. Type an event name, date, and time in natural language, eg \"Get flowers for wife next week\" will create a calendar event called \"Get flowers for wife\" with the date 7 days from today. Another example: \"Schedule a call with Peter next Friday at 4pm\" will create a calendar event prepopulated for the following Friday at 4pm called \"Schedule a call with Peter\". \n4. Press `Enter`\n5. A Google Calendar page will open. Press `Command+S` to save the event, then `Command+W` to close.\n6. Congrats, you just created a calendar event using natural language with NO mouse movement! Your carpal tunnel thanks you."
