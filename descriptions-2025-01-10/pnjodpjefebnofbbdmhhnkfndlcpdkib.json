This powerful tool comes with two key functionalities to streamline your online experience:\n\nTab Management: Tab Me Up intelligently cleans up your browser by identifying and closing unnecessary tabs, reducing clutter and freeing up memory. It prioritizes your workflow by moving distracting URLs to a curated reading list, ensuring that interesting content is not lost but saved for later review. This feature helps maintain a clean browser interface, enabling you to focus on what's important.\n\nDistraction Blocking: Stay on track with your tasks as Tab Me Up blocks access to known distracting websites. Instead of outright blocking, it redirects these pages to your reading list, creating a balance between maintaining productivity and not missing out on content you find interesting. This approach encourages disciplined browsing habits, helping you stay focused on work or studies while keeping leisure content within reach for your downtime.\n\nTab Me Up is the perfect tool for professionals, students, and anyone looking to enhance their online efficiency. Say goodbye to endless tabs and distractions, and hello to a streamlined, productive browsing experience."
