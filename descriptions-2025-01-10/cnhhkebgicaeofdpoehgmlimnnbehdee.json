Both single-player and two-player modes are available in the game. Diamonds are used in the game to purchase bonuses from the Shop by collecting them. A diamond magnet, a 2x diamond counter, and armor for traps are some of these benefits. You may go farther in the single-player game mode by using these benefits.\n\nThe A,D and Left - Right Arrows keys are used to control the game. It offers a relaxed gaming experience and has bland visuals and calming music. Players may compete against one another on a high score scoreboard, and the game's mechanics and controls are designed to be realistic.\n\nIf you have any questions about our Two Ball 3D Unblocked game extension or just want to give us some feedback, feel free to send us a message or write a review!
