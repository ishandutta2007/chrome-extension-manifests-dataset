Problematic Internet Use is described as ”an inability to control one's use of the Internet which leads to negative consequences in daily life”.\n\nUnlike many other extensions, MIU will not provide a quick fix by blocking websites. MIU will instead focus on the reason behind the problem, the user's tendency to browse the web mindlessly. By repeatedly encouraging a more intentional and mindful usage of the internet this extension will help the user to quit undesirable internet use. \n\nThe goal of this extension is to give its user a tool to help them avoid mindless browsing and unintentional internet use. This will be done by encouraging the user to breathe and present quotes that remind the user what they value before allowing the user to access a listed website.\n\nNeither your quotes nor list of mindless websites will be sent anywhere, the data will remain secure on your own device.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/IvarssonAndreas/mindful-internet-use"
