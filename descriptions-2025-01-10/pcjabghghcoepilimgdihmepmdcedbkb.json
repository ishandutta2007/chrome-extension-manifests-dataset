Consumer journeys are more and more complicated in todayâ€™s interwined digital world and it is not possible for surveys to accurately capture user behaviour. The browser extension would serve to have a more accurate and real life mapping of user journeys.The purpose of this is to objectively understand journey  not of a particular user but of a particular segment of users (most often demographic or category users) in order to generalize their behaviour with reasonable confidence. This behaviour of user segments (aggregated group of users) will be tracked on a continuous basis in order to provide insights to marketeers on user needs and expectations and to improve consumer experience."
