Open Access Helper uses the trusted APIs from unpaywall.org and core.ac.uk to locate open access copies, making research more accessible for students, researchers, and curious minds.\n\nHow It Works\nWhen you view a research article, the extension detects its DOI (Digital Object Identifier) and checks for an available open access version. Simply click the Open Access Helper badge to access the document!\n\nAs you hover over the badge, it will indicate whether you‚Äôll be accessing the ‚ÄúPublished Version,‚Äù ‚ÄúAccepted Version,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSubmitted Version.‚Äù\n\nEZProxy or OpenAthens Made Simple\nIf your university library uses EZProxy or OpenAthens for off-campus access, this extension makes it seamless to connect. Just set your institution‚Äôs domain (e.g., harvard.edu), and with one click, you can proxy the current page through your library‚Äôs server.\n\n100% Legal and Privacy-Respecting\nEvery link provided leads to officially open-access or legally archived copies of research articles. Plus, Open Access Helper doesn‚Äôt collect personal data‚Äîjust anonymous usage stats to improve functionality.\n\nOpen Source & Developer-Friendly\nThis is a passion project‚Äîcheck out the code, share feedback, or report bugs. Your contributions and ideas are always welcome!\n\nüëâ Get started today‚Äîmake research easier and more accessible with Open Access Helper!",
    "de,fr,nl": "Effortless legal access to full text scholarly articles\n\nFIND OPEN ACCESS\n\nWhen you view a research article, Open Access Helper detects the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the document and then will query the APIs of unpaywall.org and core.ac.uk  to find a link for a legal open access copy. Simply click the Open Access Helper badge to access the document!\n\nOrange: open access is available at another location\nGreen: you should have access at this location\n\nIS IT LEGAL?\n\nIt‚Äôs perfectly legal, as these links are either to an official open access publication, or the author-archived manuscripts found at university and government web servers. \n\nAs you hover your mouse over the Open Access Helper badge, the extension will tell you whether you are going to see the ‚ÄúPublished Version‚Äù, ‚ÄúAccepted Version‚Äù or ‚ÄúSubmitted Version‚Äù. The two APIs employed are the gold standard for this type of information.\n\nWhen there is no open access version the extension will show you a blue badge, which will direct you to the service of openaccessbutton.org to request the author to make her work available within the boundaries of the publisher agreement for her work. There are no guarantees, but it‚Äôs worth a try! \n\nNote: the blue openaccessbutton.org badge is only shown for articles published within the last five years.\n\nSIMILAR ARTICLES\n\nA bronze badge will enable you to find similar articles based on CORE recommender. All recommended articles will be available from core.ac.uk and are published as open access\nwe use opencitations.net to show you how often the document was cited. You can click the badge to see a list of citing papers and find out what work was based on the work you originally found\n\nEZPROXY\n\nMany university libraries employ a remote access solution known as EZProxy. This solution functions by rerouting your connection through the institution‚Äôs server and thus making it look to the publisher as if you were on campus. All you have to do is access the settings, type the domain of your institution (e.g. harvard.edu for Harvard University) and save.\n\nWhen enabled, you can click on the toolbar icon (make sure it is visible) and the popup will show a button to proxy the current page. While I cannot guarantee that your library subscribes to the paper, it couldn‚Äôt be more convenient to at least try! In the future, I hope to make this feature more awesome.\n\nPRIVACY\n\nWhile every software developer‚Äôs nightmare, there is no telemetry sent to my servers about your usage of the extension. While I would love to have fancy graphs affirm that I don‚Äôt waste my time, I feel that your privacy is much more important.\n\nI have a full time job with a fun company, and if you are interested, just look at the code within the extension - it‚Äôs not minimised and has plenty of comments (and quite likely a bunch of bugs - do let me know about those, please!).\n\nFor full disclosure:\nwhen you enable EZProxy support, you will query the settings from my server\nwhen you request a CORE Recommendation the request will be handled by one of my servers\nNeither feature tracks you in any way",
