The user can then click a slot to select (or edit) which artifact they want for the character. Users can also input desired main and sub stats.\nWhen a slot is hovered, the information of the artifact is displayed.\n\nTo start using the extension, click the extension icon or head directly to https://genshin-center.com/planner\n\nRecent changes:\n1.5.7. (17.6.2024);\n- New Artifacts: \"Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy\" and \"Unfinished Reverie\"\n- (Sorry for the wait)\n1.5.6 (21.12.2023);\n- New Artifacts (V4.3): \"Song of Days Past\" and \"Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods\"\n\nNote that the extension is developed by kripi and NOT Genshin Center.\nFeedback and bug reports can be sent to me on Discord (kripi#6436).\nYou can also fill up the feedback survey: https://forms.gle/fzXzLfMit3jSLtdg8"
