Attempts to semantically interpret your query, and will return conversions for queries such as '1 kg to grams.'\n\nSupports many common units in the categories of Acceleration, Area, Charge, Density, Distance, Energy, Force, Mass, Mass Flow, Power, Speed, Temperature, Time, Torque, Viscosity, Volume, and Volume Flow.\n\nCurrency conversion has not yet been added since conversion rates change so quickly. It's on the to-do list to implement.\n\nThis is still in Beta stage, and there are quirks, although they shouldn't very noticeably affect the converter.\n\nMore units to come. I hope you find it useful."
