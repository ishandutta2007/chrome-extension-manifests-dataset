Use it to easily track the performance of the Internet connections you use over time. Conduct your own research on Internet connections worldwide.\n\nFeatures include running a test on demand, scheduling tests to run regularly, annotation of your test results, and CSV export of all test data. \n\nThe Measure App uses a test called the Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT), which is developed and maintained by Internet 2 and hosted by Measurement Lab (M-Lab). It is a sophisticated speed and diagnostic test suitable for both the novice and the network researcher. For more information on NDT and other M-Lab tests, please visit http://www.measurementlab.net/tools/ndt.\n\nFor help using the Measure App, please visit the wiki: https://github.com/m-lab/measure-app/wiki/Documentation"
