Our default list of alternatives is built from sources like https://switching.software/ and https://prism-break.org/en/\n\nThe extension ships with a default list of recommendations but you can subscribe to lists maintained by others. This allows different interpretations of \"better\" to exist and you can subscribe to those that appeals to your preferences the most.\n\nFor every URL pattern, multiple alternatives may exist. The first one is always shown as a primary recommendation with emphasis, and the rest are presented as secondary.\n\nThe pop-up shows an option to dismiss the suggestion forever for the current URL pattern. The extension needs permission to use localStorage for preserving these preferences.\n\nThe extension code itself as well as the default list is open-source and currently maintained at https://github.com/nileshtrivedi/better Users and developers are welcome to participate in the development and improve this extension."
