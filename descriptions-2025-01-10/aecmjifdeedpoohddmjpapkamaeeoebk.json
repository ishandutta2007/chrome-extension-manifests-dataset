No more attachments, no more downloads, no more unzipping.\n\nCreate a web URL for any file and folder. Paste it into Notion, Google Docs, Jira, Monday, etc. Open that file with a single click from your web browser. This saves you a lot of clicking and a lot of time.\n\nIt works great in a team. If your files are in a shared location like Dropbox, Google Drive or a local network storage anyone can open files from the browser by clicking the links.\n\nSay goodbye to scattered download folders, incorrect file versions, and duplicated work."
