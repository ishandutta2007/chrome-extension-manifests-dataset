Gets all the transactions that show up on OpenSea.\n\nDownload now and start tracking wallets of profitable Influencers or Whales!\n\nIf it helps you in anyway make sure to share it!\n\n\nWorking:\n\nYou'll need to sign up for a free plan to get an Etherscan API key from their website to get started. It doesn't involve suffering around to get your own OpenSea API key in anyway.\nOnce it receives the API key it'll start looping every 10 minutes to track NFT transactions made from each address that you provide. It will use Etherscan's API to find all ERC721 or ERC1155 transactions made by an address. If an NFT transaction is found it'll show a different icon to let you know.\n\n\nIf you encounter any Bugs or Issues feel free to contact me.\nI will do my best to resolve it asap!"
