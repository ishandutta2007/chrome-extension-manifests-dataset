TabCloser automatically closes leftover tabs from services like Figma, Spotify, and Zoom once they're redirected to their dedicated desktop applications. You can also specify custom URLs for TabCloser to handle on your behalf, perfect for cleaning up after SSO logins, VPNs, and more. Not using the desktop version of an app? No problemâ€”simply turn off TabCloser for that service and continue using it in your browser.\n\nWith TabCloser, keeping your tabs tidy and your focus sharp has never been easier. Whether you're opening a Figma file from Slack, launching a Zoom meeting from your calendar, or playing a Spotify playlist recommended by a friend, TabCloser ensures your browser remains organized. It's ideal for joining VS Code Live Share sessions, browsing Discord communities, or managing tasks in Asana or Linear. When you return to your browser, your tabs will be clean and clutter-free, allowing you to focus on what matters most.\n\nLearn more at https://tabcloser.com or browse the code on GitHub https://github.com/sethcottle/tabcloser"
