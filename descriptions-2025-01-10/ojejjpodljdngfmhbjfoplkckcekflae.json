When watching videos, it hides anything that isn't from the channel you're watching. For example, if you were watching a Tom Scott video, it'd only show videos from Tom Scott, and so on.\n2. When on the homepage (or trending page), it hides anything from any channel not on your subscription list.\n\nYou also don't have to fuss around with blacklists to make it work: just install it, and it does the rest for you."
