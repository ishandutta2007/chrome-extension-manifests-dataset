Each Chrome window can represent one task that you are working on and have only the tabs needed for that task. In Seshy we refer to each of these task contexts as 'sessions'.\n\nWhilst you are working it should be effortless to create, name, and switch between sessions. It should also be quick to close sessions you are no longer working on and re-open them later. This is what Seshy does!"
