Synesthetize can be configured to color as many or as few letters as you want in the colors you prefer, so you can use existing associations for a stronger effect.\n\nRead the study that inspired the extension: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0039799\n\nSource available at: https://github.com/gsavvas/Synesthete"
