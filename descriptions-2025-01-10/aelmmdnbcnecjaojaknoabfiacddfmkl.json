For this the extension adds a new button to the header navigation.\n\nWhen you click on it all posts made by anonymous users get collapsed in your stream and the button's icon changes.\n\nEnjoy your anonymous-free 9GAG stream!\n\n## Known Bugs & Limitations\n\nUnfortunately completely hiding or removing the anonymous posts will screw up scrolling using the keyboard shortcuts `J` and `K`. Therefore the blocked posts are \"hidden\" by restricting their height to 40px. This means those posts are still part of the stream but only their header is visible.\n\nBut this also means that scrolling using the keyboard shortcuts `J` and `K` will stop at these collapsed posts, too. This may give the impression that scrolling to the next post didn't work correctly."
