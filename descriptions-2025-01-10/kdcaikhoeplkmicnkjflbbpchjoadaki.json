You can tweak colors, use dark mode, and change other view options in the preferences menu.\n\nYour grades are automatically updated in the background. Whenever you open your Scorecard, you're looking at an up-to-date version of your grades without having to log in or wait for the page to load.\n\nSince your grades are updated in the background, you can also get notifications for new assignments as soon as they're detected. \n\nYou can access your grades via our website, scorecardgrades.com, which has a higher uptime and loading speed than Frontline. New features are coming soon to the website, including grade testing and a GPA calculator."
