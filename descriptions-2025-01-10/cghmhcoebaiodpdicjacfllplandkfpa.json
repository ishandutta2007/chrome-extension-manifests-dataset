Aren't we all.  Tired of seeing that name in print and the not-so-subtle bout of nausea induced when you think about our country (and nuclear) codes being handed over to a con man with the ego of a toddler.  \n\nThis little add-on I whipped up will replace that name with \"Snowflake\" my new nickname and the only way he is referred to in my house.  Why Snowflake?  Because he's just so sensitive.  \"Mine is the biggest!\"  \"The media is out to get me!\"  \"Everyone must love me!\"  What a tool."
