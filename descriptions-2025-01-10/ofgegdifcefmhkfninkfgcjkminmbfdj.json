Using this extension, you can specify the intervals (ranges) of those songs, and only those portions will be played.\n\nSpecifying Multiple Intervals\n‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\nAn input box appears just below the video. There, you should specify the intervals as a comma separated list. Example: \"00:00-00:30, 5:00-5:30\" (without quotes) specifies two intervals, namely, the first 30 seconds and then the 30 seconds after the 5-minute mark. On clicking 'Apply', these intervals are played one after another.\n\nTo make it easier to specify the intervals, two buttons 'Start' and 'End' are provided. This is how you should use them: Click 'Start' at time xx:xx. Then click 'End' at time yy:yy. This will automatically copy the interval \"xx:xx - yy:yy\" into the input box. Repeat this to add several intervals.\n\nBookmarking\n‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\nYou can also 'bookmark' the intervals that you have just applied (by clicking the 'Bookmark!' button). Next time you play the same video, those intervals are automatically loaded from bookmarks and only the corresponding portions are played. You can use this feature to essentially create a whole playlist of video segments (by first creating the playlist on YouTube, and then bookmarking the desired portions for individual videos in it).\n\nClicking the button 'All B.s' opens up a side pane where all the previously bookmarked interval lists are shown. If there are multiple lists for the same video, then the most recently added interval-list will load automatically. Here, you can also manually delete a bookmark.\n\nLooping\n‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\nFinally, there's an option to play the sequence of portions on a loop.\n\nConfigurable Options (** NEW **)\n‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\nClick this extension's icon and click options. (Alternatively, go to 'Manage Extensions', click this extension's 'Details' and click 'Extension options'.) There you can configure the following:\n1. Keyboard shortcuts for the Start and End buttons\n2. Set looping as the default behavior\n3. (Experimental feature) Allow up to 1 decimal place for seconds in the input. This will let you specify more granular intervals, like \"0:0 - 0:0.9\"\n\nAfter saving the settings, refresh existing YouTube tabs if any, for the changes to reflect.\n\nMiscellaneous\n‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\n- Timestamps can be in the hh:mm:ss format (e.g. \"00:00:00-1:00:00\" means the first 1 hour), or the mm:ss format, or just in seconds (\"0-3600\" also means the first 1 hour).\n- Intervals are ordered by their starting time. Overlapping intervals are merged.\n- This extension stores all the saved interval lists in a dedicated bookmarks directory called 'YoutubePartsBookmarks'. Ensure not to delete or modify it.\n\nThanks to users for providing valuable feedback."
