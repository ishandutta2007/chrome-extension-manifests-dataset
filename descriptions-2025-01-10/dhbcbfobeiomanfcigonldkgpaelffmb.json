This tool automatically detects and redirects you to higher quality or alternative versions of images on several popular websites. Whether you're shopping, news browsing, or video watching, this extension ensures you get the best image quality available.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Amazon: Auto-redirects Amazon images to their highest resolution counterparts.\n2. Adidas: Ensures you're viewing the crispest product images from adidas.\n3. eBay: No more blurry item images. Redirects to high-definition eBay product photos.\n4. BBC: Enjoy crystal clear visuals when browsing BBC images.\n5. Marktplaats: Experience better clarity with Marktplaats listings.\n6. Nike: Sharpens Nike product images for a better shopping experience.\n7. YouTube: Enhances both YouTube avatars and video thumbnails.\n8. AliExpress: No more low-res product images. Enjoy top-quality visuals when shopping on AliExpress.\n9. Google User Content: Google Photos and other images hosted by google will return the best available version.\n\nHow it Works:\nOnce activated, the extension constantly monitors the URLs you visit. When it detects you're on one of the supported websites, it discreetly works in the background to modify the image URLs. If a higher quality or more direct version of the image is found, it'll seamlessly redirect you to that image. This ensures that you always have access to the best image quality without any additional effort.\n\nExample of URL Rewrite:\n\nOriginal URL (YouTube video thumbnail): \nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/12345abcde/hqdefault.jpg\n\nAfter Using Hi-Res Redirector:\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/12345abcde/maxresdefault.webp\n\nIn this example, the extension recognized the original URL as a YouTube video thumbnail in 'hqdefault' resolution (480x360). It then automatically redirected to the highest resolution available, which is 'maxresdefault' (1920x1080) and in the .webp format for better compression and quality. This ensures you get to see the best quality thumbnail image available for the video.\n\nThis is just one instance. The extension works similarly across various websites as listed in the features, ensuring optimal image quality and viewing experience.\n\nNote: The extension is non-intrusive, prioritizing your browsing experience. It ensures that redirects are only made when necessary and only for the sites specified.\n\nPrivacy Assured: The Hi-Res Redirector does not store, transmit, or sell your data. It operates solely within your browser.\n\nImprove your online visual experience with the Hi-Res Redirector!"
