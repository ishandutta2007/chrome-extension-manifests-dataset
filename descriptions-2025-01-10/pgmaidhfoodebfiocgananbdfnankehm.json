Works both on search result pages and single torrent pages.\n\nNote: on a search result page you need to hover over the magnet icon for a moment if you want the link to contain the trackers. When the icon becomes highlighted, it means that the trackers have been added, altough the link will also work without them. On single pages trackers are added instantly.\n\nThe extension works on all official Torrentz-sites but not on proxies. Supporting proxies is under consideration.\n\nIt's written in vanilla JavaScript and is over six times smaller in size than its rivals.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/bodyflex/torrentz-magnet"
