You can mute instead!\n- Optional messages tell you who you've blocked and even allow you to unblock them- and flag them to not be blocked again\n- Supports every major location tweets show up\n    - Search Results\n    - Tweet replies and threads\n    - For You and your home timeline\n    - User Pages\n- Optionally also block users with NFT avatars\n\nEndorsed by @dril!\n\nSupport or contribute to Blue Blocker's development on GitHub: https://github.com/kheina-com/Blue-Blocker"
