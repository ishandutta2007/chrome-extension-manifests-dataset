As self-taught students who rely on YouTube to learn, we decided to change that.\nScholarMode is the first educational platform designed for self-taught individuals, it's the same  YouTube you know and love but now you get to structure your own learning and sidestep the YT vortex. \nWe've created a voted discussion section next to every video, so everyone gets to see the best questions and answers by voting ~ kinda like a mini-reddit for self-taught students & creators.\n\nWelcome to ScholarMode ðŸŽ“\n\nnote: The extension is currently in Beta and we are constantly improving it, if you have any feedback for bug-reports or feature-requests we'd love to keep making this platform better ðŸ™‚\n\nSend us a quick request here: [scholarmode.com/#bug-report](http://scholarmode.com/#bug-report)\nor email us at: [info@scholarmode.com](mailto:info@scholarmode.com)\n\nHave fun learning!"
