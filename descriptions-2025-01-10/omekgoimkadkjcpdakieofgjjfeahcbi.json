The main idea of this software lies in creation of a skeleton, which you are going to animate. A skeleton consists of bones that you can rotate, move and re-size the way you want. Each frame of an animation corresponds to a specific set of bone's coordinates. Each bone requires a texture for rendering. The greatest feature of the software is a real-time rendering. It means that every little change of bone's coordinates that you make immediately renders in a preview movie. You can produce a lot of different characters using the same model simply changing textures in several clicks. The Anatomy 2 tool automatically packs all frames of an animated sprite into a single sprite sheet. As a result, you get an excellent tool to make 2D sprite sheets."
