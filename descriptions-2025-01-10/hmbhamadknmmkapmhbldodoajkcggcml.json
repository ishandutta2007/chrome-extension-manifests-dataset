You can be in Window A and if something is playing in Window B, Window B will be focused in the playing tab.\n\nBy default no keyboard shortcuts are specified, to set them go to Settings -> Extensions -> Keyboard Shortcuts (it's at the bottom).\n\nIt can also close playing tabs with a keyboard shortcut or by right clicking on the icon. When you do the command once it will close all tabs emitting sound except the current tab, do the command again and it will close the current tab (if it's emitting sound). This is good if you're watching something and want to close all other tabs that are emitting sound except the thing you're watching.\n\nI recommend using the keyboard shortcuts, I find them very useful, especially when they're set to global.\n\nUpdate V2:\n- Support for changing between 2 different playing tabs.\n- Added keyboard shortcut to close all playing tabs.\n\nUpdate V3:\n- Fixed a thing pertaining global hotkeys and window focus.\n\nUpdate V4:\n- Made it so it wont close a playing tab that is focused unless it's the only one left.\n\nUpdate V5:\n- Added a context menu to close playing tabs. Right click the icon to see it.\n- Fixed a problem with not all tabs closing.\n- Now it cycles through all tabs that are emitting sound not just two.\n\nUpdate V6:\n- Now with true multi window support.\n\nUpdate V6.3\n- There are no longer default keyboard shortcuts to avoid interrupting workflows. You can set them manually in the settings.\n\nUpdate V7.0\n- It now uses manifest v3.\n\nKeywords:\n\nGo to tab emitting sound\nChange to tab with sound\nShow tab that is sounding\nMaking noise\nClose tabs with sound\nClose tabs emitting sound"
