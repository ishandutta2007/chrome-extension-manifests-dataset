It supports almost all known formats, including text, link, ISBN,  coupon, and contact. \n\nPrivacy:\nThis extension does not rely on any external services to perform detection. There is no server-side interaction whatsoever. \n\nFeatures:\n1. Read multiple QR-codes on a single image\n2. Supports multiple protocols\n3. Saves the history of scanned items\n4. Drop local image files to the user interface\n5. Uses both native method and ZBar library to maximize the detection power.\n\nThis extension uses ZBar c-library, to extract multiple QR-codes and barcodes in a single image frame.\n\nWhat is a QR code?\nIt is a type of matrix barcode that is a machine-readable optical label. \nA QR code contains information about the item to which it is attached. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently.\n\nWhat is a barcode?\nIt is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form. Initially, barcodes represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines."
