Fully supports both English and German based on the Moses language setting.\n\nWhen installed, the extension will display the possibility to add custom events below your Moses calendar. These events are preserved between reloads and even between sessions. They display exactly like native events created by Moses itself. Tutorial dates can also be displayed in the calendar. You can also toggle the display of events, and delete events you no longer need."
