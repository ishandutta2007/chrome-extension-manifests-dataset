This game gives you two options and is generally played in a group. Take turns and have fun answering what you would rather do. Feel free to leave me suggestions or any feedback in general, it is greatly appreciated and I work on these regularly.\n\nCurrent features:\n- Mix and match, the match option gives questions that are related to each other and the mix option gives questions that are random\n- Coming soon shows what I'm working on"
