Even though it's a user protection measure from Chrome, you may find it annoying. You already know that it's blocked by NxFilter because you wanted to block it as the administrator of your network. And you want to notify your users why they blocked from the website to prevent further access violation by them. So, we provide CxForward to display the block page correctly even if you want to block a website on HTTPS."
