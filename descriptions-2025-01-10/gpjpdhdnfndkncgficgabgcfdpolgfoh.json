This extension is named after Bean the Cat, who enjoys being my copilot while I play Spelling Bee. He gives great hints.\n\nCurrent features include:\n- A more clear, graphical representation of the NYT hints table that updates as you submit answers\n- \"Bigger hints\" for when you really get stuck. You can reveal a chosen amount of letters for a randomly-chosen word that you haven't guessed yet.\n- Revealing all of the puzzle's answers. To help with those truly obscure \"words\", each answer links to its definition in the OED.\n- Custom rank names for those who feel that the normal NYT rank names are too broadly positive. Maybe instead of \"Moving Up\", you want to have your current rank displayed as \"Donkey Brains\". Now you can!\n- An optional \"Evil Mode\", where Bean the Cat will \"steal\" one of the 7 letters for each incorrect guess that you submit"
