Including:\n\n* Lets you write a comma separated list of authors and have them expanded into author fields so that you don't have to to copy one name at a time.\n\n* Auto-generates \"Sort by\" from title because it takes less time than writing a sort by, even if you have to change one or two letters.\n\n* Expand the cover photo on the book edit page so that you can check exactly what it says.\n\n* Highlights most recent book in the combination list to make it easier to find the edition to separate.\n\n* Shows the work id by each work on the combine page.\n\n* Allows editions to be separated directly from the book edit page.\n\n* Warns about mismatch between ISBN10 and ISBN13\n\n* Warns about invalid ISBNs to cover when someone has put a truncated ISBN13 in the ISBN10 field.\n\n* Auto-generates ISBN13 from ISBN10, to avoid cases where a edition ends up with one ISBN13 instance and one ISBN10 instance.\n\n* Auto-enable \"keyword\" when writing text in the combine search field so that the user doesn't have to redo the search after forgetting to do it.\n\n* Puts the three most recently used languages at the top of the language select because if you work on a language specific group of books, scrolling that dropdown takes too long.\n\nCompacts the author edit page a bit to reduce the amount of scrolling needed to get to the save button."
