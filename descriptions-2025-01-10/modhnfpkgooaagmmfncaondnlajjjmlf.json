To load messages there, just read your neo mails as usual and they will be automatically added.\n\nThe extension does not automate any player activity, or provide data that would otherwise be inaccessible; it only helps to facilitate better searching, sorting, and organisation of your neomails.\n\nYou can view the project on https://github.com/juvian/NeoChat\n\nThis software is not endorsed by or affliated with Neopets."
