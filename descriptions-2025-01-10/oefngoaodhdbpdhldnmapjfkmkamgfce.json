My steps would look like:\n1. Read through numerous travel blogs, discussion forums and articles, manually noting down the best ramen places people suggest. \n2. Of the places listed, look up each place on Google Maps to find distance/travel time from my residence. See if visiting that restaurant is feasible given my plan for the day.\n3. Finally shortlist the restaurant I can actually visit. \n\nThe above is extremely time-consuming. To save on time and find a better way, I created this Chrome extension.\n\nThe Solution:\nThis Chrome extension automatically identifies and maps locations mentioned on any web page. Whether you're reading a food blog, reddit forum, a travel article, or a local guide, Map your Travel instantly creates an interactive map of all mentioned places on that webpage, complete with travel times and distances from your location.\n\nKey Features:\n1. Automatic restaurant names extraction from any web page\n2. Interactive mapping with Google Maps integration\n3. Travel time and distance calculations"
