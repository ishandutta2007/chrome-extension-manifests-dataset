Additionally, there were options I wanted which they didn't provide, so I made this extension to help.\n\nFeatures:\n- Optionally remove the imposing advertisement areas and other features from the page, such as:\n    Wordplay section\n    The sitemap footer\n    Scrolling alternate puzzles carousel\n    \n- Adds the ability to show/hide the across or down clues, for those that want an additional challenge\n\n- Adds a keyboard shortcut (CMD+0) for the pencil tool, for easy switching\n\nI hope you enjoy this extension, please get in touch with any requests for features or improvements!"
