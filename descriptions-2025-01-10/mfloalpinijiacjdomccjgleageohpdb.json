I have been on the Roblox platform for 13 years at this point and have been developing games for the past few. I've even attended the developer conference. https://www.roblox.com/users/13948925/profile\n\nWhat game ID do I enter?\nIf you wish to get the Robux yourself, enter any game id under a group that you own! Otherwise if you wish to support another person or group, use any game id under their group."
