They serve as the sole check and balance for the state of Utah, a state that can at times be either theocracy or oligarchy. The Trib is a great paper, they employ great journalists, but I find their website to be hard to read. This extension cleans up the look and feel of the site in a small way, as well as adds some functionality to enhance reading such as opening articles in full-page view by default. \n\nThis is still in development, so if you have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact me. This project is also open-source, and available on GitHub.\n\n***\nVersion 0.6: Updates\n* Removed connatix and other video content from displaying in the center of articles\n* Disabled the full-page pop-up ad when you alnd on the home page."
