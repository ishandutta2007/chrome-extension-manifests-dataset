You can refund charges, cancel subscription, create new charges and more. Customers matched based on their email address which allows our extension to work on any web page which contains email addresses. When a customer is found, a tag showing the customer's latest or total payments is added next to their email address.\n\nIf you do not have a ChargeDesk account, one will be created for you when you connect your payment gateway after installing the extension. This only takes a few seconds.\n\nSupported Gateways: https://chargedesk.com/gateways\nSupported Helpdesks: https://chargedesk.com/helpdesks\n\nMany helpdesks and web-based email programs will work by default. The ChargeDesk extension will also work with your internal web-based dashboards where you display email addresses. If the system you use does not work with ChargeDesk, please email us at contact@chargedesk.com and we'll take a look.\n\n---\n\nFast\n\nThis extension has been optimised to use only the minimum resources required to operate. When not needed it will unload and will not continue running in the background. We've used some clever algorithms to allow us to really quickly scan your pages for customers. We only send the bare minimum information back to our servers and use caching to wherever possible.\n\n---\n\nSecure\n\nThe ChargeDesk extension has been built with security as a core feature. All communication to our servers is performed using the latest encryption algorithms. When looking up customers on web pages you visit, the data is secured using a one-way hash. This means that no information about your browsing behaviour is ever accessible from our servers.\n\nWe offer 2 factor authentication as an additional security measure. You can require this for accessing any customer information, or only when performing updates (such as refunding a charge). By using revokable access tokens, even if your personal computer is attacked, your underlying payment gateway will not be compromised.\n\n---\n\nPricing that scales with your business\n\nYour first 14 days of using ChargeDesk are free of charge! This allows you to test the service and in the (incredibly unlikely) case you find it's not for you, you pay nothing. Plans start at $29/mo. Further information can be found at https://chargedesk.com/pricing\n\n---\n\nRelease notes:\n12 December 2024 - Updated support for Intercom\n8 July 2024 - Updated support for Hubspot Help Desk workspace\n19 June 2024 - Added support for Hubspot Help Desk workspace\n13 June 2024 - Bug fixes\n12 June 2024 - Upgraded to manifest V3\n7 December 2023 - Updated Hubspot integration\n30 November 2023 - Updated support for new Help Scout Inbox\n8 April 2023 - Updated support for new Intercom Inbox\n10 July 2022 - Added support for new Intercom Inbox\n12 May 2022 - Fixed issue with Hubspot integration\n2 September 2021 - Added support for Shopify, Improved support for Zendesk Workspaces\n23 Feb 2021 - Updated several integrations, added support for multiple email & phone matches at once\n4 June 2020 - Updated Intercom Integration\n14 April 2020 - Bug fixes\n28 February 2020 - Big fixes, Upgraded HubSpot support\n20 July 2019 - Added HubSpot support\n16 March 2019 - Upgraded extension for Chrome 73 site isolation compatibility\n18 December 2018 - Added more information to customer tags\n13 December 2018 - Even more Freshdesk fixes\n11 December 2018 - Further Freshdesk upgrades and other bug fixes\n5 December 2018 - Upgraded Freshdesk support\n26 November 2018 - Upgraded Help Scout support\n29 October 2018 - Bug fixes and performance tweaks\n17 October 2018 - Bug fixes and performance tweaks\n22 September 2018 - Bug fix for processing email tags with dots in them\n15 August 2018 - Compatibility with new Freshdesk Mint apps\n6 July 2018 - More Help Scout upgrades\n15 June 2018 - Help Scout upgrades\n24 April 2018 - Performance upgrades\n2 April 2018 - App now matches Intercom's redesign\n21 January 2018 - Improved email charge tagging\n20 December 2017 - Support for new Help Scout design\n15 November 2017 - Added support for Freshdesk Mint UI\n13 November 2017 - Intercom & general bug fixes\n29 July 2017 - Intercom and Desk fixes\n29 May 2017 - Added support for tagging exact charge related to support tickets\n26 May 2017 - Zendesk upgrades\n5 May 2017 - Even more support for Intercom upgrades!\n1 April 2017 - More support for Intercom upgrades\n28 March 2017 - More support for Intercom upgrades\n25 March 2017 - Support for Intercom upgrades\n22 March 2017 - Fixed issue matching Desk.com support emails\n4 February 2017 - Fixed customer tag styling and an issue with 3rd party script conflicts\n14 December 2016 - Fixed Help Scout rendering issue\n7 December 2016 - Support for Intercom domain change\n6 November 2016 - Major update!
