To have a brand, be active on your social media, they said.\n\nThen came a hundred social platforms, and a thousand ways to interact with people. Now, do you keep up with posting, interacting and meme-ing, or do you actually run a business? Do you find yourself choosing between one or the other? Have you ever said, “I wish someone would do this for me…”?\n\nIf you did, you’re in luck. As someone facing these exact problems, I set out to use existing automation solutions for social media content. But there never was a solution that would “just work.” I’d need to have API access, or a business account, or be on a paid plan for more than 3 networks, or this or that and something or the other.\n\nHello!? I wanted to save time; not spend more of it.\n\nAnd therefore, to use a phrase that’s super common these days, I set out to scratch my own itch and built my own automation solution. But that’s not the big thing. The big thing is that I don’t need to do anything extra to “enable” or “allow” these automation steps. No API or business account or paid plan nonsense.\n\nIntroducing Skedule. A Chrome Extension that listens to you, works for you and interacts with websites as you would. A solution where YOU are in control, not the websites."
