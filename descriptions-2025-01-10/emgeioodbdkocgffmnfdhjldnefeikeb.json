Blocked tweets appear in a collapsed state that can be expanded with the \"toggle visibility\" button. Tweets can be unblocked by re-clicking the \"X\" or visiting the options page, where a list of all blocked tweets can be viewed.\n\nThis extension is currently in very-beta release. If you find a bug please report it to the github repo (set as the webpage for this extension.)\n\nHappy blocking!"
