This is a great tool for generating reports for your business needs.\n\nOther existing products rely on Google's Timeline API behind the scene. Due to Google's rate limiting on the API, it may be difficult to get all the data even just across several months. This chrome extension, on the other hand, processes Google's Takeout data, so that it can easily crunch through multiple months worth or even years worth of data in one go.\n\nBy the way, it also handles timezone.\n\nNone of your location data goes through a server. Everything is processed locally in your browser to ensure your privacy.\n\nv2.0\nOn December 12, 2023 Google announced that it will no longer store user's location/timeline data directly on its server. Instead, your location data will be stored directly on your device going forward.  I've made changes to handle this change. One caveat is that there is an additional step to convert the place IDs to human readable addresses and names.\nCheck out the instructions here: https://github.com/noitcudni/google-takeout-mileage-and-timeline-exporter-extension?tab=readme-ov-file#json-file-from-your-device\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid product."
