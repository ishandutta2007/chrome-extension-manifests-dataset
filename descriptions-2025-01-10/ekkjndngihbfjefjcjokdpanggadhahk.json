Aged care provider staff who manage the content of an AlayaCare system currently have to go to a specific client page to see the title (Mr/Mrs/Miss etc.) and the preferred name of any client, while a preferred option would be to see this information on the top of every page in the existing client name header. This issue is what this extension aims to resolve.\n\nAfter installing this extension and logging into an AlayaCare CMS, when you go to a client page, a new Chrome tab will automatically open, to gather the client title and preferred name, then automatically close and update the client name header on the client page you are currently on. For example, if the title displayed James Smith, after the extension script has run, it might now display, Mr James (Jim) Smith, if Jim is the clients preferred name.\n\nThe extension will also cache client name changes, so any future page opening on a client who has already been updated will not require a new tab open and so be much quicker to load. The cache is retained until all your Google Chrome instances are closed. \n\nIf someone has inadvertently added the preferred name to the client first name field already in the format \"James (Jim)\", and the exact same preferred name eg. Jim is in the preferred name field, the extension will omit the duplication ie. instead of showing \"Mr James (Jim) (Jim) Smith\" it will still show \"Mr James (Jim) Smith\". However, if the preferred name in the client first name field and the preferred name in the client preferred name field differ, then both will be shown eg. \"Mr James (Jim) (Jimmy) Smith\" and this data issue should be resolved by AlayaCare CMS officers."
