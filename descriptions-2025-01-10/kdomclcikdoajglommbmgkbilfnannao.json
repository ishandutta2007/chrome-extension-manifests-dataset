No complicated settings. Not recognized or blocked by YouTube's detector as an adBlock extension. Does not violate YouTube policy. Enjoy :)\n\nInstallation and first run.\nAfter installation, it is recommended to completely restart your browser, closing all old tabs. This will ensure stable operation of the extension. Otherwise, ads may remain on old tabs even with YouAd Killer enabled. Further in the process of use, these actions do not need to be repeated.\n\nLocalization.\nTranslation of the extension text may be inaccurate. Please inform me about errors and inaccuracies (specify the language). A linguist is needed in the team for the same reason.\n\nFor all questions and suggestions: youadkiller@gmail.com\n\nP.S.: I am a young developer building my team. Please contact me if you want to help in developing projects."
