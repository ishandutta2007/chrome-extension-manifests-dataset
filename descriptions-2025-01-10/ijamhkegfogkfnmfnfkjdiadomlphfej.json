The same applies to visualizing your assets on Pull Request reviews!\n\nSome Open Source projects were vital for the development of this extension, and we would like to thank all of them, with highlights to:\n\n- CNCF Serverless Workflow SDK Typescript: for workflow parsing;\n- Mermaid: for workflow rendering and visualization;\n- Apicurio: for our service catalog integration;\n\n---\n\nApache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software\nFoundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is\nrequired of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that\nthe infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized\nin a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation\nstatus is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the\ncode, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.\n\nSome of the incubating project’s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF\npolicy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing\nconditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently\naware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):\n\n- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of relicensing to ASL v2\n- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may be missing the ASF Licensing Header\n-\n\n- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used.
