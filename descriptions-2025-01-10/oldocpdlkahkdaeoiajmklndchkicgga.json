While writing tests in automation tools like Cypress.js it is easier write tests if the elements have an id associated with them. Especially true for your input and button fields.\n2. Helping accessibility tools like screen readers by having a meaningful ID rather than a browser generated one.\n\nThis tool is like a visual linter that highlights the elements that do not have an element.id associated with it. Can be used by developers and tests as part of the development cycle.\nFor feedback please write to info@cloudmpower.com"
