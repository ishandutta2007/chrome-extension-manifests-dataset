It is not intended to be a stand-alone Chrome extension.\n\nHttpWatch supports many additional features compared to the built-in DevTools network panel:\n\n- Supports multi-page debugging by grouping requests by page\n\n- Supports automatic recording and logging of network traffic in each Chrome tab without additional user intervention\n\n- Displays warnings about well know performance and security issues, e.g. ineffective cache settings\n\n- Advanced Find and Filter functions make it easier to locate requests or content\n\n- Automatically masks out passwords in POST form data so that they are not recorded in HWL or HAR files\n\n- Built in summaries of page level statistics, e.g. bytes downloaded, network round trips, etc\n\n- Add comments to requests to help subsequent analysis of log files\n\n- Directly email HWL or HAR files from within the tool\n\nCurrently the tool is Windows only and requires a separate download from https://www.httpwatch.com to complete the installation once the Chrome Extension is installed.\n\nHttpWatch acts as an in-browser HTTP sniffer and displays detailed information about HTTP(S) requests generated by Chrome. This information includes:\n\n- HTTP headers\n- HTTP cookies\n- Status codes and errors\n- Query Strings\n- POST Data\n- Content - image, textual and binary\n- Timings"
