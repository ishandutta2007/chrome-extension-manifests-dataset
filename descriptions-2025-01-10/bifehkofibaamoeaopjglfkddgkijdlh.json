Sometimes, a manual installation is necessary (e.g. if you use the portable version of JabRef). In this case, please follow the steps described in the user manual: https://docs.jabref.org/import-export/import/jabref-browser-extension\n\nUsage\nAfter the installation, you should be able to import bibliographic references into JabRef directly from your browser.\nJust visit a publisher site or some other website containing bibliographic information (for example, the arXiv) and click the JabRef symbol in the Firefox search bar (or press Alt+Shift+J).\nOnce the JabRef browser extension has extracted the references and downloaded the associated PDF's, the import window of JabRef opens.\n\nYou might want to configure JabRef so that new entries are always imported in an already opened instance of JabRef.\nFor this, activate \"Remote operation\" under the Advanced tab in the JabRef Preferences.\n\nJabRef: https://www.jabref.org/\nInstallation instructions for manual setup: https://docs.jabref.org/import-export/import/jabref-browser-extension\n\nPlease post any issues or suggestions on GitHub: https://github.com/JabRef/JabRef-Browser-Extension/issues"
