This data is culled from the ORK, so the user must have a known ORK entry for this bar to appear.\n\nUsers with very low activity levels or no activity will have red bars, low activity levels will have orange, semi-activite users will have yellow bars, and active users will have green bars, with the bar size increasing as their percentage of activity increases.\n\nNext to the activity bar are ratings for users. Ratings are for martial skill (grey), artistic ability and vision (green), intelligence and wisdom (purple), and friendliness and approachability (blue). \n\nThis extension includes a hovercard that shows additional information about the user when the ratings chart is hovered over.\n\nThe ratings are curated. Users can provide updated data for other users, which will be reviewed by the curators."
