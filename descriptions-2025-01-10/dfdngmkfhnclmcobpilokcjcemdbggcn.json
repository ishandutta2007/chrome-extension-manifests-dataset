This means that special attention must be paid to the different limits to avoid surprises.\n\nYou can find many of those limits spread out in the setup or leveraging the standard Salesforce API (tooling api, rest api or limit api). Wouldn't it be great to have a dashboard where you could check all these limits at a glance, without having to collect all this information on your own each time you need them? Well, that is exactly what Salesforce Limits does.\n\nWith this extension you can build your own dashboards with a few clicks."
