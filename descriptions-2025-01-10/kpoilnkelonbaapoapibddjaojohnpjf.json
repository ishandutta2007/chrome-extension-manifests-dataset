In that respect, it's like an old usenet killfile. It does not affect what other visitors to the site will see.\n\nThis is not a tool meant for handling spam, only for an individual comment reader to avoid having to see comments they don't wish to see.\n\nWhen the script works for a given blog, comments will have a [hush] link near the commentor's name. (visible only on mouseover!) Clicking on that will hide comments from that person from then on."
