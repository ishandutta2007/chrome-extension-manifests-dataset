Make an issue on our Github! We're not too stubborn to make anything optional.\n\n---\n\n¹ Quote threading rearranges the thread to be more readable when you first open it, so replies to a post will be placed right underneath it. It works with the updater, as well, and accounts for your viewport to ensure you never miss a post.\n² Performance can be benchmarked by opening the sticky on /m/.\n³ Emoji are small icons that appear next to the email field when you enter in a specific email. Enable them and look around the website to find them! They're especially popular on /g/ and /a/."
