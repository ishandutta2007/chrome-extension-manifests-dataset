    "zh_CN": "This browser extension allows users to initiate outgoing calls by clicking directly on phone numbers found in emails, websites, and most web-based CRMs.\n\nOur efficient number tagging system identifies phone numbers located in multiple areas of your browser - whether it is a number located in an email signature or even your web searches for pizza delivery for your company party!  This tagging system makes connecting to your destination as easy as a click of the mouse.  Compared to other click-to-call products available today, ESI's tagging system outshines the others by identifying more correct phone numbers, while ignoring more incorrect ones.\n\nAs part of ESI Click-to-Call, users receive a screen pop notification that shows on your web browser and/or your main computer desktop.  We've all had those moments where we've forgotten that we turned our ringer volume down, or couldn't hear the phone ringing because we were using headphones, and this visual screen pop feature means that you won't miss that next important call while you're sitting at your computer.\n\nNOTE:\n-You must have an active extension on the eSIP PBX."
