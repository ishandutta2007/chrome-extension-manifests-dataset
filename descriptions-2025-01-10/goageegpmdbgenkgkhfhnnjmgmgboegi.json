Seizafe is (specially ðŸŒ¼) designed for people with Photosensitive-Epilepsy / any other neurological disorder,  keeping you safe from unexpected jarring/flashing/bright transitions in videos which could cause deadly Photosensitive seizures. Since anyone can develop epilepsy, Seizafe is an ideal solution to narrow down the chances of you developing the condition, even as a healthy individual. \n\nThe sensitivity of the algorithm to identify flashing content can be adjusted to your preference via the sensitivity controls in the pop-up menu on our extension.\n\nSeizafe is ideal for public computer labs/kiosks/lounges eg. in hotels, schools, hospitals, offices, airports etc. Public safety is a very important value to keep those around us safe, even from the simple but unexpected dangers of videos.\n\nSeizafe is one Chrome Extension with a greater story behind it. Be safe. Be kind.ðŸ’œ"
