It also provides a snapshot of the stack data.\n\n- Action Dispatcher\nInstead of just checking the stack status, you can trigger actions like push and pop to inject your favorite activities into your Stackflow app.\nThe Action Dispatcher also has the ability to read the activities that you pass as params to the stackflow() function and automatically generate a form for the activity params needed for the action.\n\n- Event Logger\nView a log of events that have affected the stack."
