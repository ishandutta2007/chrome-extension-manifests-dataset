When they're not around, do you squint and partially cover your vision as you navigate through NBC.com? Do you put in all this effort just to have the episode spoiled for you by one of the endless clips, titles, or pieces of promotional text that NBC shoves down our throat when all we want to do is to watch SNL without knowing who the host is until they walk out onto the stage for the monologue?\n\nLive in fear no longer! SNL Host Hider is here to help.\n\nSNL Host Hider blocks all SNL-related content on NBC.com, from the homepage to the search bar to the SNL page itself. Avoiding spoilers just got this much easier.\n\nHappily click through NBC.com without depending on friends or luck! Jump for joy as you learn for the first time that John Mulaney or Benedict Cumberbatch or Tina Fey is hosting tonight as Darrell Hammond triumphantly belts out their name at the end of the opening credits, and no earlier!"
