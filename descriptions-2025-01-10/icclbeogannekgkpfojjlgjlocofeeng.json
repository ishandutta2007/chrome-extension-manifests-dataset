I got a problem when reading in my big 4k monitor, the article text became too small and harder to read without make my eyes closer to the screen. Other thing that bothers me is, many web don't have its own dark mode option.\n\nTwo problem above become the first two feature of Read-Y to solve. I created range input to zoom in and out the text to make it more readable. Also a button to enable Read-Y dark mode to the entire website. Later i will add more feature to this extension."
