(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiracing).\n\nWith this extension, you can play Wikiracing directly from Wikipedia Page together with your friends!\n\nHow to play:\nTo play, you have to open (any) Wikipedia page first (because this extension only has permission for wikipedia, not other sites). Then you can click the extension icon to show popup.\n\nYou can play single player (default), or click \"Create/join multiplayer room\" to play with your friends. After creating a room, you can share the link by clicking \"Copy Room Link\" on the extension popup, or just copy your url. Note that your friends must install the extension beforehand. If this extension is already installed, then opening any shared room link will prompt you to enter a username, and after that you will join the room.\n\nHappy Wikiracing!\n\nFeatures:\n- Play Wikiracing with the original Wikipedia experience\n- Play with your friends by sharing your own room\n- Support all 304 languages of Wikipedia\n- Custom score metrics! (number of clicks / time / combined!)\n- Optional challenging rules! (disable Ctrl+F, disable article preview, ban some articles, and more!)\n- And more to come!\n\nData Usage:\nThis extension will log the pages you visit for debugging purposes, **only on Wikipedia pages** and **only when you have an active game**. This extension **will do nothing if you don't have any running game** and **does not have any access to sites other than Wikipedia**.\n\nIf you are still unsure, (and if you have a little programming experience), you can always review the source code here: https://github.com/azaky/wikigame. It is (and will always be) open source.\n\nAlso, any suggestion will be appreciated! Just create new issue on the Github page if you have any issues/feedbacks/feature requests."
