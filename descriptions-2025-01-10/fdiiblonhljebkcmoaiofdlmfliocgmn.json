Those don't work because you eventually just uninstall or disable them to continue your guilty pleasure. Rather than blocking you, this extension slows you down before you can visit time-wasting websites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Reddit.\n\nWhen you try to visit one of those websites, it asks you how long you'd like to browse it for. Then you must wait 20 seconds before you can gain access. This helps break the dopamine loop associated with easily visiting these websites multiple times a day. When the time you defined is up, the tab closes.\n\nGo to settings to set websites you don't want to visit, like:\nhttps://x.com\n\nIf you still want to be able to see certain pages of that website (say someone sends you a tweet), you can whitelist them with wildcards, like this:\nhttps://x.com/*/status"
