This extension powers up your team collaboration experience. Note that an account on Tandem is required to use this extension.\n\nMeet in Tandem\n\nOn Google Calendar, when creating new events and editing existing events, you can now create Tandem meeting links to meet with your team or anyone outside your company. These meeting links only allow access to the meeting, not your entire Tandem team.\n\nGet on the same page\n\nYou can also send the current tab you are viewing to your teammates with a click. Just click the Tandem button in the Extensions area next to your browser's URL bar to get started.\n\nCollaborate fluidly\n\nYou'll be able to see your teammates cursors (helpful to indicate things while talking) if you join them from a call and both of you have the Chrome Extension. You can turn on cursor sharing any time from the popup menu.\n\nFinally, on Linux, this extension adds the URL of the page you are viewing to the tab title so that Tandem can share work app statuses."
