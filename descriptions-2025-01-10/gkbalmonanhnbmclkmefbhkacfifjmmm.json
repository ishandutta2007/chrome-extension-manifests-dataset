It links to the data you provide as context and uses it as reference when responding to queries. You can upload data directly, import data from our cloud drive partners, supply an URL for automatic scraping, or provide direct text input. You can embed the chatbot onto your own website or use it in Slack.\n\nWhere is my data stored?\nWe are a Software-as-a-Service. This means that our app, along with data you upload to us, resides online. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting. Our servers are located in Oregon, USA.\n\nDoes it support other languages?\nYes. Our service currently uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 large language models (LLMs) for generative AI functionality. The models are trained on publicly available data across the internet in over 95 languages, so GPT Trainer also supports over 95 languages.\n\nWhat should my data look like?\nWe support most text document formats (.pdf, .docx, .txt, .md, .tex). You can also provide an URL for automatic scraping of text content (this is not automatically updated on target website refresh), or input your own text directly.\n\nDoes it use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4?\nOur back end is designed to be versatile in Large Language Model (LLM) selection. Currently, we have GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 as options, but we plan on adding more LLMs (e.g. Google Bard, Meta LlaMA, Anthropic Claude, open source alternatives, etc.) when they become more mature.\n\nCan I share a chatbot I created?\nInput-wise, you are the only administrator to the design, customization, and data of your chatbot.
