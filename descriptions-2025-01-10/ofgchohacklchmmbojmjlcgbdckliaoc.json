Cereal Com can send and receive data as well as storing data and sending text files. You can change many settings including port, baud rate, parity, stop bits and flow control. Send commands to your Arduino or another RS232 device!  There is a thorough help menu and other features to help you see the data the way you want to see it.\n\nWith the most recent update you can now read Binary text coming into your serial port! There is a new option in the settings that allows you to convert binary to hex and choose how many binary characters to read. Check it out!\n\nI also added more control characters per user request (backspace and arrows now send).\n\nCereal Com is and always will be free! I am always willing to add features and improve on the app, just send me a message using the Chrome Web Store."
