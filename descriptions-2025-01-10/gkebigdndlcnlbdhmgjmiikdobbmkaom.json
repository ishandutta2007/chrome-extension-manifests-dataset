Now you can auto-login using the TeamsID extension by hitting the login button\n\nTeamsID enables you to make sharing passwords easy and safe for everyone in your business or organization.\n\nTeamsID provides a flexible and powerful way to make sure all the right people have access to all those bits of information -- passwords, account numbers, codes, or other sensitive records -- that they need to get things done. If someone makes a change to a password or other record, itâ€™s automatically shared with others who need it.\n\nSo with TeamsID, everyone is up to date and there is no need to send bits and pieces of confidential information like passwords over email, IM, or voice mail.\n\nGetting started is easy - create an organization, set up appropriate teams, and then invite members into those teams. \n\nThen, anyone in a team can start creating records and making them available to others. You can also create confidential records that only you have access to.\n\nWith everyone using TeamsID, your organization is more secure, team members spend less time looking for information, and everyone gets more work done."
