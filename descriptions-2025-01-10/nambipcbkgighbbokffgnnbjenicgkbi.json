You just want to block the algorithm-recommended feed!\n\nFor example, on Reddit, I want to be able to see individual posts so that I can get good answers to Google searches. But I don't want to ever see the homepage or subreddit pages, because those are a never-ending feed of content which is extremely addictive to me.\n\nRight now, this works on Reddit and Youtube. I'll add more sites as needed!"
