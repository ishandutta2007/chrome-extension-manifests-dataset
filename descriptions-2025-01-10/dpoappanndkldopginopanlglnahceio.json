This functionality is already implemented and can be tested for free. The delay is about 5 seconds.\n\nCurrently, you can speak without knowing the language, if both the user and their interlocutor have the extension installed. When we have a full-fledged application, we'll be able to capture the user's voice and translate it. So, if you have our app, you can communicate with anyone."
