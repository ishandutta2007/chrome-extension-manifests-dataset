Install this extension on Chrome\n2. Go to Mint.com and log in\n3. Enjoy :)\n\n***IMPORTANT*** - All of the data STAYS on your computer.  No data, money, or anything is sent or transferred anywhere!\n\n\nWealth Dashboard is the best way to get a high level overview of your personal wealth.  Built on top of Mint.com, the dashboard shows you a simple overview of your net worth broken down into a few categories: cash, investments, loans, and property. In addition it shows you your financial growth over time in a simple and intuitive way.\n\nWealth Dashboard is built around the principles of psychology I learned from incredibly successful people: focus on how much wealth you have and how it is growing (instead of just seing a list of things you spent on).\n\nWealth Dashboard is 100% safe for your Mint account and your finances (it doesn't let anyone else see your data and everything is stored on your own computer) and doesn't edit your financial info on Mint at all.\n\nHope you enjoy it and prosper:)\n\nNikil\nwww.nikilster.com/fun.html#wealthdashboard"
