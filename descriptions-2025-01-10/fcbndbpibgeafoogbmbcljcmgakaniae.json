Designed for efficiency and ease of use, Storage Area Viewer provides a comprehensive solution to view and manage local, sync, session, and managed storage areas directly from your browser.\n\n🚀Motivation:\nDue to the transition to Manifest V3, extensions are increasingly moving from localStorage to the Chrome Storage Area. However, there is no easy way for developers to inspect the Storage Area directly in the development tools. Inspired by the Storage Area Explorer and enriched with features commonly needed in development, I created this extension, Storage Area Viewer, to fill that gap.\n\n🖥 Intuitive Modal Design: \nExperience a seamless interface that brings advanced storage management to your fingertips. The modal design ensures a clutter-free environment, allowing you to focus on the data that matters.\n\n👥 User-Friendly Features:\n\n   🔍 Search Capability: \n   Quickly find the data you need with our powerful search function, saving your \n    time and effort.\n\n    📊 Structured JSON View: \n    Navigate through your JSON data with ease, thanks to our structured view that \n    organizes information logically.\n\n    💻 Monaco Editor Integration: \n    Enjoy the same editing experience as Visual Studio Code with the embedded \n    Monaco Editor, making data modification both simple and efficient.\n\n    🔄 Storage Change Tracking: \n    Keep an eye on storage modifications with real-time tracking, ensuring you're \n    always informed of the latest changes.\n\n    🌙 Dark Mode Support: \n    Protect your eyes with our dark mode feature, providing a comfortable viewing \n    experience during both day and night."
