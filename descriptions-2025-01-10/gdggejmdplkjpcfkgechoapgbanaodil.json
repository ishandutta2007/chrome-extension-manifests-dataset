It injects some utility functions into the user interface which allows for the client-side changing of grades, viewing of the grade's weight to your overall in the class, and even provides a grade minimum calculator built in.\n\nThis is to facilitate viewing of grades on skyward, and making some calculations to see what your overall grade would be if it was a different value, or for seeing how much you need to change a grade by in order for your overall to reach a certain goal."
