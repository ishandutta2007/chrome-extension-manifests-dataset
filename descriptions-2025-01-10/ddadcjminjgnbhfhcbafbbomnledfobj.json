Each option may be enabled or disabled at the user's discretion.\n\n- File Cabinet Folder Permalink - This option updates all File Cabinet Folder Links to Permalinks, allowing the user to refresh the page, navigate forward/backward in the browser, copy the current directory URL, and open directory links in new tabs/windows.\n\n- Shift-Click to Copy Field Internal ID - This option provides administrators/developers a much faster method to copy Field Internal ID strings compared to clicking the label, highlighting the ID, copying, and then closing the help panel.\n\n- Disable Locked Customization Message - Hovering over a locked customization opens the following message \"The bundle author has locked this object to prevent editing.\" This message cannot be closed by the user and is especially annoying when looking at SuiteBundles or SuiteApps with many customizations. This option disables the message from appearing.\n\n- Press Escape to Close Panels - The native NetSuite interface requires the Help Modal to be focused to close it by pressing Escape. This setting generalizes closing the panel even if it is not in focus. Also works on the Personalize Dashboard panel.\n\nAuthor's Note 1: \nPlease reach out to me on the NetSuite Professionals Slack to submit bugs or request new features.\n\nAuthor's Note 2:\nYou may need to un-check and re-check each option for them to take effect. I'm looking into why this happens."
