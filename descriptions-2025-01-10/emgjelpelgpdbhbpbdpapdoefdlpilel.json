Developed with all languages in mind, but tested in German. Works on both exercises and skills. Does not interfere with stories. No effect on performance as it only uses CSS. Works with all devices. \n\nIf the extension is not working/their cartoon images are loading as well, please refresh the page you are on before reporting a bug to WenLiProgramming [at] gmail.com"
