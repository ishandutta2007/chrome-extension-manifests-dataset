Many caveats, including:\n- It's a screen scraping app, so highly dependent on the specific HTML structure for the page. All bets are off if Coursera or the PL course changes any of this.\n- Only the stundent functions which match sample functions are placed adjacent the samples. The rest of the student file, with some reordering, is placed in a new element at the end of the page."
