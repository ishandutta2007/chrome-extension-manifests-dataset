It periodically fetches sensor data from an API and updates the extension's icon to reflect the current sensor level. The icon represents different states based on the salt level detected by the sensor: high, medium, or low.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\nReal-time Icon Updates: The extension fetches sensor data every minute and updates the extension icon to show the current status. The icon changes depending on the salt level: high (below 8 inches), medium (8-12 inches), or low (above 12 inches).\n\nAPI Health Monitoring: Before fetching data, the extension checks the health of the connected API. If the API is down, the extension will show an error icon.\n\nTimestamp Validation: The extension ensures the sensor data timestamp is valid and within the last two minutes. If the timestamp is outdated, a warning icon will be displayed.\n\nPeriodic Refresh: The extension sets up an alarm that triggers every minute, fetching fresh data and updating the icon accordingly.\n\n\nThe extension is ideal for monitoring systems where real-time updates on salt levels or similar metrics are required. The icon's dynamic state helps users easily understand the system's current status without having to open the extension.\n\n--\n\nIcons by Icon8 (https://icons8.com/) is licensed under Creative Commons BY 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)."
