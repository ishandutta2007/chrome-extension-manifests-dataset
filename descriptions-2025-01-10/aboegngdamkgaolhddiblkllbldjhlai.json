From SEO to blog writing and even development support. There's thousands of prompts to choose from, all well organized and searchable.\n\n⭐️ For the full list of features and capabilities:\n      https://promptden.com/forge\n\n⭐️ For the latest release notes:\n      https://promptden.com/changelog\n\n⭐️ For support:\n      https://help.promptden.com\n\n➡️ What if another AI platform releases that's better than ChatGPT?\n\nAI is developing at a blistering pace, ChatGPT is all the rage these days but who knows what the future holds? We've built a platform that will outlive any single service and can be integrated into many of them and even ones that haven't been released yet!\n\nWe currently support:\n\n• ChatGPT\n• Gemini (Bard)\n• Claude\n• Midjourney\n\n➡️ What about my data?\n\nPromptForge is built on the same platform as PromptDen.com. So all prompts you create, like, share and collect also live in your profile there. Regardless of the future of ChatGPT or any other AI platform, you'll always have a way to access all of your curated prompts and data.\n\nAs for privacy, any information you share with the community on PromptForge remains yours. We'll never attempt to lock it behind paywalls. Community content is just that, community content. As far as data you store privately (prompts, collections, etc) on our services, that is also yours and only yours.\n\nAt the end of the day we treat our users and their data like we would want to be treated. No selling of any data, gimmicky advertising or bait and switch tactics here. What you see is what you get and we vow to keep it that way.\n\n---\n\nPlease Note:\nPromptForge can conflict with other extensions made for ChatGPT, Bard, Claude and Midjourney. We recommend uninstalling or disabling those extensions when using PromptForge."
