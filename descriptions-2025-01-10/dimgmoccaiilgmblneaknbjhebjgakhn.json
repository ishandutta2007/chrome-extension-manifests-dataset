Some users may want to hide these accounts, but they don't want to delete the accounts because deleting the accounts would also delete the historical data.\n\nThis free, lightweight add-on allows users to temporarily hide the inactive accounts without actually deleting them. Simply navigate to mint.com/settings, click this extension, and the inactive accounts will be hidden until you refresh/revisit the page. This extension is about 50 lines of Javascript that simply traverses the html elements and sets the relevant elements to 'display: none'. \n\nThis extension was quickly created for personal use and I figured I may as well share it with the public. There is no data collection or any other form of monetization.\nThat being said, there is no funding or guaranteed support for this basic extension.\nUnless it's adopted, upgraded, or maintained, this extension may be temporarily ineffective in the future if Mint changes their class names or ids for their elements."
