It allows users to spawn other snakes on the map they are playing on and control these snakes movement to form various patterns such as a tornado pattern or a rain pattern. SnakeyRain's main goal is to harbor a positive user experience for all slither.io players, including those who are not using the extension and those who prefer to play in a server without it. With this in mind, SnakeyRain is limited to servers that are not regularly populated with players. There is player count limiter in place which ensures there is always room in the server for others to join. The developers of SnakeyRain are active members of the slither.io community and we take pride in offering a user experience that is enjoyable for all.\n\nQuick Setup:\n\n1. Install both SnakeyRain and NTL mod from the Chrome Webstore.\n2. Navigate to slither.io and press the login button at the top of the screen.\n3. Join a server and press the Start/Stop Bots key (= by default) to start spawning bots. Some commonly used servers are banned from use and bots will not spawn there."
