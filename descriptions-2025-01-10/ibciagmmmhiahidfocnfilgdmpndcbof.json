This also aggregates time present on all the cards which fall under a group(Groups present by default on planner by default are Bucket, Assigned to, Progress, Due date, Labels , Priority ). \n\nPURPOSE : \nSince there is no default way provided by Microsoft planner to provide the estimated time , remaining time and actual invested time it took by each card (work) , you can use this extension to provide these time in heading of the cards and then analyze the work completed in hours.\n\nHOW TO USE :\nThis plugin supports 3 brackets (...), {...} and [...] in which you can provide hours. These brackets are expected to be populated on the heading of the cards. Then you can assign what you want each of the brackets to denote.\nFor Example : \n# let the [ ... ] denote the estimated time it will take to finish the task\n# let the ( ... ) denote the remaining time it will take to finish the task\n# let the { ... } denote the actual time it took to finish the task or what you have already invested"
