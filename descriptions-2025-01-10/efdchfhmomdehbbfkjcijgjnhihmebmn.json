Does your battery percentage reduce in front of your very eyes?\n\nUse Tab Freezer to freeze tabs so they do not consume memory or cpu, enabling longer battery life and better performance. You get to keep all your window and tab organizations as is, not having to manage bookmarks or links, and can easily get back to paused work."
