If you want additional functionality, please take a look at https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/super-tab-sorter/jjhppbooocacaccnhjninhmigbfmpnkh instead.\n\nThanks!\nPeter\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE INSTALLING AND SUBMITTING NEGATIVE REVIEWS:\n\n1. Simple Tab Sorter v0.4.0 and later require Chrome version 88 or later. If you're using an older version of Chrome, you can manually install v0.3.3 by following the instructions at https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter#install-as-an-extension-from-source .\n\n2. \"Read your browsing history\" permission warning during install in versions 0.4.0 and later...\n\nChrome changed the permissions message for \"tabs\" permissions for manifest v3 extensions. The new release (0.4.0) isn't doing anything with the tabs API that it wasn't doing before - i.e., it doesn't have access to your browser history, just the currently open tab URLs which are required to sort by URL.\n\nYou can see the requested permissions for this extension at https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter/blob/master/src/manifest.json. The developer documentation for the \"tabs\" API (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs) states:\n\n\"The \"tabs\" permission\nThis permission does not give access to the chrome.tabs namespace. Instead, it grants an extension the ability to call tabs.query() against four sensitive properties on tabs.Tab instances: url, pendingUrl, title, and favIconUrl.\"\n\nAs you'll see, there is NO mention of \"history\" anywhere in the \"chrome.tabs\" developer documentation. To have access to your browsing history, an extension would have to specify \"history\" in the manifest.json permissions, which you can verify this doesn't, as documented at https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/history.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2024-01-04: Version 0.4.1 released\n* Fixed sort all windows bug resulting from conversion to manifest v3\n\n2023-12-19: Version 0.4.0 released\n* Converted to Chrome manifest v3\n* Added support for Chrome's Tab Groups\n\n2023-04-25: Version 0.3.3 released\n* Fixed https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter/issues/21 - now compatible with Chrome's new suspended tabs.\n\n2021-07-14: Version 0.3.2 released\n* Fixed https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter/issues/8 - sorting now *ignores* tabs in tab groups.\n* Sort by URL now ignores leading \"www.\" of URLs if present\nChanges viewable at https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter/pull/14\n\n2021-02-21: Version 0.3.1 released\n* Removed Google Analytics code\n* Added support for extensions derived from The Great Suspender now that it's been removed from the Chrome Web Store and derivative works have been submitted.\nChanges viewable at https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter/pull/12\n\n2020-06-29: Version 0.3.0 released\n* Added \"Sort pinned tabs\" option and disabled it by default\n* Added short form to collect user feedback when extension is removed"
