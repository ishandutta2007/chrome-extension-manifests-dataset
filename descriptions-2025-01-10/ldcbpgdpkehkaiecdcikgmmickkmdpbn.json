This piece explores trust in our shared connection with one another—across time, space, and difference.\n\nShyama Kuver’s artistic practice is inspired by her queer and Indo-Fijian identities, a deep love for nature, and growing up in pre-tech San Francisco. She is a community and self-taught artist living in Washington, D.C. During the day, she works in education, creating access and equitable infrastructures for students who are parenting, system-impacted, and/or are returning to pursue their undergraduate degree as adults. At night, she likes to explore new and old worlds through her artistic practice."
