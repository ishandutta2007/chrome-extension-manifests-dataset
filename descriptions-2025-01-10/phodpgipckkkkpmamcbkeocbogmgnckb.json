The extension performs an in-depth analysis of several critical SEO elements, with a particular focus on noindex directives and canonical tags.\n\nAt the core of its functionality is the ability to examine multiple layers of a webpage:\n\nDOM (Document Object Model): The extension scans both the <head> section and the entire HTML structure of the loaded page. This captures both static and dynamically injected meta tags.\n\nHTTP Headers: It analyzes server response headers for X-Robots-Tag directives, which is crucial for detecting server-side noindex instructions.\n\nRaw HTML Source: The extension inspects the raw HTML, including both the <head> section and the entire document. This can reveal tags that may not have been interpreted within the DOM.\n\nFor noindex directives, the extension specifically checks:\n\nMeta robots tags in both the DOM and the raw HTML source.\nX-Robots-Tag in HTTP headers.\nFor canonical tags, it inspects:\n\nLink tags with rel=\"canonical\" in both the DOM and the raw HTML source.\nLink headers with rel=\"canonical\" in the HTTP response.\nThe extension distinguishes between internal and external canonical URLs, which is vital for assessing a page’s indexability.\n\nBased on these comprehensive checks, \"Will it Index\" provides a clear answer on whether a page is likely to be indexed by search engines. A page is considered indexable if:\n\nNo noindex directives are found.\nThere is no external canonical URL.\nThe server's status code is within the 200-series (indicating a successful response).\nThe extension’s user interface presents this information in a clear and structured manner, with color-coded indicators for quick visual feedback. For canonical URLs, it includes a clickable icon, allowing easy access to inspect the canonical destination.\n\n\"Will it Index\" is an indispensable tool for anyone working with web optimization and SEO. By providing instant, comprehensive analysis of a page’s indexability, it saves time and reduces the risk of overlooking critical SEO issues. Whether you're conducting a thorough SEO audit, troubleshooting indexing problems, or simply double-checking a single page’s status, \"Will it Index\" is designed to be your go-to solution for quick and reliable indexability analysis."
