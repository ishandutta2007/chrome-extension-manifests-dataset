The Alice Keeler AnyoneCanView Chrome extension helps you with this problem. When creating a Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides or Google Drawing the default sharing setting is private. Changing the viewing permissions requires multiple clicks. Instead, click the AnyoneCanView Chrome extension to instantly change the sharing permissions to \"Anyone with the link can view.\" This will open the viewing permissions to those outside of your domain or school. The link to the Google Doc is also automatically copied to your clipboard. This saves you from the extra step of copying the URL after you changed the sharing permissions. Simply paste (Control V) the link where you want to share the document and have full confidence that others can view the document. See my other Chrome extensions at http://alicekeeler.com/webstore"
