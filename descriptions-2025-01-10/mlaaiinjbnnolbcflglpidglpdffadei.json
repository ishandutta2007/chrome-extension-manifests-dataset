There's little overlap, but at this team size, it doesn't make sense to have separate workflows and work management tools. In order to help get our non-technical (operations) team members onto pivotal, this plugin replaces terms familiar to developers with analogous ops terms. This is the first pass at this idea, so not sure if I recommend it but feel free to borrow, replicate, distribute, and modify, license enclosed. \n\nHow it works: We're replacing the story types of feature, bug, chore, and release with the analogous types of stories outside of the software development (as we see it in our context): Feature --> Initiative or project work, Bug --> Unplanned but important iteration or last minute client request, Chore --> Chore or operational BAU (Business as Usual), and Release --> Milestone or Release. We've also changed \"Epics\" to \"Initiatives (Epics)\".\n\nThe main value will be to be able to track metrics across all teams, software, operational, and others to see overall progress, productivity metrics, etc."
