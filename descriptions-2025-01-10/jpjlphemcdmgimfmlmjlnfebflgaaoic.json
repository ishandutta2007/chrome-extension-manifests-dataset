It searches through your existing players to find a solution, and if none is available, it tries to build a squad using concept players.\n\nSupported Features:\n\n- Solves all SBCs except Foundations (for now).\n- Uses only common and rare untradeable players by default, as low rated as possible.\n- Works entirely in your web browser, no connection to a server needed.\n- Supports mobile and desktop browsers.\n\nHow to Use AutoSBC:\n\n1. Open the SBC you want to complete in the browser.\n2. Click the \"Fire\" button in the top left corner.\n3. Set your desired criteria, including the rating combination if needed.\n4. Click \"Build\" to launch the solver.\n5. Review the suggested players and submit the SBC.\n\nImportant Note: Completing too many SBCs in a short period can lead to a temporary ban from doing SBCs on the website. If this happens, you can still complete SBCs directly in the game or in the companion application. You'll just need to wait a few hours before being allowed again."
