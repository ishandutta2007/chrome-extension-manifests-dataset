You can use the ID to create a link to that section, but finding the ID usually means viewing the source code for the page, finding the header element for the section you want, and appending the ID to the URL before sharing it.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that hard.\n\nCREATING LINKS AUTOMATICALLY\n\nThis extension scans the page and generates links for all headers on the page, assuming they have an ID or Name assigned.\n\n- Hover over any header, and an anchor link will appear.\n\n- Click on the \"chain\" icon to copy the link to your clipboard.\n\nIf there's no ID or Name in the header tag, it will search any elements nested inside the header tag for the first one with an ID or Name assigned. Failing that, it looks at the immediate parent element (i.e. a header nested in a DIV). If it still finds nothing, then no link will be generated or shown.\n\nREQUIRED PERMISSIONS\n\nIt'll ask you for permission to read and modify all pages, because that's what it does. It scans the page for headers with IDs (or Names), and then injects one link for each header that has it present.\n\nNEED HELP?\n\nIf you need help, have a comment or suggestion, or just want to see the code for yourself, visit the GitHub repo where the source code is hosted. You can open an issue by clicking the \"Issues\" tab at the top.\n\nhttps://github.com/grantwinney/generate-links-for-headers-in-chrome\n\nWANT TO LEARN MORE?\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Chrome extension, but aren't sure where to start, check out this brief tutorial:\n\nhttps://grantwinney.com/making-your-first-chrome-extension"
