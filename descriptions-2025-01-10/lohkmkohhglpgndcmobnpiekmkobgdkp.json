Now, Google automatically sets new keywords as \"Broad\" match, and if you want \"Exact\" or \"Phrase\" match, you have to add extra symbols manually each time, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nOur Google Ads extension addresses this issue. It allows you to:\n→ Choose the match type for each keyword individually when adding matched search terms.\n→ Change the match type for all matched terms in bulk before adding them.\n\nThis makes the process faster and reduces the likelihood of mistakes. \n\nOur extension works on your device and does not send your data to external servers or third parties.\n\n░░░ Change Log: ░░░\nv1.0.13\n• Minor bug fix to address multiple \" and [ syntax which could occur\n\nv1.0.12\n• Extension name change to better represent the broader capabilities recently added\n• Adjustments to improve activation of extension under different conditions\n\nv1.0.11\n• Minor UI fixes\n• Changed extension activation method to address issue reported by some users\n\nv1.0.10 \n• Extended match type switcher from \"matched terms\" screens to core \"add keyword/negative keyword\" screens to enable quick match type switching everywhere\n• Revised UI with buttons for improved UX\n• Added links to Privacy Policy, Support Center, Reviews and Social Sharing\n\nv1.0.6\n• First release"
