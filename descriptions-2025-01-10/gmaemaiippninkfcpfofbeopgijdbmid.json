Sure, you could temporarily turn the block off, but then what are the chances that you'll turn it back on again?\n\nWith Chill, no site is permanently blocked. You can still get access to these sites... only if you have a reason. To get access to a blocked site, Chill allows you to send a request (with a reason) to your future self, with the amount of wait time proportional to the amount of time you've requested to spend on the site. This pause gives you time to stop and reflect, leaving behind your impulses and turning back to rational thought. \n\nIdeas? Suggestions? Email erxu@ctemc.org"
