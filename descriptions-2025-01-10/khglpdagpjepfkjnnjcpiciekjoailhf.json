The extension will automatically select all files in the torrent and start it.\n\nOnce complete you can download the contained files using chrome, or you can copy the completed links from the popup window for use with external software.\n\nBy default, the torrents are removed on completion but this can be changed via settings.\n\nIf using chrome to download each torrent will have its own folder in your \"downloads\\rddm\".\n\nI look forward to any feedback and hope people find this extension useful.\n\nUpdates:\n05/06/2020\n- Removed unused permissions (for planned features which weren't implemented) to comply with Googles policies."
