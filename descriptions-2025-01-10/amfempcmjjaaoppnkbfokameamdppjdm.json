Those with an X have not reached this standard and an alternative brand is recommended. If no pop-up appears (not-rated), it means that more data is needed to make an assessment. Certified brands have taken an extra step to make a long-term commitment towards gender equality and diversity.\n\nOnce you click on the Gender Fair rating, you can tweet to thank (or encourage) a company on its efforts and learn more about Gender Fair and what it takes to support women in the workplace."
