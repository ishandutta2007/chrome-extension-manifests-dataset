From there, you can click and drag how you felt about a specific day on top of its respective date. Click on the smiley again to make all the emojis on the screen disappear. Additionally, click on the left and right arrows at the top of the calendar to switch between months. If you dragged the wrong emoji, don't worry! Just drag it to the bottom of the screen and it'll disappear. There are two more buttons at the bottom of the screen. The restore button will reposition all the emojis you had from the last session, and double clicking the reset button will get rid of all the emojis you've dragged thus far. Click on any date to bring up a notes section, where you can jot down whatever you want. The paint icon will bring up a color palette where you can customize the colors to your liking. I hope you enjoy using it!"
