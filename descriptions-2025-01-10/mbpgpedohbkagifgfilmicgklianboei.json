If you have enjoyed using Buttonless don’t forget to tell your friends, rate ★★★★★ or make a donation of £1, £2, £5 or whatever you can afford in the link below. With your help, we can keep the extension development going and push it much further.\n\nhttp://paypal.me/chendesigns/5\n\n\n0.0.0.11 (14/04/16)\n\nThe past several weeks has been horrible for Buttonless. With our one and only developer decided to disappear, decreasing number of users...everything seems to be turning south. Here's a brief summary so far.\n\nUPDATES\n0 Developers on board\n0 Donations since launch\n0 Bugs fixed\n0 People smiling right now\n\nNothing really special in 0.0.0.11 apart from the number. Yeah, we're doomed. But it's not the end...(or is it?) i'm joking it's not...(but am i?)...yes i confirm, this version is to show I haven't forgotten about all the existing Buttonless users.\n\n\nFOLLOW US\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/ButtonlessRocks\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVku3VsakeQDQWuL-02Z2Kg\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Buttonless-226779497665156"
