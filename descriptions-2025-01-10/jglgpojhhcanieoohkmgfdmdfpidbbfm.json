If you visit an article out on the web and that article has been catalogued on Idealogs and annotated by our community, then this extension will allow you to see those annotations directly when viewing the article itself, wherever it is hosted.\n\nThese annotations are links to articles on idealogs.org which ask questions, summarize answers, prove claims, cite other primary sources, and provide encyclopedic information about subjects relevant to the article. All annotations are meant to help give you context and a greater understanding of the subject at hand."
