Display a Timer on Google Meet calls. Use it in two modes: Manual (enter time duration manually) or Automatic (connect your Google Calendar and enjoy an automatic timer on all matched calls).\n\nThe timer counts the time down automatically, shows visually the meeting progress and warns you when the call is about to end. The Google Meet Timer will also inform you about the halftime and overtime points.\n\n\nCore Features:\n\nüïí Automatic Timer - when Google Calendar is connected and the event is matched\n‚è∞ Manual Timer - when Google Calendar is not connected or the event is not matched\nü§ù Share Timer for other participants\nüåà Visually display the progress of the meeting as well as halftime and overtime points\nü§å Drag & Drop\nüö® Be notified about overlapping meetings inside the Timer\nüìç Favicon Badge - see the upcoming meeting on the extension's icon\nüîä Sound alerts (optional) - you can enable sound alerts when the meeting is about to finish or it's an overtime\nüìÖ List upcoming Google Calendar events in the extension's popup\n\n\nManual Timer:\n\n- Counts time up, until you set the duration\n- When you set the duration, you will see the progress, halftime and overtime points\n- The time will be preserved after the page is refreshed\n- You can configure the default duration time in Settings\n\nAutomatic Timer:\n\n1. Connect your Google Calendar account\n2. The Timer will count down the time automatically for all Google Meet calls which matches your Google Calendar events\n\n\nDetailed information:\n\nüïí Google Meet Timer\nThe Timer will be displayed automatically on every Google Meet call when a corresponding Google Calendar event is detected. You don't have to set the timer limits manually for every call. You sign in to your Google Account once and enjoy having Google Meet calls empowered by a countdown Timer.\n\n‚è≥ Countdown time in Google Meet calls\nAll other Timer's Chrome Extensions can only count time up or force you to define time manually every time you join the meeting. Meeting Timer for Google Meet counts time down, as does it automatically.\n\nüåà Visual time progress for Google Meet call\nBecause the Meeting Timer for Google Meet is based on real calendar events, it can precisely visually show the current progress of the meeting. It will also visually warn you when the meeting is about to finish, so you can start wrapping up your speech. Additionally, you will see the halftime and overtime points.\n\nü§ù Share Google Meet Timer for other participants\nProductivity is key. Being able to manage meeting Time is a difficult task. But it's much easier when you see the progress of the meeting and even easier when you can share this progress with everyone on the call. Meeting Timer for Google Meet allows you to share the Timer to all open Tabs, so whenever you share the screen, Timer is visible to others.\n\nüö® Detect overlapping meetings inside Timer\nWe all know how often you miss the meeting or you are late, because it starts just after the meeting you're currently in. Or in a worst-case scenario, it starts during your meeting. Meeting Timer for Google Meet can detect such moments and inform you about them inside a Google Meet Timer! And it will do it in a visually noticeable way so you won't miss it.\n\nüìÖ List upcoming Google Calendar events\nMeeting Timer for Google Meet is not only a Google Meet call Timer. It has a simple yet powerful integration with Google Calendar, so you can easily see upcoming meetings, directly from your browser. Yes, by clicking the extension icon you get access to 3 upcoming meetings. You can join them, copy a Google Meet call link or even accept or decline an invitation to the event.\n\n‚è∞ Favicon Alert Badge\nA small yet very useful feature we decided to add is a small, red badge on the extension icon. It will be displayed just before the meeting starts and will show how many minutes have left before the meeting begins. Believe us, you will appreciate it sooner than later :).\n\nüåê Security notes\nWe don't store any data on our servers.
