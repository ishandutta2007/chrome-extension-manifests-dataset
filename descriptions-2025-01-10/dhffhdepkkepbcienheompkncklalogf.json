Get paid for it.\n\nAI is the most powerful technology of all time, and now you can earn a stake in its development!\n\nVoltix is a network of over 2 million people that helps developers train artificial intelligence. Once you install the Lite Node, it runs in the background of your computer and uses small amounts of unused CPU power to process AI training data.
