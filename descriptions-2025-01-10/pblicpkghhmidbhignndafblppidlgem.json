The objective is to strategically combine the animals to merge them into larger and more impressive creatures. For example, two mice will transform into a yellow chicken, and multiple chickens can be merged into a mighty crab. The ultimate goal is to keep combining the animals until you reach the majestic whale! Players must think carefully to maximize the size of their animal combinations. Can you grow your collection all the way up to the enormous whale? Zooplop offers an addictive and charming gameplay experience that can be enjoyed for free at the website https://classroom-6x.org/.\n\n*Note:We have added \"Classroom 6x, Poki unblocked\" button, making it easy for players to quickly access the games on our website! https://classroom-6x.org/, https://poki.ee/"
