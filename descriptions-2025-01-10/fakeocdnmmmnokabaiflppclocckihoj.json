Check for and optionally remove empty folders, duplicate bookmarks, and similar bookmarks. View and optionally clear your bookmark history.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nSprucemarks can be used alongside other bookmark extensions but you must be careful that both extensions do not try to sort the same areas. Each extension may have its own sorting logic which may lead to endless sorting as each extension reacts to changes by the other.\n\nPRIVACY\n\nSprucemarks respects your privacy.\nhttps://nightmode.fm/software/sprucemarks/privacy\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis software is provided under a no-contact and no-support model.
