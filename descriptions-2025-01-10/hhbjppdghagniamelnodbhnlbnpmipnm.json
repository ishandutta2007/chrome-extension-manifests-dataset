Ever see your computer slow down or hear the fans start spinning?\n\nSimply click the Radio icon in the YouTube player to remove the video. If you are playing a playlist, every video will be blanked out automatically.\n\n* This only works with the HTML5 YouTube player. Videos that are forced to play in Flash, such as VEVO, will not work with the plugin.\n* This does not save on bandwidth, just CPU usage and potential distractions.\n\nUsage based on a single video playing. CPU usage reduced by ~50%.\n\nYouTube is a trademark of Google Inc. Use of this trademark is subject to Google Permissions."
