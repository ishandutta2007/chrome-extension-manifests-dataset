Data teams at Bose, ClickUp, Klaviyo, and more use our data observability platform to prevent and detect data issues—before the CEO pings them about weird revenue numbers.\n\nWe do this with ML-based anomaly detection, end-to-end column-level lineage, and tools to help prevent incidents before they occur.
