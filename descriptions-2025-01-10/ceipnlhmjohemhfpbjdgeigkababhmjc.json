It won't click twice within 7 seconds however.\n\nIf the popup box appears too often after a circle then it means your IP address/network seems to be spammy to Google. This extension has no role about how often this popup comes asking you select number plates/driving marks/shops/water etc.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n\nThis does not store, save or transmit any information in/out of your computer. It is 100% safe and completely free to use.\n\nPlease send us improvement suggestions."
