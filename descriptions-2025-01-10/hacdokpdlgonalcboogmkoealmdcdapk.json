This helps save time for CA and Tax professionals  while accessing tax portals.\n\nThis tool auto fills your clients credentials from a dropdown where you can choose from. You can add,edit and update the credentials from the dashboard. Not just this ,you can as well, tag or share these credentials to your employees and can have complete control over the password updates and visibility.\nYou can choose for a suitable subscription from our pricing category on our website https://keycrypt.in/\nThis extension provides you with an unique plugin through which you can enter into any central or state tax websites like IT PAN,GST,E WAYBILL,IT TAN,TDS TAN,SHRAM SUVIDHA,ESIC,EPFO,IEC,MSME, PT,LABOUR etc, without even having to open the dashboard.\nAny password changes will be updated and remembered, not just this but as an admin you will be notified about any such change.\n\nNote: If an unsaved account is logged in into any tax site,our extension will not remember those credentials to avoid notifications and unnecessary saving of third party login credentials. However, we would recommend you to always enter the client’s mobile number which is registered in the tax portal for future integrations."
