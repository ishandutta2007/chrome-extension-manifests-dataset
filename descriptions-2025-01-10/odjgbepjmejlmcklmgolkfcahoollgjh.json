For search results up to 400, you only need to wait up to 30 seconds for the automatic download. Keep the side panel open to avoid interrupting the process!\n2. For results over 400, you only need to wait up to 5 minutes. You can close the side panel and a download link will magically appear when ready.\n\nYour feedback is very valuable to me. Email me with any suggestions/improvements you have in mind!"
