The benefits of that are:\n- It is significantly cheaper\n- There is no filtration layer, so it is less censored & possibly slightly smarter\n- The generation speed can be faster\n- There is less rate limiting, if any\n- You can alter the system prompt, temperature, and other variables.\n\nHowever, for casual use (or for more than occasional testing), it is a bit rough. That's the goal of this extension: to improve the experience & polish some of the rough edges.\n\n‚ùáÔ∏è Features:\n- Markdown for A.I. messages\n- Code highlighting & copy-on-click\n- Automatically refocus input textbox & restore cursor position on page refocus - (very handy when creating a prompt and switching back and forth between windows)\n- Default system prompt \n- Decreased system prompt div width (more free real estate for messages)\n- More in the future\n\nüõ°Ô∏è How to use:\nThe extension will automatically run in the background when you use the playground. You do not need to turn it on manually.\n\nüî® Info:\nThere is a lot of room for other useful features, such as configurable defaults (system prompt, temperature, model...), UI, unblocking scroll lock etc. If you are a developer and want to contribute, you are more than welcome to make a PR https://github.com/AspireOne/playground-thing.\n\nNote: There is a possibility of bugs and if OpenAI changes the Playground page significantly, it might break until updated."
