This will speed up your development cycle by facilitating the creation of unit and integration tests.\n\nGetting Started\nClick 'Add to Chrome'. That's it! Once you see our icon at the upper-right of your browser window, you are ready to start generating Cypress scripts.\n\nFeatures\nThis extension will allow you to:\n* Record clicks, typing, submits, and navigation in the browser.\n* See the scripts render live as they are generated.\n* Delete accidental actions.\n* Reorder actions as necessary.\n* Pause and resume recording within a single session.\n* Record navigation within a domain.\n* Copy the generated code to your clipboard.\n\nUsage\n* Open the extension and click 'Start Recording' to begin recording actions.\n* Click links, submit forms, etc.\n* Check your saved actions by opening the popup at any time.\n* Click 'Stop Recording' to stop recording. From there, you will have the option to resume recording, reset, or copy your generated code to your clipboard.\n* You can also use keyboard shortcuts: \n    On Macs:\n    - ctrl + R to start and stop recording\n    - ctrl + G to reset\n    On PCs and Linux:\n    - alt + R to start and stop recording\n    - alt + G to reset\n\nAuthors\nAbbey Campbell | https://github.com/abbeycampbell\nBradley Morgan | https://github.com/bkmorgan3\nKen Sakuma | https://github.com/gxcad\nAdam Stover | https://github.com/adam-stover\n\nWe welcome contributions to this project!
