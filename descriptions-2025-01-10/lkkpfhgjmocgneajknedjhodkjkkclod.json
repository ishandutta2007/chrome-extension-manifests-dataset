Unfortunately, this means that my extension will no longer work since it hasn't been updated to meet the requirements of manifest v3.\n\nAfter giving it some thought, I've decided not to invest any more time in developing Chrome extensions. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, and I appreciate your trust in using my extension.\n\nThank you for your understanding and support.\n\nCheers,\n\nSander\n***\n\n\n\nTake a quick look at on-page SEO factors of the page you visit in the browser. \n\nSEO Peek is a Chrome extension that checks the Document Object Model (DOM) of a page. There is no need to view the HTML source or inspect the DOM in the elements tab of Chrome DevTools.\n\nSEO Peek checks the most relevant content elements and robot directives inside the DOM of both traditional server-side generated pages and client-side rendered pages like Single Page Applications (SPA).\n\nBesides a check of HTML elements the extension also sends a request to the server to check the HTTP Status and several HTTP Response Headers like the HTTP Canonical header, X-Robots-Tag header and Vary header.\n\nFor all link elements and link headers the extension checks if the URL of a link element or link header refers to the URL of the current page (self-referential).\n\nThe HTTP status for the canonical URL is also being checked. When the response contains a redirect the extension detects the redirect and shows the response URL and its HTTP status.\n\nThe extension gives you insights into several relevant content elements and robot directives.\n\nContent elements\n- Page title\n- Meta description\n- Meta keywords\n- H1 headings\n\nRobot directives\n- HTTP status\n- Meta robots (Meta robots tag, X-Robots-Tag header)\n- Canonicalization annotations (Canonical link tag, Canonical link header)\n- Pagination annotations (Prev link tag, Next link tag)\n- Mobile annotations (Rel-alternate-media annotation, Vary HTTP header, AMP HTML annotation)\n- International annotations (Rel-alternate-hreflang annotation)"
