The extension is incredibly easy to install and use, even for those with limited technical knowledge. \n\nThis tool has three colors - red, orange, and green - that indicate the status of ChatGPT. These colors change in real-time based on how the service is working.\n\nGreen means that ChatGPT is working well and there are no issues to worry about. This is the best color to see! \n\nOrange means that there may be some issues with ChatGPT, but it's still working. This color suggests that users may want to be cautious, but can still use the service.\n\nRed means that there are significant issues with ChatGPT, and it may not be working properly. If users see this color, they may want to avoid using the service until the problem is resolved."
