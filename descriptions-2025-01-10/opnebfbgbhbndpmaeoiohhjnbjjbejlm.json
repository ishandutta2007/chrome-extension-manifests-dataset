This browser extension quietly replaces the word \"woke\" on any web page with \"treating people with respect.\" The results can be rather hilarious. \n\nGOP denounces new policy as \"treating people with respect.\"   \n\nFlorida introduces the Stop Treating People with Respect Act. \n\nTrump calls out Dems as treating people with respect. \n\nGov. Ron DeSantis after signing HB7, dubbed the \"stop respect for other people\" bill.\n\nNB: You may get a warning that this extension is not trusted by Enhanced Safe Browsing. This is because it changes the contents of webpages. I've published the code on GitHub so you can see precisely what goes on under the hood. All it does is what it says on the tin. \n\nhttps://github.com/Brianfit/woke-respect"
