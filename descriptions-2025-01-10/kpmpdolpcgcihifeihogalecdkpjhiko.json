This tool could be useful to Advocates using this as a regular workflow. At the moment, mapping from YouTube video to Amara page is hard-coded and for new videos this extension must be updated.\n\nLatest update includes opening Amara from YouTube page of a Khan Academy video, but also a reverse action of opening Khan Academy video page from its Amara location. Wherever you are - you'll get to wherever you need to go!"
