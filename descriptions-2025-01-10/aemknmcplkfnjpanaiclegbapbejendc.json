All this code is for free and you can see it here: https://github.com/aadilmallick/new-webblock\n\nFuture features\n- Preventing user from unblocking websites by making them answer a bunch of math questions first. \n- When user tries to uninstall extension, guilt trip users by opening a page that absolutely roasts them.\n- Have a custom page or quote users can redirect to.\n\n\nPatch Notes\n- v1.0.1: made the app actually work\n- v1.0.2: fixed weird flexbox issue with add block site schedule UI\n- v1.0.4: add focus groups\n- v1.0.5: show schedule timing and add url options\n- v1.0.6: add option to block certain sites only in incognito windows\n- v1.0.8: fix permanent block bug"
