Even if you are not logged in, every news article, image, or website you visit from Reddit is being recorded. \n\nI made this because there wasn't any other Chrome extension that would block Reddit link tracking in August, 2016. Although you can turn off tracking in your user preferences, that is only useful if you are logged in. This extension disables tracking even when logged out.\n\nBe aware that this only stops Reddit's outbound link tracking. This should be used in combination with other extensions that block other types of tracking.\n\n* HTTP Everywhere - Always view Reddit on https://\n* Privacy Badger - Block more trackers\n* Adblock - Block even more trackers"
