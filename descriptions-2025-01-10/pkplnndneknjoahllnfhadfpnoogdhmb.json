In other viewer bot services, after purchasing the viewer bot, you need to purchase total views to close the statistical difference. Otherwise, twitch will notice the bots. As the ViewerApps Developer team, we have developed artificial-intelligence for bots to act as organic viewers. Twitch bot viewers join your channel gradually at certain intervals, and these participations do not appear as Bot Traffic in the twitch logs. An average of 75 viewers is only a prerequisite for being a partner on Twitch. There are more than 10 criteria to become a partner. One of our users' misconceptions is that the partnership will be opened automatically when only 75 viewers complete their target. Sorry but unfortunately it is not that easy. Partnership is a different process than being an “Affiliate”. For detailed information on this topic, you can find a guide on the User Forum."
