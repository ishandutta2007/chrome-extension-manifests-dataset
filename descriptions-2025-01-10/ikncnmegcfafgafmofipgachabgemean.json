Having the ability to save and more importantly find the information you want is priceless. Bookmark!t offers superior organisation, giving you the ability to save, tag, and search through your bookmarks, so you’ll never lose that important information again. Don’t waste time searching for information you have already found, bookmarkit, does the hard work for you.\n\n⋆ Collections - Organize your bookmarks by using collections, similar to folders. Create new collections to keep your research, inspiration, new finds etc structured through labels and colors.\n\n⋆ Tagging - Create tags like keywords to give your bookmarks more context. Tagging makes it easy to find content and related websites fast.\n\n⋆ Reminders - Set a reminder when saving a bookmark to get notified via email and push notifications at your preferred date and time.\n\n⋆ Import, Share and Protect - Edit your collections, share with others or protect them with a password. You can also save all open tabs at once into a new collection.\n\n⋆ Advanced Search - Bookmarkits advanced search algorithm allows you to find your saved items not only at lightening speeds, but it searches title, descriptions, notes and tags.\n\n⋆ Large Previews - Rather than looking through lists of titles that you might not be familiar with, webpage previews help you recognise the content you are looking for.\n\n⋆ Import open tabs - Tired of leaving 100s of tabs open across multiple window. Bookmarkit lets you save your open tabs into new collections, allowing you to pick up where you left off at a later date, or even on a different computer.\n\n⋆ Notes - Add notes to give your bookmarks more depth and information. \n\n⋆ Customize your view - Set your preferred view by adjusting the slider on the top right of the results area.
