You will need to browse between the website, and NOT Spectrum, for this plugin to work.\n\nYour contacts are ONLY shared between accounts with the same handle, so your alts are safe with this plugin.\n\nAll information remains safely locked away in your accounts.\n\nAll source available at https://github.com/dolkensp/ptYou"
