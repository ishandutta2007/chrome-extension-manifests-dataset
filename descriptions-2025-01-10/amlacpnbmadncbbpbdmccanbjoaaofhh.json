Pre-Prompts are commands entered at the beginning of a ChatGPT question that guides ChatGPT toward a tailored response - allowing it to generate more detailed and relevant answers. By streamlining the process of using pre-prompts and allowing the use of shorthand commands, SimmerDown helps users unlock the full potential of the AI model. \n\nSome key benefits and functionalities of the extension include:\n\n1.\tTime-saving: With the use of shortened commands (such as !expert), users can quickly insert complex pre-prompts without having to type them out manually. This saves time and effort, making the interaction more efficient.\n\n2.\tCustomization: In addition to the built-in commands, SimmerDown allows users to create and save their own custom commands, tailoring the extension to their specific needs and preferences.\n\n3.\tImproved response quality: By using pre-prompts provided by the extension, users can guide ChatGPT more effectively, resulting in more accurate, detailed, and relevant responses.\n\n4.\tEasy enable/disable: The extension can be easily enabled or disabled via a toggle switch, giving users control over when they want to use the functionality.\n\n5.\tSeamless integration: SimmerDown is designed to work smoothly with Chrome and ChatGPT, ensuring a seamless user experience without any disruptions.\n\n6.\tVersatility: The pre-prompts provided by SimmerDown can cover various domains, such as providing expert knowledge, specific writing styles, or content generation in different contexts. This makes the extension versatile and valuable for users with diverse needs.\n\n7.\tPrivacy-focused: SimmerDown prioritizes user privacy by storing all pre-prompts and commands locally on the user's device. The extension doesn't \"phone home\" or communicate any user data to external servers. This ensures that user data remains confidential and secure, and users can have peace of mind knowing their information is not being captured or shared with third parties."
