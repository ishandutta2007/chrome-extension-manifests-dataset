That really helps us out! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ\n\nVolume Booster 2.0 allows you to increase the volume passed the standard factory setting.\n\nIf you feel that your volume is not loud enough then use Volume Booster 2.0 to enhance the loudness of the audio or video that you are playing. It is simple and easy to use with a sliding bar where you can slide up & down on the volume that you want to use.\n\nTo Turn-Off: Exit out of tab and reopen a new one.\n\nâœ… Easy To Use:\n\n1. Click on our extension logo in your extension bar\n2. Open up a Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music, or any tab that produces sound\n3. Slide the bar to your comfortable volume - All the way up to 600%\n\n\nâœ… Features:\n\n- Increase volume on your computer inside of google chrome tabs\n- Convenient & simplistic design/UI \n- Switch to any tab that plays audio with one click\n- Tells you what is currently playing inside of drop-down extension\n\nðŸ–¥ Full-Screen ðŸ–¥\n\n- Chrome doesnâ€™t allow you to switch to full screen mode when using any extension that processes sound, so you can always see a rectangular icon in the tab bar (to know that the audio is being processed). \nIt is impossible to get around this, after all, it is a good thing that protects you. However, you can improve the situation a bit by pressing F11 (on Windows) or Ctr + Cmd + F (on Mac).\n\n\n\nðŸŒŸ It is free to download and use! ðŸŒŸ"
