We have created Wordbrain Answers aka Wordbrain Solver to help people in solving tough Wordbrain puzzles. Walkthroughs for all the levels are updated along with step by step screenshots.\n\nWordBrain is a word-hunt game similar to classics such as Boggle, where players swipe through a grid of letters to form words. There are hundreds of puzzles with increasing difficulty, and the words are all appropriate for kids at any age (though some are trickier to spell or find than others). The game does feature hints you can purchase with real money with no parent gate, and the temptation to use them is always present, so be wary of your device settings."
