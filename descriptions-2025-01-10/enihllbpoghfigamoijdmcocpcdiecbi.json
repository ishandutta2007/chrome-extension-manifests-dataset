Tracking leave and managing absence is a problem that spreadsheets are not suited for. With Leavetrack, managing staff leave is streamlined, automated and worry free.\n\nThis extension brings Leavetrack to Chrome. Your employees can book leave straight from Chrome without needing to visit Leavetrack. Any of the leave types you define are available to book straight from the browser.\n\nYou will need a valid Leavetrack account in order to use this extension. Leavetrack offers a generous 60 day free trial allowing you to ensure that our approach to leave management is right for your organisation. After that, you pay £1 per active user per month or opt for a lifetime licence at the cost of £999."
