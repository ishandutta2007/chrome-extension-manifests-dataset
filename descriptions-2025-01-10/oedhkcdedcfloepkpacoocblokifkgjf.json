The extension does not require you to sign-in or has anything to do with your Skiff account. After you get your Quick Aliases domain, you can setup the email format and start using the extension right away.\n\nPermissions Note: The extension merely uses the basic permissions to generate a masked email on-page or in the extension when you use the [domain] shortcode in your email format but it does not access anything beyond the hostname of the current website and does not share any details externally nor stores it. The same can be verified by reviewing the full source code available on GitHub: https://github.com/irazasyed/email-masker.\n\nDisclaimer: This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored in any way by Skiff."
