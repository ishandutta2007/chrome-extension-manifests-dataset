In places like Russia, China, and Iran, people are unable to access unbiased news, communicate with their loved ones, or share content revealing state-sponsored human rights abuses.\n\nUnbounded is a crowdsourced computing project to unblock the internet -- using the power of volunteers like you. Install this extension and join millions of others in a network of “digital bridges” connecting people worldwide to the open internet. It’s safe, it’s private, and it’s a simple thing you can do to make a big difference in the fight for digital liberty and human rights around the world.\n\nUnbounded is created by Brave New Software Project, Inc., the nonprofit organization behind the censorship circumvention tool Lantern, dedicated to ensuring fast, reliable, and secure access to the open internet for everyone."
