The main features are as follows:\n\n • Fixing diverse formatting issues and bugs in the forum\n • Identifying users by custom badges, nicknames, and avatars\n • Hot-keys for quick access to diverse sub-forums or even to external websites\n • Hot-keys for inserting reply templates into post answers\n • Automatically detecting spammers and external links\n • Revealing hidden text and links\n • Auto-hiding of spam\n • Notifications for new posts matching custom keywords\n • RSS reader for spam detection and keyword matching\n • Forum crawler scanning old post for spam\n\nThe GFH comes from an independent developer not affiliated with Garmin in any way, except for using their products. It is not an extension released by Garmin! It was developed with the intent of helping fellow users and moderators of the forum.\n\nPublic discussion about the GFH extension is available on Garmin's Forum here: https://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mobile-apps-web/f/garmin-connect-web/377486/forum-helper-browser-extension \n\nINSTALLATION\nAfter installing the GFH extension from the Chrome Web Store, grant it permission to access the site https://forums.garmin.com/, and pin it to the toolbar for easy and quick access to the settings, and for the administration of the extension. Click on the blue G icon of the extension in the toolbar and review the available configuration options.\n\nGFH uses mouse-over tooltips not only over items on its popup window but also over many elements or markup that it injects into the forum pages. You will often get a hint or more detailed data if you hover with the mouse cursor over the element in question.\n\nUSER BADGES\nYou can assign a badge to the user by clicking the user name or avatar above the concerned post. In the same way, you can also change the existing badges. Badges may be removed by deleting the user on the tab \"Users\" on the GFH popup window.\n\nHOTKEYS for REPLY TEMPLATES and for BOOKMARKS\nYou can quickly access sub-forums or other bookmarked links by hitting the key combination Ctrl+Shift+K and then the sequence of three letters as defined in the table on the tab Hotkeys » Bookmarks of the GFH popup window. Similarly, you can insert replies from templates defined on the tab Hotkeys » Reply Templates. And, of course, you can add your own templates and bookmarks.\n\nDOCUMENTATION / CHANGELOG / TODO & BUG lists\nLinks to the up-to-date detailed Documentation, to the Changelog listing changes done in individual versions, and to the To-Do document with lists of planned features, and a list of known issues, are available on the right side of the header of the GFH popup window (after clicking its icon in the browser's navbar, or after opening it from Chrome's extensions management menu).\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nThis extension does not collect any user data, and does not connect to any remote servers. The code is secure and reviewable by any interested party.\n\nFEEDBACK\nComments with bug reports, feature requests, critics, or just kudos are welcome. Donations are welcome too. They help motivate me to maintain and improve the extension:\n • https://paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=724KXVPMHE6DL\n • https://buymeacoffee.com/truxoft \n\nCREDITS\nGFH does not use any external libraries, it was entirely written in pure JavaScript (no jQuery) by its author, however, some help, advice, and inspiration were needed:\n • stackoverflow.com, ChatGPT - valuable advice and troubleshooting\n • Hiromu Ochiai's solution for ES6 “import” [https://github.com/otiai10/]\n • Online minifier by https://jscompress.com/ for compressing and speeding up the code\n • seilogramp, volunteer moderator @ forums.garmin.com - motivation, testing"
