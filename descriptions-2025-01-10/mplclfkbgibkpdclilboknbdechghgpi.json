It's the top book on [Y Combinator's recommended library](http://ycombinator.com/lib.html). \n\nFor years I struggled building an audience. But things are clicking now with my writing and my project [Draft](http://draftin.com) to help people [write better](http://draftin.com).\n\nOne helpful technique I figured out is simply getting better at interacting with more people on Twitter. And I like using people's first names in communication with them. People are blind to their Twitter handles. Who the hell is @natekontny? I prefer Nate or Nathan. I think most other people prefer their own name too. \n\nBut if you use Twitter in any volume, typing people's first names can be quite a task, and it's prone to typos. \n\nnombre was made to automate just a little bit of the typing. \n\nThere's not much to it. After installation, click Reply on a Tweet in your stream, and their first name will automatically be populated in the Tweet box. \n\nP.S.
