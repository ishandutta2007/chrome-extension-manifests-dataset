This can be useful when you need to upload a large file to a ChatGPT that has a character size limit. With File ChatGPT File Uploader, you can split the file into smaller chunks between 1 - 15000 characters and upload them one at a time. The extension adds a button to the page that lets you select a file and automatically splits it into chunks and uploads them for you. \n\nCurrently supports the following file formats:  txt, js , py, css, json, csv.pdf, doc, docx,.xls,.xlsx\n\nIf you would like to support my work, you can donate to paypal.me/Automatemylife\n\nif you are interested in how this was made then check out my channel at : https://www.youtube.com/@automatemylife00"
