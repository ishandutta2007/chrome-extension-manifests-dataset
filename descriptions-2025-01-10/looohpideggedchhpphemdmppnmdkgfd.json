It offers four distinct methods for link transfer:\n\n1) Right-click on a link and select \"Send to IE.\"\n2) Use the browser action button to send the current page to IE.\n3) Customize a left-click action with a modifier key to send the link to IE.\n4) Set up specific hostnames to be sent to IE with a left-click (no modifier is required).\n\nFurthermore, this extension uses managed storage, enabling a domain administrator to configure all network-connected computers to open a particular website in Microsoft's Internet Explorer, eliminating the need for individual machine modifications.\n\nPlease note that this extension employs a native client to execute OS-level commands. The native client is written in JavaScript and relies on official NodeJS as its compiler. It is mandatory to have this native client on your system to establish communication with Microsoft's Internet Explorer. However, please be aware that this native client is currently incompatible with Chrome OS.\n\n--- Legal Information\nIE is a registered trademark of Microsoft Inc. in the U.S. and other countries.
