The two hosts choose a date, time and title for their Tawk and share the link with all their friends, fans and followers from across the web.\n\nIn the audience, you can chime in or just read along. For a comment to get noticed by either host, it must first get voted up by your peers in the crowd. Only the most thoughtful and relevant comments get the attention of the whole room."
