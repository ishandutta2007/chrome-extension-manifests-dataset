It allows you to view 3D Exchange format files through a web browser with out the need for larger packages to be installed on your or someone elses computer. It runs through Javascript and WebGL and is therefore cross platform and available through a number of different browsers.\n\nImporting\nIris can import any of the following model formats. If there's one you don't see then feel free to request it in the 'Issues'.\n\n* stl (both ASCII and Binary)\n* obj (material files not supported yet)\n\nExporting for 3D printing\nIris can can also export to stl files for use in 3D Printing. We currently only support ASCII stl files.\n\nThe Iris Environment has a treeview overlayed on the screen, allowing you to view statistics of each imported models as well as be able to hide and show groups/sub meshes of each model. Other info, such as measurements, are added to the treeview, allowing you to see broken down information (such as the measured distance in each coordinate axis).\n\nNote: This app is still in 'Beta' and should not be used for final production decisions. It should only be used for non-critical reference and conceptual views. You can file any bugs found on our Github page."
