Great in situations where the content is behind a pay wall, special authentication, or you just want to show your friends what you're seeing without a screenshot.\n\n===\n\nSometimes, you read an awesome article online and want to share it with you friend, so you send her the URL of the page, only to get the response \"It's behind a paywall\".\n\nOr maybe you're logged into some web application and you want to show your friend what the page looks like and let her scroll through as if it was the real thing. It could be the case that you want to show your friend all the items in your Amazon cart before you make the purchase.\n\nPerhaps you'd like to take a screenshot of a page and share it with your friend, but the page is too large and you'd have to keep scrolling and take multiple screenshots and somehow send it over in the right order for it to make sense.\n\nReally, all you wanted to do was show your friend the page exactly as you see it. Not compressed in a Jpeg or chopped up into multiple screenshots, but an actually live web page as you are seeing it."
