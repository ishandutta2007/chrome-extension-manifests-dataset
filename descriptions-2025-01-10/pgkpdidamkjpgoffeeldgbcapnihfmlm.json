That's it! \n\nThis extension runs entirely in your browser and makes no external web requests, meaning it does not collect any information about your browsing or the content of web pages.\n\nAll alumni identified are taken from:\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_Cambridge_people\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_Oxford_people\n\nThis project was inspired by a friend who would never miss an opportunity to point out when a celebrity they knew went to Oxford or Cambridge in casual conversation. This is for you."
