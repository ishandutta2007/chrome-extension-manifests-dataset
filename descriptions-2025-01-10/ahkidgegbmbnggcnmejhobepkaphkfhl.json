The extension can get enabled or disabled from the action button. Once the extension is enabled, no animated resource is fetched from the internet. Instead, the remote image is replaced by a local alternative. \n\nWhen blocking mode is enabled, the user can still selectively load blocked images from the right-click context menu over the image context.\n\nHow does it work:\nThis extension redirects all the animated image requests to the local SVG image. This way, there is no server request at all (not even the HEAD request).\n\nFeatures:\nYou can unblock an image from right-click context menu. The unblocking stays for this browser session. Or until the extension is disabled by pressing the toolbar button.\nReduce bandwidth usage significantly by preventing any animated image loading. Animated images use a large amount of bandwidth compared to normal images.\nOptionally disable the extension for WebP or GIF image format.\nOptionally block video elements from auto-playing\nOptionally block CSS animation"
