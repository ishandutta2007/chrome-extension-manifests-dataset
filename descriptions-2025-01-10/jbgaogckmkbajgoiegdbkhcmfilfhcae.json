Since facebook only allows you to have 5,000 friends, this allows you to easily identify and remove people who aren't engaging.\n\nThere are hundreds of use cases for PowerCircles and we look forward to hearing yours as we continue to build one of the most powerful social media account management tools around.\n\nDisclaimer: Power Circles extension is not endorsed by Facebookâ„¢ in any way."
