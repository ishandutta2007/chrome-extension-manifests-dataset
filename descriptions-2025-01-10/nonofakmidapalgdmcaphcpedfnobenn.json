Save an article and start highlighting text as you read. Your notes will be automatically saved into a Notion page. \n\nMade a mistake? Simply open the hidden sidebar and delete highlights.\n\nThis tool is the ultimate productivity hack. Have you ever read an article and thought - this could have been a few bullets — or have a list of saved articles you keep rereading for the core material? You can now save what you need and store it for future use. \n\nWHO AM I?\n• • • • • \nI’m an avid reader and productivity junkie. Before Notion, I used Pocket, GSheet, and various apps to save articles, summarize the core takeaways, to share them with my friends, family, and peers.\n\nSince moving my entire workflow to Notion, I built this extension to highlight core takeaways, summarize them later, add my commentary, and retrieve them when needed.\n\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\n• • • • • \nMy passion is continually improving this product for you. Tell me how you use it or what you would like to see. I read all emails and respond 1:1 in a timely manner. \n\nEmail: notion@sajad.co."
