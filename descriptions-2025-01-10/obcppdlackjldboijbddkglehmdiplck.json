THIS WILL NOT SHOW LIVE CLOCK at either place!\n\n_______\nCustomize each of the HOURS/MINUTES/SECONDS hands:\n    - Pick your own colors with intuitive color panels\n    - Select transparency levels with easy bar sliders\n    - If you don't want a particular CIRCLE or HAND (say, HOURS CIRCLE or HOURS HAND) use the transparency bar sliders to set them to ZERO (take them all the way to the extreme left)\n    - Select your own thickness of the CIRCLE or HAND\n\n_______\nAdditional Hovering-Dynamic-Circle For SECONDS:\n    - Pick a Fill color to add radiant gloss\n    - Pick a Shine color to add radiant glow\n    - Go wild and try various combinations\n\nSee As You Change - Intuitive Live Preview, SAVE once you like what you see\n\nSupports 8 languages to help you with your customized settings.\n\n_______\nRuns efficiently:\n    - runs only in one active tab per window of the browser\n    - all other instances are paused. This is why we need the permissions to dynamically run/pause per tab. Is usually very quick to stop running in previously active tabs and instantly runs the clock in your newly active tab.\n\nVery lightweight:\nOnly adds a DIV & a CANVAS to your HTML content.\n\n_______\nPLACE your clock:\n    - IMAGINE ORIGIN (0,0) at the bottom-left corner of your browser window\n    - SELECT your horizontal x offset\n    - SELECT your vertical y offset\n    - INTUITIVE LIVE PREVIEW SHOWS WHERE your clock will be displayed once you hit save\n\nYou didn't save yet, but you don't like your last set of changes?:\n    - Easy, just select \"Current Settings\" from PRESETS dropdown\n    - It does an undo and takes you back to the settings of what's currently running the clock\n\nREMEMBER to hit SAVE button\n    - After hitting save (and closing the popup options screen), try to go back to another tab and you should instantly see the new settings take effect.\n\n_______\nTO SEE BIGGER SETTINGS SCREEN visually, Move your mouse over to and hover on the SETTINGS GEAR ICON at the top right of the SETTINGS SCREEN and just click it. This should launch the SETTINGS SCREEN in a new tab. Use your normal ZOOM controls of the browser (like Ctrl+ and Ctrl-) to zoom in.\n\n_______\nKnown issues:\n    - Transparency levels of the digital time (background color and text color) is occasionally not honored by the pinned icon\n    - On uninstall, kindly refresh the tabs to remove the clock face\n    - Sometimes, if you see any flicker or if your clock is paused (say, on your system's sleep & wakeup, on long running sites (e.g.: Youtube) or if you've shifted across mutliple tabs too quickly in a matter of seconds with keyboard shortcuts or via programmatic controllers without necessary wait periods), please refresh your latest active tab to run the clock in it.\n\nABSOLUTELY, NO DATA is collected, nothing is transmitted over the network. DOES NOT READ OR STORE any of your personal data, any of your browsing activities. Only saves your customized settings of your clock face using Chrome's storage API."
