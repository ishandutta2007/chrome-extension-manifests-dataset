Just add mayonnaise to a... pudding and, yes -- now it's superior to pudding, much better!\n\nEvery day we face harsh reality which pours on us tons of bad news from internet. There are many shitty websites with shitty content.\n\nBut, what if we have some sort of thing like mayonnaise for food, but for Internet, to make it better? To transform bad content into better content? This is exactly why MAYO was created -- to make Internet better.\n\nJust add MAYO to any website and see how it becomes better.\n\n\nResources used in this extension:\n * Sound composed from free \"Sandyrb Revolting Flatulence\" pack by sandyrb\n   https://freesound.org/people/sandyrb/packs/6973/\n\n * Icon of Mayonaise jar from icons8.com\n   https://icons8.com/icon/37561/mayonnaise"
