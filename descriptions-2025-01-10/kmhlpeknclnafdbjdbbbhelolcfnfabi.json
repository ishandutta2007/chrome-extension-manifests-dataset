This extension allows you to remove these sites from your search results, to give you more space for the results that actually matter to you.\n\nHow to use:\n1. Install the extension\n2. Configure the list of domains you don't want to see on Google\n3. Enjoy a cleaner search experience âœ¨\n\n100% Open Source: https://github.com/goenning/refined-search-results"
