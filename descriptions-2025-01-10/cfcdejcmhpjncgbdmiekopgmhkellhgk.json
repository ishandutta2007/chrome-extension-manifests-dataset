Every time you visit your favorite social media site, your brain gets a hit of dopamine that keeps you coming back again and again.\n\nDopamine Blocker attempts to breaks that cycle. Now, instead of getting a hit of dopamine when you visit the social media site, you will be faced with an annoying alarm and a rapidly moving page that is hard to read. Your brain won't get the dopamine you crave and you will hopefully stop subconsciously associating social media sites as a dopamine source*.\n\nCurrently works with:\nFacebook, Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube. \n\nEach site can be turned on and off in the options page for this extension.\n\n* These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and this extension should not be considered a medical device, medical treatment, or anything similar.
