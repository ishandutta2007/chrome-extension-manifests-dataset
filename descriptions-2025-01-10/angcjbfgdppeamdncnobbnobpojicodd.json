These images help to deprogram you from consumer culture, and instead remind you to bring your reusable produce bags to the store, to make your own cleaning products, to use rags instead of paper towels, etc.\n\nWith fun \"ads\" such as \"Do you really need that?\" and \"Buy Second-Hand\", we hope you'll enjoy this subtle motivation to live a low waste, plant based lifestyle!\n\nEcoBlock is based on the CatBlock ad-blocking extension, and is free to use and modify under the GNU General Public License."
