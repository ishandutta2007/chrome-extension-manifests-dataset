It essentially provides a subtitle-like experience for reading screenplays. Since not all movies in Netflix are supported, we show a constantly updated list of movies supported in our website here https://screenplaysubs.com/movies\n\n>Who is this for?\nScreenplaySubs delivers plenty of rewatch value to the movie you're watching. You'll get insights to different scenes you may have not yet realized, including:\n- When a dialogue is improvised/reworded.\n- When a scene is omitted or included in production/post.\n- What an action is trying to emphasize on.\n- When the order between two scenes are switched.\n- In general how an action, dialogue, or scene heading is translated to screen.\n\n>I'm interested! How do I set this up?\n- Awesome! Install the browser extension.\n- Check out the movie catalogue for movies to watch, and press \"Watch\".\n- That's about it! You'll be redirected to Netflix and can start watching the movie.\n\nMovie, Film, Netflix, Education, Screenplays, Film Student, Filmmaker",
