I've made this browser extension to ease the interaction of external website with the official Altered TCG website.\n\nThis tool allows to:\n* Receive a decklist that has been created in an external platform (e.g. Altered TCG Builder) and imports it into the official Altered TCG website. This enables to create decks in external platforms and then import them into the official site to play with them on BGA.\n* Export your collection into text so that it can be imported into other applications.\n\nAs expected, this extension is open-source (GPL 3.0): https://github.com/Ajordat/alteredbuilder-extension\n\nThis extension is designed with your security and privacy in mind. It uses your session token solely to authenticate with the official website and perform the deck import process. The token is retrieved directly from your browser's cookies and is never stored, shared, or used for any purpose beyond importing your deck. Once the import is complete, the token is immediately discarded. The extension does not save any of your personal data or interact with any third-party servers.\n\nTo ensure complete transparency, the extension's code is open-source and licensed under the GPL-3.0. This means anyone can review the code to verify its functionality and security. The repository is publicly available, providing you with the opportunity to see exactly how the token is used and to confirm that it is only utilized to communicate with the official website's API during the import process. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out or explore the code yourself!\n\nLink to the repository: https://github.com/Ajordat/alteredbuilder-extension\n\n\nEnjoy!"
