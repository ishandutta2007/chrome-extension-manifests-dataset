Pocket) or manually email ourselves - it's painful 😰! With InboxThis, you can send any article/web page to your email inbox in just 1 click 👆, without switching windows 🖥️! Yep, in just 1 CLICK, you can send any article or page around the web to your email inbox. This is perfect to save a article you want to read later 🕦, or just to keep it in your inbox 🔖.\n\nNo signup or account creation needed - just install the extension and you're set ✅\n\nInboxThis was made because I always save stuff I find on the web - especially articles to read later. In the past, I tried different ways to save them (browser bookmarks, web bookmarklet, online bookmarker, Pocket app, etc.). Just like the simplest solutions are often the best, I ended up just using emails - sending myself emails with the link I wanted to save. It's time-consuming though: copy the URL, open my email, compose a new one, paste it in the body, type my email address to be the recipient, click send, then go back to wherever I was, each time. \n\nSo we created the InboxThis Chrome extension, to send any article/website to your inbox in just 1 click! It works like this:\n1. When you're on a page/article you want to save, you click on our extension icon in Chrome.\n2. Done - it's now in your email inbox!\n\nIt's a small product but something we wanted for ourselves so we ended up building it. Hopefully it's helpful to others.\n\nPS: We don't store or sell your data (the URLs you save or your email - it's stored in your browser / LocalStorage)\n\nIt works great for web bookmarks or as a Chrome bookmarklet or bookmarker. Similar to Emailthis to read it later, email article, email this page, email URL to your email inbox. Send articles & web pages to your email inbox. An alternative to read-it-later or \"read later apps like Pocket or Instapaper or even Readability but for your email inbox!"
