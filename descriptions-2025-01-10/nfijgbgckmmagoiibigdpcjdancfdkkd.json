It can be intimidating trying to build up your portfolio over time with a sensible buy and hold strategy while seeing your holdings have dropped in value hundreds or thousands of dollars in a day. \n\nThis extensions hides parts of common Aussie stock broking and portfolio management websites that may influence negative investor behaviour in bad times. Things like daily share price movement, comparisons with indexes and your total portfolio amount are all hidden on purpose. It also hides the details of your holdings and the sell button, so you can't sell anything while this extension is running. \n\nOther operations like buying, adding positions to management tools and portfolio allocation by percentage are still accessible. \n\nProducts supported:\n\n- selfwealth.com.au\n- sharesight.com\n\nPlease let us know what other brokers or management tools you would like to see supported."
