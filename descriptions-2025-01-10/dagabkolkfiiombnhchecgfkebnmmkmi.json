You will be able to add that domain to your own NoMerge list.\n\nNow, whenever you go to a pull request within that repository, the GitHub merge button will be found by the extension, and disabled, so that you can't accidently click it.\nIt will show in bright red, with a message to act as a visual reminder that you don't want to be manually merging the pull request.\n\nIt is designed for users that have their own merge policy. Some people like to merge through their CI/CD system, so they can trigger any events that may need to occur.\n\nIf you don't want the repository to be a NoMerge tracked repository, then you can simply go to the URL that you originally added, and click the extension, and then press 'Remove from the NoMerge List' to remove it from your list. Now, the extension will no longer disable the button on pull requests in that repository."
