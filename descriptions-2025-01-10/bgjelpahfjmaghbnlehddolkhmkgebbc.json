When you initially open the app, it may ask if you want to allow microphone access. Please select Yes in the dialog box to start the add-on. Also, keep in mind that the program may take a few moments to load completely.\n\nPlease be patient as the add-on is being prepared. Once the loader has vanished, the add-on is ready to use. The add-on captures sound using your system's microphone. If you don't have a microphone on your computer, attach one before utilizing it with this add-on. On the top toolbar of the interface, you'll find several pieces of information regarding the ambient noise. You may also change the capturing sound API by clicking buttons at the top right. \n\nThe interface of this program may be accessed from a new tab, window, or toolbar popup. To see the microphone permission dialog when you initially launch the software, open it in a new window or tab."
