This extension has been tested and works as intended. The tab should open rarely, not so frequently that it becomes annoying. It is not likely that you will encounter it in minimal testing, as there is only a 1% chance the tab will open. Please take this into consideration during your review process. If you still feel that this extension is \"non-functional\" please take a look at this code in comparison to the last approved version's and/or reach out to me with a way that I can speak with someone directly to prove it works. \n\nEach time a tab is opened, there is a 1 in 100 chance that it will also open the \"Magic Word\" tab. THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEED OCCURRENCE. The \"Magic Word\" tab is a video of Dennis Nedry saying \"Ah Ah Ah, you didn't say the magic word\". This extension is just for a fun little Jurassic Park reference every once in a while."
