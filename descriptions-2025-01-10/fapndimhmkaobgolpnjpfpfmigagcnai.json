The extension, called \"I Wanna,\" is designed to improve the productivity and convenience of users who frequently work with text by giving them an easy-to-use and intuitive interface for performing various tasks.\n\nWith I Wanna, users can create custom prompts that appear when they select text, offering them a range of actions to choose from based on the context and nature of the text. For example, if a user selects a block of text that they want to summarize, they can use the \"I Wanna\" prompt to generate a summary of the selected text. Similarly, if they want to translate the selected text into another language, they can use the prompt to perform the translation quickly and accurately.\n\nOne of the key features of the I Wanna extension is its ability to integrate with OpenAI's powerful natural language processing (NLP) technology. By tapping into the advanced capabilities of OpenAI's API, the extension is able to provide users with high-quality summaries, translations, and other text-based services that are accurate and reliable.\n\nAnother important feature of the I Wanna extension is its context menu integration, which allows users to access the prompt quickly and easily by right-clicking on selected text. This makes it possible to perform a wide range of text-related tasks without having to leave the current webpage or application, streamlining the workflow and reducing the time and effort required to perform common tasks.\n\nOverall, the I Wanna extension is a powerful and versatile tool that is designed to help users work more efficiently with text. Whether you need to generate summaries, translate text, or perform any other type of text-based task, I Wanna provides an easy-to-use and reliable solution that can help you get the job done quickly and effectively."
