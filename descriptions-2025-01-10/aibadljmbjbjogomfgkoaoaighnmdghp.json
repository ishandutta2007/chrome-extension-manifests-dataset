More resources used by Google Chrome means less resources available for other applications, which can make other applications, games, and Google Chrome itself slower. To solve this particular problem, you can either upgrade your computer's memory, in some cases processor; or you can close unnecessary tabs that are open in Google Chrome. That's where Akira comes in!\n\nIf you have a bunch of Chrome windows, with a bunch of open tabs, and you are afraid to tackle that huge mess of websites, just use Akira! You can group all open tabs by window/website, sort them alphabetically; then bookmark the important, and discard the unnecessary. If you accidentally close a tab/tabs, you can find and open them again from the \"Recently Closed Tabs\" section.\n\n\n* Resources:\n\nEach computer has:\n\n- Processor (CPU): Performs all the calculations, executes all the instructions that make up a computer program. Google Chrome's usage of the processor is not that significant, but if your processor is low-end (netbook, ultrabook, budget notebook/desktop), then it may have an effect on the speed of your computer.\n\n- Memory** (RAM): Stores data temporarily, until you shut down, reboot, or put your computer to sleep. This data can be pictures, programs, operating system itself, and Google Chrome tabs, and their content. The more tabs open, the more data is stored in the memory. All applications need some space in the memory to run, therefore if you try to run a game, or resource hungry application while there is low free space in the memory, the operating system/application will limit how much memory it will use. This can slow down your computer."
