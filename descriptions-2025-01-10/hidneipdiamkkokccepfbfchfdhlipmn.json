They can be clicked on for more detailed information such as the full date or a calendar view of the current month.\n\nDetailed Weather\nIf you click on the weather icon, you will see a forecast for the day and for the week presented in a beautiful customizable color-coded chart.\n\nFully customizable\nMany features in Evergreen are customizable, including: background blur, temperature units, date and time formats and types of backgrounds.\n\nImage caching\nEvergreen has extremely little loading time, since it saves and displays the last shown background and downloads a new one in the background. You can also tell Evergreen to only download a background every so often to save data.\n\nWorks offline\nEvergreen shows the last background and last weather report to display when offline.\n\n--Evergreen requires your location to show the weather. Evergreen exclusively uses your location to get the weather, and uses it for nothing else.--"
