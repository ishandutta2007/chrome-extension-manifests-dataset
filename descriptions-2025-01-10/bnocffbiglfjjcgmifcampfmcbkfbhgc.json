I've received reports from users that they have lost bookmarks. Unfortunately, I don't have any way to recover them for you - you may try to locate them among your existing bookmarks if that happens. HOWEVER, I'm keen to fix this bug, and I need your help to provide me with the steps required to reproduce the issue. If anyone encounters this issue, I would really appreciate if you could provide me (via the SUPPORT section) with the following information:\n\n1. Chrome version number\n2. OS type and version number (e.g. Windows 10, Mac OS X 10.11)\n3. Version number of this extension (if you're using the latest, it's 2.1 as of now)\n4. Was it a fresh install?\n5. What were you doing with the extension before you lost bookmarks?*\n6. Any other relevant information that would help me with diagnosing the issue\n\n*Emphasis on #5. If you could provide me step-by-step instructions on replicating the issue especially on a freshly installed Chrome, and I'm able to successfully replicate the issue from my end, I *will* be able to figure out the issue and fix the problem.\n\n[HOW TO USE]\nClick on the Switchmark icon to switch between bookmark bars. To create additional bookmark bars, right-click the icon and go to Options.\n\n[CHANGELOG]\nVersion 2.1 (2014-12-09)\nBug fix for inability to identify the Bookmarks Bar folder.\n\nVersion 2.0 (2014-12-06)\nMajor improvements and bug fixes for bookmark folder management. Added an Options page to enable users to easily set the number of Bookmarks Bars to use."
