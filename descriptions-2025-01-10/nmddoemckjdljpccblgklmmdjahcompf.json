However, it is likely that this is fuelled by the Mail's renowned ability to generate outrage with it's news articles across social media such as Facebook and Twitter. What if you want to investigate the story that your friends and followers have linked to, but have no wish to add to the Mail's visitor analytics?\n\nSimply install this plugin and any time you try to load a page from the Daily Mail or the Daily Express, you will be redirected to a search page for that news item that excludes the Mail and the Express from it's results."
