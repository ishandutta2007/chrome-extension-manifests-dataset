Once the app is open, it starts to process the page in order to find all images.\n\nYou can now click on a single image to download or click on the - Select All - button to select and download all images at once. Alternatively, you can select a single image to download. There are several settings to adjust in the app. For example, you can set the minimum and maximum image size, or even the type of the image to capture.\n\nIf you right-click on the toolbar button, you can set the app to open in toolbar popup instead of a new tab. Please note that default option is opening in a new tab.\n\nPlease read FAQ (http://eccorem.com/apps/image-downloader.html) page for this addon to get more info on how to work with this addon."
