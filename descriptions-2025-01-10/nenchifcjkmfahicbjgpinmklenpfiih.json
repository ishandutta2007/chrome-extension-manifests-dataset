If you have a set of websites that you tend to visit for a specific task, the extension allows you to save your tabs into a workspace which can be quickly reopened from a new Chrome window or tab. Workspaces are capable of storing whether a tab within your preset is pinned as well. You can easily save the tabs open in a current window by clicking the Workspace Launcher icon from the top right of your Chrome window. Workspaces can also be created from the Workspace Launcher interface itself.\n\nCreate a workspace for:\n- Typical sites you visit to start off the day\n- Resources for a specific work project\n- Sites you use for a school course\n- Social media sites\n- Blogs you follow\n- Any set of sites you want to revisit in the future!"
