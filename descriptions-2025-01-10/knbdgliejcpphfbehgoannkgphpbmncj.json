You are trying to be productive and suddenly you find yourself scrolling on Facebook, Reddit or any other distracting place.\n\nFocusFox helps you to prevent this. By setting up simple rules, you will be redirected from the websites you actually don't want to visit anymore to website you should spend more time on. \n\nFocusFox is continually being developed. In the near future, you will be able to set your own schedule, randomize your redirect rules and set up more rules.\n\nDo you have questions, suggestions or just want to say hi?
