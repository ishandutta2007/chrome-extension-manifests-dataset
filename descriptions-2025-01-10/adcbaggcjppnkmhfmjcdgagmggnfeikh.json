Additional information on the server is accessible by clicking on the shown IP address.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Converts IP to Flag without resorting to an external server. It works completely offline\n2. Provides more info about the IP address on a click\n3. Flag's position can be altered by dragging and dropping it to a new location.\n4. Uses an up-to-date offline MaxMind database to convert IP addresses to country.\n5. Periodically updates the database from GitHub\n6. Works on manifest v3 (the extension idles when it is not active, so it does not use any resources when not needed)\n\n--\nIf you prefer the flag to appear in your action area, try:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/country-flags-ip-whois/bffjckjhidlcnenenacdahhpbacpgapo"
