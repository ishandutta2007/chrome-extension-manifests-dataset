The extension reads the headline of any news article you are reading and then searches for the most relevant petition based on that headline (sometimes with...interesting results).\n\nCurrently on clicking the icon a popup occurs, loads the current open petitions in, then you can select either a random petition, start a new petition or view the suggested petition based on the current news article they are viewing. It then displays the current signature count and gives you  the option to visit the page of that specific petition.\n\nThis extension can be used on any news website, although keep in mind it is for linked only to petitions on the UK Government petition site, and is limited to the current open petitions (usually around 1900). Not all suggested petitions will seem relevant as it is searching based on the headline only at this time (you can always start your own petition!).\n\nIn the future a selection of results will be displayed and the search may be opened up to be based on the content of the news article as well.\n\nPlease note this is not an official UK Government and Parliament chrome extension."
