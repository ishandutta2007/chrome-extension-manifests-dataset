What do consumers need to know in order to protect themselves and their families from identity theft?  Information is key.  The more we know about how companies use our personal information, the better prepared we are when deciding whether or not to divulge it.  PrivacyCheck is a valuable resource that consumers can use to get an overview of the essential attributes of a company’s online privacy policy in way that is quick and easy to understand.\n\nFederal and state laws require businesses to publicly post a privacy policy stating how they use customers’ Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has successfully prosecuted companies for deceptive and misleading practices when using consumers’ data in ways contrary to what is stated in their privacy policy. As a result, most companies’ privacy policies are easily accessible online.  The problem is that many people do not have time to read these lengthy and sometimes technical documents.\n\nPrivacyCheck is a browser add-on intended to provide consumers an overview of the ways in which companies use their personal data in a graphical, ‘at-a-glance’ format.  Similar, currently available resources fall short of this goal due to their lack of comprehensive web coverage.  For example, TRUSTe and P3P are sign-up services that require a business to enroll in order to participate, and multiple crowd-sourced efforts only provide information for websites that have been manually checked.\n\nPrivacyCheck surpasses existing add-ons, apps, and certifications by using a Machine Learning algorithm to access the text of any webpage.  The user provides the URL for the company’s privacy policy and PrivacyCheck searches the page, returning icons that indicate the level of risk for several types of PII.  \n\nCopyright © 2021 The University of Texas at Austin, Center for Identity, All Rights Reserved.\n\nContact: Razieh Nokhbeh Zaeem, razieh@identity.utexas.edu."
