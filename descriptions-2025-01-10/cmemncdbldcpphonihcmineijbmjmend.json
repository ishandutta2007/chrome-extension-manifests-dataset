Especially if you are looking for dental treatments our extension will help you to find best dental treatment in Turkey.\n\nMedical care in Turkey overall is undergoing the process of becoming more harmonized with standards of care for all EU countries. In the past decades, the country has made major strides in improving medical care, including dental care. \n\nTurkey has both government-run public hospital and clinics, and also private facilities. Private dental clinics are better at accommodating foreigners. These clinics often have English-speaking staff. Also, compared to public facilities, private dental clinics have state-of-the-art equipment that are regularly maintained. While some Turkish public hospitals may have shortcomings, the vast majority of Turkish dental clinics that cater to foreigners don’t. \n\nIn general, Turkey maintains highly acceptable standards and regulations when it comes to dental care. You can benefit from strict EU regulations that apply to the country as well. However, the quality of care can vary depending on the skill of the dentist. Therefore, choose a well-reviewed clinic in Turkey with an experienced dentist for your treatments. \n\nTurkish dental care is quite comparable to developed countries like the U.S. and Germany. American clinics may have more equipment, which in some cases aren’t even necessary. In Turkey, dentists use standard equipment approved by regulatory authorities. The main difference between dental care in Turkey and elsewhere in the developed world is the cost. In Turkey, costs are far cheaper."
