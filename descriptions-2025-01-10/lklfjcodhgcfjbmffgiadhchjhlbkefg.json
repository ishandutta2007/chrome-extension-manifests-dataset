Here are some of the ways to use it:\n1. Promote your website, blog, and other social media websites. Why limit the party to only one profile?\n2. Generate passive monthly income from purchases your followers are already making.\n3. Use the valuable window of time to communicate a message or promote a cause.\n\nHow to use:\n1.
