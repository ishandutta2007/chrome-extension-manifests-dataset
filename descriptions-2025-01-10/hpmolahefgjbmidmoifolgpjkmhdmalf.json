This saves time visually hunting down the active tab and provides consistency for the user. Very simple and useful on touch screens. The icon is designed to work with dark and light themes.\n\n*Note: If this extension gets hidden by Chrome, you can get your icon back by pinning it. It happens sometimes. :)\n\n*Tip: On PC you can also press Ctrl+W to close tabs (when keyboard input isn't being captured by a plugin). On Mac this is CMD+W.\n\nPlease note that the options screen contains recommendations from me (ads) to help you support this software.\n\nP.S. Have you found a bug? Email address is provided in the options screen. Happy browsing."
