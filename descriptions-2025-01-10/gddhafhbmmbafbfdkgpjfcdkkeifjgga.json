The new buttons are compact and simple, so they don't slow down the site.\n\nI've also taken the liberty of providing a button that will instantly copy a chosen story to your clipboard, saving you the hassle of selecting a story when you want to share it.\n\nI'm not affiliated with MyLifeIsAverage.com; I just like reading it.\n\nIssues? Comments? Email me at tyler.wayne.dev@gmail.com. Put MLIx somewhere in the subject and I'll be grateful. A GitHub repository will be coming soon, but for now that email address will have to do."
