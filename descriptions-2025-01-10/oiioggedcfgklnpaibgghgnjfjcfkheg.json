We also have an Automated Finder for it. \n\nThe Average true range (ATR) is a volatility indicator that shows how much an asset moves, on average, during a given time frame. The indicator can help day traders confirm when they might want to initiate a trade, and it can be used to determine the placement of a stop-loss order.\n\nThe ADX Indicator also plays an important role on this same indicator. ADX stands for Average Directional Movement Index and can be used to help measure the overall strength of a trend. The ADX indicator is an average of expanding price range values.\n\nThe PS ATR Variant Indicator has also been equipped with an algorithm that detects the famous Bollinger Squeeze techinique.\n\nThe Bollinger Band Squeeze is a straightforward strategy that is relatively simple to implement. First, look for securities with narrowing Bollinger Bands and low BandWidth levels. Second, wait for a band break to signal the start of a new move.\n\nAll of these indicators working in conjuction makes a very well predictive trading indicator that you can put to work in many different kind of markets: Crypto, Stocks, Metals, etc.\n\nOur tailored Finder Tool for this TradingView indicator allows you in very few clicks to find thousands of possible combinations and strategies.\n\nTo better serve your needs, one of the top traders on cat.trade discord community will host a conference to teach you the ins and outs on using this indicator.\n\n\nJoin us at Discord to know more about this and other useful indicators, besides you can have free lessons of manual trading and deep understanding the market. \n\nDiscord link: https://discord.gg/UypkDPZ\n\nwww.cat.trade is a Social Copy Trading platform where you can also become a leader, earn money and learn a lot.\n\nIf you have any ideas on where we can implement our custom backtester automation solution, let us know.\n\nTo buy a full licence and support the continuous development of new features and bug fixes, click the \"Buy licence\" link on the extension or contact Josh X on Cat.trade Discord."
