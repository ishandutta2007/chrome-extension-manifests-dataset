The only page I intentionally skipped was the \"Full Stats\" page for each type of game.\n\nI found that I got a lot of stress out of knowing my rating progression, and the ratings of my opponents. I constantly felt I should be doing better when my rating was below its peak, and I felt a lot of pressure to beat lower rated opponents. In addition to that I felt a lot of frustration when I didn't manage to get my rating back up or when I lost to said lower rated opponents. So I fixed it by hiding the ratings everywhere.\n\nI may update this plugin now and then if I feel like it, but there's absolutely no guarantee of continued support."
