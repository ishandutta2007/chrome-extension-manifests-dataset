This extension is here to help. \n \nWith the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data for any and all websites that sell it. But it can be difficult to determine which websites actually sell this data, and how to opt out on those that do. \n \nWith this extension, you are automatically notified every time you access a site that sells your data. You can exercise your rights and opt out through our popup, or whitelist a site and stop receiving notifications for it. Either way, you stay informed about how your data is being used, and are enabled to exercise your rights.\n \nOur permissions are used to store information about which sites you no longer wish to receive notifications for. We do not and will never collect any personally identifying information from any of our users."
