So if we all sent 1 less email per day we’d save over 16,433  tonnes of carbon a year. That’s why OVO’s launched its Carbon Capper. Download it for free and it’ll pop up every time you hit ‘send’ on an email with fewer than four words, prompting you to stop and think. \n\nEmails will always beat letter-writing because we save paper, but this extension reminds us that our digital messaging habits have an impact too.\n\nLet’s not get too heavy about this, it’s good to communicate. But, be honest, how many of the emails you ping off are essential, and how many are more ‘cute cat, LOOL’ or ‘brill, thanks again’? Rather than emailing a ‘thank you’ to someone sitting next to you, why not say it in person?We now know that spending hours online can damage our mental health – in the same way, too many emails can be a negative thing. Who doesn’t sigh when 50 unread messages pop up each time you open your inbox? \n\nOVO’s Carbon Capper prompts a mindful pause before you send – to think about what we’re communicating and why – and the carbon impact it’ll have. \n\nFind out more about why we created this extension here: https://www.ovoenergy.com/blog/ovo-news/think-before-you-thank\n\nDownload it today and help kick the carbon, one email at a time!\n\nThe Carbon Capper is only available on the latest version of Chrome. To update your browser, click the 'More' button in the top right of your Chrome window, select 'Update Google Chrome', and relaunch.  If you don't see this option - you're all up to date."
