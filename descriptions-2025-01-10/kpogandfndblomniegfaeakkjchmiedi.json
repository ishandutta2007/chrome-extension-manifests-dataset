This one remembers whats been removed, and removes it whenever the page is loaded again.\n\nOnce installed, press the toolbar button to start removing elements. Press the button again to stop. The options page will then be displayed showing what you've removed. Just press Close if you don't want to make any tweaks.\n\nWildcards can be used to make it work on multiple pages from the same site (for example) and an optional delay can be set in case the element you want to remove doesn't get displayed right away.\n\nContribute: https://github.com/Gruntfuggly/nukem\n\nNotes: \nUnfortunately, some websites generate content dynamically in a way that this extension can't cope with. Right click the toolbar icon to visit the options page. Then try adding a delay or reducing the scope (with the left arrow button) if the element doesn't get removed when the page is refreshed after saving your changes."
