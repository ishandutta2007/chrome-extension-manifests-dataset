React x panel recognizes every component that follows this pattern RXP-<id>-RXP, where \\<id> is unique identifier that you can choose, **so you have to add this id on every component that you want to track, otherwise it will be ignored\n\n2. Then, in google chrome follow these steps in the dev tool (on the url of your application)\n\n3. That's the result\n\n4. Now you can prompt your react app src (without /src at the end) like this:\n\n5. Now you can finally debug your react app ‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nif you want to contribute\nsource code: https://github.com/Giuseppe7887/x-panel"
