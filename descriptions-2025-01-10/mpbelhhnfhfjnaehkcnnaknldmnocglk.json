The number of errors of a HTML page is seen with an icon in the browser status bar. The details is seen in the developer tools.\n\nThe extension is based on HTML Tidy. The algorithm was originally developed by the Web Consortium W3C. The algorithm is embedded inside your browser and makes the validation locally on your machine, without sending  HTML to a third party server.\n\nHTML Tidy is a helpful program that tries to help people to correct their HTML errors. It finds HTML errors and classifies them in 3 categories:\n* errors: HTML errors that Tidy cannot fix or understand.\n* warnings: HTML errors that Tidy can fix automatically\n* (optional) accessibility warnings: HTML warnings for the 3 priority levels defined in W3c WAI\n\nThere is also an automatic \"Clean up\" button that will do his best to propose you a cleaned version of your page, without errors.\n\nFor any question, mail me at mgueury@skynet.be or log a bug in: \n> https://gitlab.com/mgueury/html_validator/issues"
