With Figink, you can now preview Figma design files, prototypes and FigJam files directly within GitHub, streamlining your workflow and enhancing collaboration.\n\nLive Figma Previews: \n\nInstantly view Figma files and prototypes within GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions. Previews updates in real-time, ensuring that you're always looking at the latest design iterations.\n\nHow it works:\n\nSimply copy a link to a Figma file or prototype, paste it anywhere in GitHub and get a embedded preview directly beneath the link.\n\nTarget Specific Layers:\n\nCopy a link to a specific layer within a design file to get an embedded preview for the specific area of your designs.\n\nInteractive Prototypes: \n\nNot just static designs - interact with Figma prototypes within GitHub to understand the flow and functionality of the design.\n\nFigJam:\n\nImprove team collaboration with FigJam. Share previews to these collaborative files to surface  your progress without leaving your favorite issue tracker!\n\nUsing Versions:\n\nOnce your designs are finalized, copy links to specific Figma versions for your design or FigJam files to preserve historical changes.\n\n\nEnjoy using Figink!"
