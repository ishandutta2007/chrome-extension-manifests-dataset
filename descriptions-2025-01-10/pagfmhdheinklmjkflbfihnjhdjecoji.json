The aim of the PSNM Platform is to store personal data in an anonymized form = not readable form. If the user wants to display this pseudonymized data later, he sees data in not-readable form (Example: „John“ is pseudonymized as a „de21). The plugin allows you to display personal data that is pseudonymized, in their real form (wording). Chrome Extension can be used only with the PSNM Platform, becasue PSNM Platfrom contains pseudonymization logic. During the de-pseudonymization process, chrome extension is connected to the customer PSNM platform and then used for the de-pseudonymization of personal data displayed in web browser.\n\nPSNM Platfrom is an application developed by Adastra, Ltd. and can be part of Campaign managemnt tool (Exponea), which is placed in Google Cloud. The PSNM platform is implemented for customers, who have higher requirements for personal data protection and require pseudonymization of data stored in the cloud over all the world. PSNM Extension is useable only in internal coroporate networks."
