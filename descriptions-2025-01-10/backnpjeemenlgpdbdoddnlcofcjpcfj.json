Click on the extension to open a maze, which is randomly generated, and then try to solve it. You can keep generating new mazes, which are all different from each other. The bar at the bottom of your maze shows how much time you have left! In later updates, we will add new mazes of different complexity, and the ability to change the amount of time. A high-score tracker is coming soon!"
