Therefore, Chrome starts faster when it is running in the background. You won't believe how fast Chrome opens.\n\nWith this extension, you can receive push notifications even when the browser is closed.\n\nNote: Make sure that the \"Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed\" option is turned on in Chrome. \n(Settings > System > Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed)"
