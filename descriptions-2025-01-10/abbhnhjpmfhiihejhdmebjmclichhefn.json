This can now also work in reverse, taking you from Yahoo Finance back to Robinhood. \nIf you’re on one of these websites, but not on the page for one specific company, the extension will instead just send you to the homepage of the other site. \n\n\nPlanned Features/Improvements in the Future:\n\n- Give users the option to select their native currency, so that you’ll be brought to the most relevant page for a cryptocurrency on Yahoo Finance when switching. As an example, if you switch from the Robinhood page for Bitcoin (https://robinhood.com/crypto/BTC) it will always bring you to the USD version of that page (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD). We want to give users who do not use USD as their native fiat currency to have the option to send themselves to their preferred page, such as https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-CAD for Canadians, for example. \n\n- Add better handling for tickers which are available on one site, but not the other. For example – at the time of this writing, Trulieve Cannabis Corp (TCNNF) has its own page on Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TCNNF), but is not available on Robinhood at all, so using the extension to switch to Robinhood will result in a 404 page. We want to implement some cleaner way of handling this: possibly by sending the user straight to the other website’s homepage, and using an alert to explain why this happened. Exact solution TBD. \n\n- Building off of the previous point, we’d like to add some method of collecting data in instances where the extension fails to switch the user to their desired page. For example, having the extension send us the url of any failed attempts to open a particular page would be very helpful. In the meantime, if you encounter any pages which do not allow you to switch between these two sites as you would expect to, we’d greatly appreciate it if you could send an email with the url that you tried to use the extension on to tickerswitcher@gmail.com. This may never be 100% perfect (as we’re kind of at the whim of whatever unusual choices Robinhood and Yahoo Finance might decide to make with their page and url structure), but we do want this extension to work as consistently as possible, so if there are any instances where it’s failing, we’d really like to know! \n\n- We want to expand the extension to work with other finance websites. Obviously, not everyone uses Robinhood, and not everyone uses Yahoo Finance. We’d like to get the extension working on as many finance websites as possible, and give users the ability to customize which sites they can switch between. Again, if there are any particular websites (or additional features) that you’d like to see us add, please send an email to tickerswitcher@gmail.com to let us know! Some of the top sites on our to-do list include: \n--- Seeking Alpha\n--- Google Finance\n--- TradingView"
