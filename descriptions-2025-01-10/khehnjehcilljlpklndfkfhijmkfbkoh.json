It adds relevant labels to comments, allowing better organization and communication among team members. Additionally, it prevents changing the default merge strategy of a pull request, ensuring a consistent workflow. Simplify your team's collaboration and make your Bitbucket experience more efficient with this useful extension.\n\n1.1.0 | 2023-04-18\nRelease\n\n1.1.1 | 2023-05-26\nBugfixes\n- Updated HTML query selector due to Bitbucket's HTML structure changes, which prevents the evaluation of null variables and avoids causing blocking errors.\n- Handled the case of deleted comments, which previously stopped the extension from working properly.\n\n1.1.2 | 2023-10-10\nBugfixes\n- Fixed HTML query selectors and general inconsistencies.\n- Unlabeled comments made before the release date are no longer censored.\n- Comment buttons (Reply, Resolve, Edit...) are now rendered correctly, respecting comment decorations. e.g. It is not possible to create an issue for a non-blocking comment.\n\nFeatures\n- Logs might be displayed in the user's console, both at startup and on error.\n- All types of selectors are stored on a remote server, making it much easier and faster to fix an HTML selector when Bitbucket changes its structure.\n\nTODOs\n- Enable extension for side-by-side and entire views (these options are available in each file's horizontal kebab menu)."
