Should anyone wish to take this extension over, please contact the developer.\n\nWarframe Info Centre is a lightweight and easy to use extension for keeping you up-to-date of all the latest alerts and invasions in the game WARFRAME, even when you're not logged in to the game.\n\nThis extension was born of a desire to never miss important alerts like that Vauban systems you can't seem to get, or the ever elusive Orokin Catalyst. With sound and desktop notifications built-in, it'll be hard to miss that one blueprint you're after while browsing the web, or letting your computer idle in the other room.\n\nPlease be aware that WIC is still in beta, and as such some features will be unavailable or buggy initially, but updates will continue to be provided over time, extending functionality and adding new features.\n\nWorks for PC, PS4, and Xbox One."
