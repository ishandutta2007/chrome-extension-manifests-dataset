These input methods don't require you to input tones, making it very easy to type the correct characters without knowing the correct tones. These input methods also tend to remember your frequently used words or suggest complete phrases, which is not helpful for language learners.\n\nBy requiring you to enter tones along with Pinyin spellings before displaying characters, ToneBoard lets you practice recalling the correct tone for each syllable whenever you type.\n\nToneBoard works very similarly to the standard simplified Chinese Pinyin input method, except that it requires tones to be input while typing before displaying word and character choices."
