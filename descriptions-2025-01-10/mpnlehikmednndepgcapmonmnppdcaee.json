Share a found link with us or just store it on Linkerhub instead of keeping it among your open tabs.\n\nThis widget is a helper to simplify obtaining the information about the page the user is currently on. All the widget does is fetching current page info from Linkerhub database and provides to the user all available to Linkerhub information, including users' rating, link title and short description of the page.\n\nIf the page is not present in the Linkerhub's database, user will be prompted to add it, which can be conveniently made with the widget."
