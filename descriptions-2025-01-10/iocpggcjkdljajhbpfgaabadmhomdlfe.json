This way instead of guessing at your impact you can actually know the most eco friendly purchases. Who new beef emitted so much co2??  pretty cool...\n\nSuggest improvements in review section pls. thanks\n\nCool Improvements Planned:\n        Co2 emissions will get even more accurate as we add some Machine Learning into the program. This will also expand the # of products we have a co2 calculation for.  *insert applause and amazement. \"woah... crazy...\"\n\nBoring but Kinda Important Details:\n       Works on Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods and Instacart. \n       This is just v1, so enhancements to come. \n       Data sourced from Our World in Data(dataset) on Co2 emissions of food."
