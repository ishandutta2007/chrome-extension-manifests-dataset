For example, you can share your Walmart cart with family to help them pick out holiday gifts. By making sure the recipient receives the exact cart items, there is never confusion about what items need to be purchased.\n\nQ: Who can I send Amazon cart to?\nA: Using our extension, it is possible to send Amazon cart with anyone (including yourself)! Keep in mind: if you make changes to your shopping cart, generate a new link with our extension to share the updated items.\n\nQ: What are the differences between an Amazon wishlist and this extension?\nA: Currently, it is not possible to move all items from an Amazon wishlist to a shopping cart easily. With Share Carts you can send someone your entire shopping cart directly, removing the hassle of manual transfer. Another downside of an Amazon wishlist is it doesn't support moving the exact quantities to a cart. Share Carts solves both these issues, making it a great alternative to using a traditional wishlist.\n\nQ: Where else can I share my cart?\nA: In addition to Amazon & Walmart we support top online stores such as: Best Buy, IKEA, Instacart, Newegg, and more. Please reach out if you want to suggest a new store for us to support.\n\nQ: Is it possible to export my cart to a spreadsheet?\nA: Yes, using our \"Export CSV\" feature, you can export your cart. The attributes included in the CSV: product title, product url, quantity, and price.  You can open the cart CSV file in Excel (or any spreadsheet software).\n\nüÜì It is free to use Share Carts, and no registration is required to use our extension.\n\n‚û§ Share Carts is not related or endorsed by the stores supported in this extension."
