It was built for multitaskers who often find themselves with many unrelated tabs open. With it you‚Äôll be able to easily switch between tasks and tabs while staying focused and keeping your chrome session clean.\n\n- It‚Äôs recommend to pin the extension in the extensions menu but you can also open it with Ctrl+M (MacCtrl+Command+M).\n- Most of the features are accessed by context menus: try right clicking groups, saved groups and tabs.\n\nüìö Some of the features:\n\n- Group all tabs on a window;\n- Save a group as a bookmark folder (saved under the folder ‚ÄúTab Groups‚Äù);\n- Drag tabs in/out of tab groups;\n- Copy or download the tab groups URLs;\n- Rename a tab group by double clicking it;\n- Close, ungroup or delete tab groups.\n\n---\nThe extension is open source and does not collect any sort of data. \n\nüì¶ You can check the source code here: https://github.com/FernandoLins8/Tab-Groups-to-Bookmarks\n\n---\nFeel free to message me any feedback. \n\n‚òï You can also buy me a coffee if you want to support the extension development. Thanks in advance.\n\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/fernandolins"
