If you design them in Canva or Adobe Express, this service is available there as well. Simply search for 'labels' in Canva Apps and Adobe Express Add-ons.\n\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nRight-click on an empty space on a web page, scroll down the popup menu, and select the newly added menu item: “Print your own labels and stickers”\n\nYou will see two options:\n\n1 - \"Upload label design(s)\"\nThis option asks you to upload one or more label designs from your computer and then print them on labels.\n\n2 - \"Print the QR code of this page\" \nThis option generates the QR code of that page and immediately allows you to print it on labels. If you need to download the QR code image, just click on it.\nIf you right-click over a .jpg, .png or .webp online image on any web page, you will see another option: \"Print this image on labels\" which allows you to print that image on labels.\n\nAfter selecting the label sheet template of your choice and clicking the Print button, this extension will generate a PDF file where images are laid out exactly as defined by the template. You can either print directly from the browser or save the PDF file on your computer and open it in Adobe Reader to print from there.\nBecause browsers have different predefined print settings, ensure there are no extra margins and always select \"Actual size\" when printing. Alternatively, you can download the PDF file and print it from a PDF reader.\n\n\nWHY THIS EXTENSION\n\nTo this day, DIY printing on labels and stickers is done through either Word processing templates or proprietary software. Users are tied up to one system and often to one label maker's brand only.\nThis extension is a universal DIY label printing tool that can be used by anyone, anywhere, without the need for any software or template downloads. You can upload and print any label design, regardless of its source. \n\nAdditionally, you can directly print the QR code of any web page. QR code generators simply give you the QR image file. If you need to print that image on labels or stickers, you are on your own. The best that some of them do is give you a long list of instructions on how to find and use a few other software systems. Because QR codes are images, this extension helps you print them as well.\n\nBlank label sheets are sold in office supply stores. If your preferred brand is not supported yet, just let us know.\n\nThis service is free and unlimited. Frequent users will start getting a small watermark, which can be removed by subscribing to a paid plan.\n\n\nYOUR PRIVACY\n\nWe are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This extension does not collect personal data and does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you."
