Find this project on GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft tries very hard to make us love and use their new browser, Edge, and their awful search engine Bing; going as far as to make it very difficult for Windows 10 and 11 users to use anything else.\n\nTurn the tide with Chrometana Pro, a chrome extension forcing Windows and Cortana to use Google Chrome and your favorite search engine instead of Edge and Bing.  Pick between Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and Baidu.  Chrometana Pro also makes it very easy for you to add your own search engine and customize if Bing and/or Cortana requests will use your favorite search engine instead.\n\nChrometana Pro came along to fill the gap left by the original Chrometana extension whose author has abandoned the project.\n\nLeave me feedback :D\nI'd love to know what you think ;)\n\nChangelog:\nv2.3 - Fixes to redirection blocking in edge and chrome\nv2.0 - Redesigned menu + renewed support for windows 10 and 11 with the wedge open-source edge deflector\nv1.7 - Snazzy new logo\nv1.6 - Fixed extension not redirecting from bing when chrome hasn't yet been opened\nv1.4/v1.5 - (No chrome update) Firefox \"Foxtana Pro\" releases\nv1.3 - Improved size of menu text\nv1.2 - Fixed search counter counting up too quickly\nv1.1 - Fixes to the install tutorial page\nv1.0 - Initial Version\n\n☎ Contact me at extensions@guiselin.com\n★★★★★ Rate this extension"
