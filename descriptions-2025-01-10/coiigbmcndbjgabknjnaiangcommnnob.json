Downloading only the selected files is currently only possible for music albums. If you want to do the same for photos one workaround is to add the selected photos to a new (temporary) album and then download that.\n\nPatchnotes:\n- v1.1\n  Changed file name of TV Episodes to format 'Series name - SxxExx - episode name.format'\n- v1.0\n  First official release.\n- v0.9\n  Fixed download of photo albums.\n- v0.8\n  The extension now matches host \"app.plex.tv\" and path \"/web/index.html\" to try and not be in your face on pages that have nothing to do with Plex.\n- v0.7\n  Added path match \"desktop\" because the host app.plex.tv isn't using the same path as the self hosted version.\n- v0.6\n  The downloads are now queued in a background script so they will continue even if the active tab is changed. Also rewriting file/pathnames to not conflict with Windows path restrictions.\n- v0.5\n  The Extension is now restricted to tabs with the path \"web/index.html\" so it won't be in your face all the time.\n- v0.4\n  Added support for libraries that were shared with you.\n- v0.3\n  Fixed download link so it will also download pictures not just music.\n- v0.2\n  Fixed broken manifest.json\n- v0.1\n  First version."
