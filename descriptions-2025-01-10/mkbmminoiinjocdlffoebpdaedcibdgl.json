Most of the time, the sender and receiver have different viewpoints over the same text, mostly because of assumptions and missing cues to convey the intent.\n\nTo address this gap and promote mindfulness in our daily digital life, we introduce the system to reduce ambiguity and unknowns and encourage users to provide more information cues to convey the message.\n\nWe did this by combining thoughtful content formats and gamification. This platform enables attention to thoughts, feelings, and mental judgments our minds make in everyday aspects of digital social life.\n\n👨‍💻 🔨 How It Works ⚙️. 👩‍💻\n\nWe are identifying our platform users as \"Markers.\" Our users mark their thought while engaging and creating remarks to express their minds.\n\nEach user will provide monthly \"Marker Points\" to reward deserving authors.\n\n✍️ You create remarks. Find an audience for your thoughts. Build a community on\nyour terms.\n✋ Earn Marker Points.\n✌ Platform users decide the winner.\n🎁 Win Challenges & Exciting Prizes.\n\n🧰 🧰 Platform UtilitIes 🧰 🧰\n\n📎 Extension to collect save ideas and information from the web.\n📚 Save Kindle Highlights and Notes. You can save multiple versions.\n✔️ 🔄 Productivity tools - A unique approach to the To-Do list.\nRememist, Lastist utility apps.\n\nI invite you all to explore what we have to offer in youremarks.com and share your feedback.\n\n🚀🚀🚀 Launch day Promo. 🎁 🎁 🎁\n\nThe first 1000 early users stand a chance to win a cool gadget — $500 worth.\n\nIf we are lucky, we plan to extend this promo to an increment of every 5K early users."
