This extension is tab specific. Hence, one tab can be made louder or quieter than another. If you don't want to boost the volume or return to your default settings, simply slide the slider all the way to the left (the green zone). If the volume is not being boosted, simply refresh the page.\n\nPlease be careful when you slide the slider to the red zone. \nI am not liable for any damage caused to your speakers or earphones.\n\nThis extension will remain free to use indefinitely.\nNO ADVERTS! NO POP-UPS! NO MALWARE!"
