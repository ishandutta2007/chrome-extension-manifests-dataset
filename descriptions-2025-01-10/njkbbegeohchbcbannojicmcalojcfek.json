With our extension, you'll be able to create a task list and use the built-in pomodoro timer to break your work into manageable chunks and stay focused during each session.\n\nBut that's not all - our extension also includes a blacklist feature that allows you to specify websites that tend to distract you. Set a time limit for blacklisted sites, and you'll receive notifications, vibrations, or zaps as a reminder to stay on task. \n\nAnd if you're someone who tends to keep a lot of tabs open, our extension also includes a tab management feature to send you stimuli when you open too many tabs, helping you to reduce clutter and improve focus.\n\nThis extension works without the Pavlok device, but you'll only receive chrome notifications. Create a Pavlok account by downloading the app (https://pavlok.com/app) or creating it on the web ( https://app.pavlok.com/users/sign_up )"
