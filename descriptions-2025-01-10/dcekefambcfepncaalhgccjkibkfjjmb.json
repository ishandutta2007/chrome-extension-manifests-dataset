Well, probably not. It's fun to try out though!\n\n\nFeatures:\n- Highlight text!\n- Right clicking!\n- Clicking a button on a context menu!\n- Irritating voice!\n- Free money!* \n- Open Source! https://github.com/LiamSorta/TextToHelium\n\nI made this since I've never done JS before and I felt like making something.\nSome self-promotion links:\nhttps://github.com/LiamSorta\nhttps://twitter.com/LiamSorta\n\n* - No actual free money."
