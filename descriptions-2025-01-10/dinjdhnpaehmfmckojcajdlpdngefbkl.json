But hate getting caught when using it for work or school? This chrome extension can help you hide your usage of Chatgpt. It does so by having a very small and non Chatgpt looking pop-up at the top. This small pop-up will not draw attention and is much less likely to be spotted than the Chatgpt app. This extension also allows you to quickly minimize the pop-up and keep it out of sight when you need to get back to work. With this chrome extension, you can enjoy using Chatgpt without worrying about getting caught."
