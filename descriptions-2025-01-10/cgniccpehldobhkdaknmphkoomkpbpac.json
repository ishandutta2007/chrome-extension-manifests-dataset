It not only removes the Archive button from the Yahoo Mail toolbar, but it also shifts the Delete button back to where it used to be, until the Archive button took its place.\n\nMany long-time Yahoo Mail users have expressed displeasure at the Archive button; not so much at its existence, but at its placement.  Yahoo put the Archive button where the Delete button used to be, causing many users frustration when they accidentally archive emails that they want to delete.\n\nThis extension makes Yahoo Mail look (and act) like it did before the addition of the Archive button.\n\nThe exact pixel count will vary by device, so if the Delete button appears too far one way or another, fill out a form on the Support tab and I'll try to get it squared away for your device.\n\nv1.0.1:\n  - fixed \"Uncaught TypeError\" when archive button not present"
