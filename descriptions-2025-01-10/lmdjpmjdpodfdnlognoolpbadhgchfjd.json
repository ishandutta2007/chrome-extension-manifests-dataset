Streaming services. Music and photos. Amazon seamlessly provides it all. Now, if you’ve been longing to donate more to your charities and causes you care about, you’ll really enjoy how easy Amazon is making it for you to give back. Millions of people shop on this convenient platform each day. With Amazon Smile, you can now donate 0.5% of your purchases to the charitable partner of your choice.\n\nBut here’s the thing. In order for your purchase to qualify, it needs to be made through the Amazon Smile domain, smile.amazon.com. Any purchase qualifies so long as it is made through this link and not the normal Amazon.com domain. \n\nWe know you have a lot to keep track of, so we decided to make it easier for you by developing a Chrome extension that automatically redirects you to the Amazon Smile link so a percentage of your Amazon purchase can go toward a supported charity. That’s it. It’s easy, free, automatic. If you have any questions, check out our FAQ section, or click below to download our Google Chrome extension.\n\n1. Install Makemesmile\nChrome extensions make your online experience more convenient and the Makemesmile extension is no different. Just click here to install the browser extension in seconds. No pop-ups or additional sign-ups required.\n\n2. Turn Shopping Into Donations\nOnce the extension is downloaded, you can then select your charity or organization of choice to turn your shopping into donations. Amazon Smile partners with charitable organizations possessing a 501(c)(3) status that are located in the U.S. and its surrounding territories. \n\nFAQ\nDo you collect any private data?\nNo. While this is a free tool there is no catch and we don’t collect information on your shopping habits or any other personal data.\n\nDo I need to sign up?\nUsing coupons is always free, no login required. However, we encourage you to take advantage of some of the features that come along with a user account. You can set up email alerts for your favorite stores, participate in our Pays-2-Share program by entering coupons, and even manage promotional content for your own online business.\nCash Back offers always require an account to redeem offers and monitor payment status. The Scout Chrome Extension does not require an account, except to activate cash back offers.\n\nDo charities get to keep the full .5%?\nYes. Amazon pays all expenses of the AmazonSmile Foundation. No extra fees are deducted from your donation amount generated by purchases on AmazonSmile.\n\nHow can I submit a coupon?\nVisit our Submit a Coupon page and enter the store's url along with the discount and coupon code. If you're logged in and are enrolled in the Pays-2-Share program, you'll earn money every time someone uses your coupons (from participating stores)"
