It saves public details (location, education, job title) of the members and show in a dashboard for you to analyse. Thus you can understand more about your community demographics and share more useful content. \nThe best thing is you can also save answers given by members when they ask to join your facebook group. Saving those answers was a big pain us and soon we realised it’s a big pain for all other admins. That’s why we created 2Bound."
