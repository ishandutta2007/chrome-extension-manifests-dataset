Together, many organizations are developing a specification to make your browser do that for you and tell the websites that you don't want to get tracked.\n\nThis extension enables GPC, so every site that implements it will not bother you anymore. So far only a limited set of ~1000 websites like The NY Times or DuckDuckGo implement this feature, but it is a matter of time that this specification grows and becomes an standard.\n\nLet's fix the Web together.\n\nYou can check if you have GPC enabled at: https://global-privacy-control.glitch.me/"
