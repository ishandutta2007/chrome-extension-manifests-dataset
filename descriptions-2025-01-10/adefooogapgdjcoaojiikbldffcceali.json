It’s 100% free to install and use. \n\nWe take any advertising profits that we earn from Yahoo's advertisers and split them with our partner, OneTreePlanted.org. \n\nIf you try it and you don't like it, you can remove it at any time by typing \"chrome://extensions/\" into your search bar.\n\n\n🔑 What about Privacy? 🔑\n\nWe do not track you. \n\nIn fact, we specifically don’t want a single bit of personal information. We just need to take your search query, encrypt it and send it to Yahoo! to get your search results.\n\n\n🌱 So How Do I Start Growing Trees Today? 🌱\n\nJust click the “Add To Chrome” button! \n\nGive it a try, add this extension and know that every search is helping to change the world. If you don't like it, you can remove it at any time! \n\n\n🙋‍♀️ I Still Have Questions 🙋‍♀️\n\nPlease feel free to reach out anytime: support@greentreesearch.com. Or reach out to us on facebook.com/GreenTreeSearch."
