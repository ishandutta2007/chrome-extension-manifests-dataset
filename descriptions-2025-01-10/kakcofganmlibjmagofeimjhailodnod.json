Open your browser and reach out to the professionals: PINBUSTERS!\nOur courteous and efficient extension is on call 24 hours a day to serve all your Pin elimination needs.\n\nWe're ready to bust your pins!\n\n======================\n\nBut.. \nWhat does it do?\n\nThis extension hides all Pinterest images that appear in your Google Image Search. Well, technically it creates an overlay with Pinbusters logo on top of them, so that you know where *not to* click. \n\nHowever, you can still click that image, and you will see the expanded image panel in its original form, with the \"pinned\" image displayed and original functionality available.\n\nTry it out for yourself!\n\n================\n\nHere's the Github repo: https://github.com/bzx/pinbusters\nIf you think you can make it better, pull requests are welcome!"
