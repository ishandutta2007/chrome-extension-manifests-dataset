This extension is designed for developers, it is not for general users. This extension is free and comes with no support or guaranty. You can design your software around this e.g. software that accepts WhatsApp messages or even send WhatsApp messages. Don't use this for bulk messaging or spamming - otherwise you will be blocked by WhatsApp. :) \n\nSummary:\n\nThis extension captures your https://web.whatsapp.com data (incoming messages) and passes to URL (server) in a JSON format. It also looks for new messages on the server every 15 mins and sends those messages to contacts listed on WhatsApp.\n\nAPI documentation: https://links.zaperp.com/whatsappapi \n\nHere is how API works:\n\nPush WhatsApp Message To ZapERP.\n\nMake sure - In the chrome extension you have added a URL ( https://yourdomain.com/api ). Extension will then automatically POST data to ( https://yourdomain.com/api/apps/sms/whatsapp ) - along with message source phone details and actual message contents.\n\nYou can also use your own format of URL e.g. https://yourdomain.com/myworld but then end point is \"https://yourdomain.com/myworld/apps/sms/whatsapp\" . So it is important that your server can accept this endpoint POST request from outside.\n\n\nPull messages from your server:\n\nNow, extension automatically pings your server for new messages. In this case, expected end point is: https://yourdomain.com/api/apps/sms/whatsapp . For the message and JSON format, please refer POSTMAN documentation link https://links.zaperp.com/whatsappapi  . \n\nHope this helps. Thanks."
