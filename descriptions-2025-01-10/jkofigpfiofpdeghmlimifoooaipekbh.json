With Cepter, you can easily intercept network requests and modify their response body, status, or headers.\n\nCepter is a devtool that adds a dev-tool panel to the Chrome browser. To start using the extension, open chrome-devtools side-panel, Open the Cepter panel, and click \"connect to tab\" to begin debugging the page. Once connected, turn on \"record network requests\" to see all the network requests made to the page, either through refreshing or interacting with it.\n\nTo create an interception, click \"add interception\" or use one of the network requests to base your interception on. \n\nName your new interception and select the interception type - \"Replace\" is the commonly used option, while \"Merge\" is an advanced option relevant mainly for XHR JSON requests. With Merge, you can combine the body of the original response with the one you provide.\n\nChoose a response method such as GET or POST and ensure that the URL regex pattern is accurate.\n\nTo control the new response's status or body, edit the JSON. It is essential to ensure that the JSON format of the response is valid to save your changes successfully.\n\nAfter creating one or more interceptions, refresh the page or trigger the network requests you want to intercept. Your changes should be applied based on the rules you defined."
