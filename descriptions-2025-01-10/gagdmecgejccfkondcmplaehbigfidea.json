However, without an explicit 'report-sample' value for certain directives, the reports might (the behaviour is browser-dependent at the moment) look indistinguishable for different kinds of violations (e.g., inline handlers vs. inline scripts vs. javascript URIs for script-src).\n\nThe keyword 'report-sample', when specified for certain CSP directives, makes compliant browsers include the first 40 characters of the code that caused the violation in the report that is POSTed to the report-uri endpoint.\n\nBy injecting 'report-sample' where it is missing, if report-uri is present, this addon aims to help developers understand which portion of the website code is responsible for the violation(s)."
