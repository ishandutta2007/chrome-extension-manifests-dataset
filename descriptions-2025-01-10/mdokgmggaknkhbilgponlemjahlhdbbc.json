You will be surprised at how much you can read and comprehend by focusing on the beginning.\n\nIn the world of speed reading, a common advice is to read the bold text, which is the gist of the text and the most important information. The theory is that you can read twice as fast this way.\n\nRead twice as fast by emphasizing the beginning of the words. Your brain will do the rest."
