Click the \"Add to Chrome\" button over that way ‚§¥Ô∏è  to install this software and then you will no longer have to click \"Admit\" button. Instead people will be *automatically* allowed to enter the meeting without having to wait to be admitted. \n\nThis software is a real time saver because you won't have to fumble around finding the Admit button for every meeting straggler and can keep your focus on the actual meeting. \n\nThis software is pre-configured to work with English because it watches for a popup button with the word \"Admit\". If you are using Google Meet in a different language, then after installing, click the extension icon (which looks like a puzzle piece), then scroll down to Meet Auto Admit and click the the 3 dot menu and then select \"options\" . This will display a page where you change the button text to match your language. Then it will auto admit users in non-English. \n\nIf you want to join a meeting without having to remember to click the \"Join\" button, then please install the extension \"Auto join for Google Meet\". It is a nice companion extension that also makes video meeting easier and faster.  \n\nBONUS: Webinars are now one click easy to record! When viewing a webinar page a RECORD button will be available making it a snap to record the webinar and have the video sent to you afterwards. Never miss another webinar!\n\nüôè ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis software is provided by Zoomcorder.com where you can record any Zoom, GoToWebinar or Google Meet or Microsoft Teem meeting WITHOUT ATTENDING and get a video sent to you to watch later. It's highly useful so give it a try. \n\nSpecial thanks to the original author L√°szl√≥ Terray for his quality work. \n\nNow click \"Add to Chrome\" in the upper right corner to immediately experience the goodness of this free and useful software!"
