When running a Kiosk, or Digital Signage - the ability the quickly reload the page is essential. This plugin does exactly that.\n\nThis is not a replacement for correcting problems in the first place (memory leaks especially) and isn't particularly useful in an everyday environment, where you can simply press the refresh button yourself.\n\nThis is a copy of another extension Oh No You Didn't!, with some minor additions, in that it will also reload all the tabs after 30 minutes. This was to tackle an edge case of poorly performing kiosk devices, displaying sites prone to memory leakage.\n\nYou can also click the icon in the toolbar to see when the next crash check and reload are anticipated... I say \"anticipated\" as with these relying on the javascript setInterval method, other things may affect when the code will really execute."
