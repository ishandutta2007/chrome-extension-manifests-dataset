Get a quick view of your GitHub/GitLab Issue activity, Stack Overflow activity, and much more...\n\nFeatures: \n\n* Getting started with Initab is easy. Open the SETTINGS panel and configure your preferences. CUSTOM LINKS are a popular (optional) feature that you might consider activating. Simply add some valid URLs or Markdown URLs to the CUSTOM LINKS section in the SETTINGS panel. The DATE & TIME section then gets replaced with your custom links. Don’t forget to try the optional TAB LIMITING feature. It automatically keeps your browser tabs limited to the number you choose by closing older tabs. Some like it, some don’t…so be careful.\n\n* Do you find yourself constantly hunting around for the GitHub Issue or Pull Request you're currently working on? Initab pulls your GitHub activity directly from your history, so you don't have to worry about closing the tab associated with that issue and/or pull request. Simply open a new tab and you'll see the item right there in your GitHub Issue/PR Activity.\n\n* Oh, you don't use GitHub? You're more of the GitLab type, huh? Well, Initab has you covered! Quickly toggle between GitHub and GitLab as your preferred Issue and Pull/Merge Request tracker.\n\n* Whoops! You accidentally closed the tab with the Stack Overflow answer that could help you out of the mess you’re in… Don’t worry, Initab has you covered there too. Click this button to toggle the Stack Overflow panel which is populated with all of your recent S.O. history.\n\n* Cover all your browser history bases with the RELEVANT HISTORY section. Do you want to see articles or blog posts you've visited related to a specific technology? Add a keyword in the RELEVANT HISTORY section in the SETTINGS panel.\n\n* Do you have a favorite SubReddit for the technology you love to work with? Add your preferred r/… in the SETTINGS panel, in order to keep tabs on whats going on in Reddit today.\n\n* If you prefer to use RSS feeds to get your news, we've got you covered. You can switch your FEED PROVIDER in SETTINGS to GOOGLE ALERTS.\n\n* Do you need quick access to your commonly used code snippets that you have available in your Gist account? Simply enter your GitHub username and Initab will fetch all public Gists related to your account.\n\n* Keep up to date with the hot new GitHub repos for the technology that you’re interested in. Trending New Repos fetches the most starred GitHub repositories that were created in the last month.\n\n* Scratch Pad - a super simple note taking app that is available to you with every new tab you open.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n9/21/2023 - Latest 2.0.6 - 2.0.7 Release Notes:\n\n* Removed Problematic Code That Triggered Warning\n\n9/3/2023 - Latest 2.0.1 - 2.0.5 Release Notes:\n\n* UX Improvements\n* Minor Text Updates\n* Bug Fixes\n\n8/13/2023 - Latest 2.0.0 Release Notes:\n\n* This is a huge update where Initab has been rewritten from the ground up.
