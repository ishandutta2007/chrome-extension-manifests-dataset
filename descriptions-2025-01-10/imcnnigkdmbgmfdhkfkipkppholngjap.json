And sometimes you don't even remember how you got there!\n\nWill Save is a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome. Once installed, link your Duolingo account to receive potions for each lesson you complete. Trade in potions to spend time on time-wasting sites you've added to your blocklist.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Do I need to give you my duolingo password?\nA: Not at all. You simply tell the extension what your duolingo username is, and it will pull your exp info from the public API.\n\nQ: How can I tweak how many minutes I get per potion, or how many exp per potion?\nA: In the extension settings (Chrome: chrome://extensions > Will-Save > Settings, Firefox: Tools > Addons) you can customize these two settings. By default you get 1 potion per 10XP and 10 minutes per potion.\n\nQ: Will I be credited for lessons I do on the Duolingo apps?\nA: Yes! Because the extension looks at Duolingo's API, anytime you're credited with EXP you will be able to use it.\n\nQ: Does it cost money?\nA: Nope. No ads either. The amount of time it's saved me is well worth my effort."
