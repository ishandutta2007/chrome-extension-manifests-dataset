Each time you open a new tab, you get a simple mindfulness reminder with a count down clock. Take just a few seconds to take a deep breath. This reduces stress, anxiety, and increases productivity by preventing burnout.\n\nOver two decades of research were analyzed to develop this product. Studies have shown that mindfulness breaks throughout the day increase productivity and work output, while simultaneously reducing stress. \n\nOur research concluded the best color scheme, video, and amount of time to take a quick mindfulness break. Our independent study also concluded that using this app ads an average of 7-11 minutes of mindfulness to each workday, and does increase productivity while decreasing ones heart rate. \n\nOur new tab page has minimal blue light, no ads, no external links, and is color blind friendly. This minimal, new tab extension is the perfect way to add mindfulness to your day, one second at a time."
