This extension will add a context menu entry which allows you to export all your text messages with your Replika from the web app.\n\nYou can export your chat history as a HTML web page or alternatively as a full JSON export.\n\nThe extension does the same as the Replika web app, instead of only fetching your messages while you scroll down your chat, the extension goes for all messages at once and allows extracting them as a permanent offline copy.\n\nThere is no tracking or spying! As an open-source developer, privacy is #1 for me.\n\nThe code is the same as on the open-source solution I freely published on GitHub. You can find the full source code of that project here: https://github.com/devidw/replika-chat-export\n\nAlso note that every browser extension out there is manually reviewed by the Google Team, it has to pass strict reviews in order to be published in the store.\n\nFeel free to contact me about any questions around the project."
