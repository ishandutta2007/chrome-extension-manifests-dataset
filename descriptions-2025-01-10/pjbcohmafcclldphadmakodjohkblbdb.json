Especially if you are new to photo editing, the learning curve can be steep. It can take a long time to edit your photo, especially if you are on-the-go. While Lightroomâ€™s powerful editing tools can be essential when you are sitting in front of your laptop or desktop, they can be difficult to access if you are editing on your smartphone. \n\nThis is where Lightroom mobile presets come in handy. They offer quick and easy photo editing through a one-click preset on your smartphone. All of us at Parker Arrow completed the pre-coloring for you, so you simply need to select the appropriate Lightroom filter and you are good to go."
