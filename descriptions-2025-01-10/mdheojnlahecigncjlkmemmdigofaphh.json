The number is now in your clipboard ready to paste.\n\nYou can also use the extension on the top right to paste anything to have it strip all characters except numbers. Just paste in the field and press Enter, then it is in your clipboard.\n\nThis is my first Chrome Extension. I am still learning how things work. I needed this functionality to easily copy phone numbers from my Google Contacts without having to deal with removing characters and paste into my VOIP system to dial out. I hope you like it."
