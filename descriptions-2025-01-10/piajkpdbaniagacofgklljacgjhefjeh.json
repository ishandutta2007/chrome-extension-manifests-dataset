Individuals around the world can now be protected from profanity in their homes, organizations, and schools. APF has a variety of options to meet your personal needs.\n\nAPF is not limited to filtering text alone! With the use of captions and subtitles it can also mute audio while you sit back and relax to watch your favorite movies and shows from a collection of supported sites. Have a suggestion for a new supported site? Contact us!\n\nFor a detailed overview of the features and settings, please see the Getting Started page here:\n\nhttps://github.com/FrostCo/AdvancedProfanityFilter/wiki\n\nThank you for supporting the ongoing development of this project."
