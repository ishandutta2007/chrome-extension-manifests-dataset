The whole idea behind 1 click 1 cite is quite obvious.  Itâ€™s in the name, it takes away the hassle of having to open other windows, go to other websites, and the general pain that comes from citing sources for a bibliography.  The advantage of using the extension is pure simplicity.    This is achieved by simply clicking the extension, and the extension popup appearing with the citation formatted, copied, and ready for the user.  \n\nThe interface reflects one style, simplicity.  The whole selling point of the extension is that it is as minimal clicks as possible.  This is a hot trend in the software industry, as the easier it is for users to complete their task, the more likely they will use that program.  This minimality is quite evident, as there is literally one button to click for the program to work, and one switch where the user can choose the citation type."
