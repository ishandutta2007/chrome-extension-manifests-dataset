No more hanging out on Teams/Slack, wondering if anyone will answer your questions.\n\nHere’s what you can do with the Metaphor Extension :\n\n⏵ Investigate trust signals about the dashboard: Get an immediate view of any official certification tags your enterprise data team might have created to indicate the trustworthiness of the report you are looking at.\n\n⏵ Communicate with authoritative data team members: Request access, get clarifications, or generally ask a question and know that the right people in your enterprise’s data team will get back to you.\n\n⏵ See how your colleagues use the dashboard: See other conversations your team members or others across your enterprise have had about this dashboard - collaborate across silos."
