This extension now supports only pure HTML and CSS. I will be working on creating a version using sandbox so inline JS can run.\n\nTryit Editor is a HTML code editor that included syntax highlighting and multiple functions. This is a branch off of tryiteditor.webs.com, which is the main site for this application.\n\nI'm looking on fixing some minor bugs next version, as well as customizing key bindings. I don't want to implement the JavaScript in such a way that there is only one execution block and 2 editors - one for JS, one for HTML.\n\n=====================================\n\nCHANGELOG:\n5/15/13 - Fixed icon background transparency\n\n1/13/13 - lock feature removed, added about section in options. Attempted to make JavaScript work, but Chrome returned the message that it \"Refused to execute script because source code of script found within request.\" Still thinking about how to make this work\n\n1/11/13 - fixed a TON of bugs. Sorry about not having time early, I'm in high school.\n\n9/20/12 - manifest_version 2 broke the application. Should be fixed now WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JAVASCRIPT SUPPORT.\n\n7/8/12 - Updated so using manifest_version 2 now. Shouldn't affect user experience.\n\n2/24/12 - Added filesystem controls in beta. Enable them in Options.\n\n2/23/12 - First version!"
