It gives you a dark page, no matter what!\n\nImprovements from Nicer Inverter:\n● Dark-ifies pages aggressively, so you're much less likely to come across pages with bright patches.\n● Dark-ifies pages *by default*, so you don't need to click the extension's button on every page load.\n● Allows you to toggle dark styles on and off without reloading the page.\n● Optionally darkens photos and media embeds.\n\nThere are a lot of inverters out there, and many of them are great. I'm using Dark Reader[1] right now, and honestly, it's better than this for most use cases. BUT! Some pages on the internet are dark by default. When you invert a dark page, it becomes light. AGH MY EYES!\n\nThis extension will *always* give you a dark background.\n\nYou can change the default theme from \"Dark\" to \"Light\" by going to Tools -> Extensions and clicking the \"Options\" link under Dark Theme Everywhere. You can toggle the theme with a hotkey by going to Tools -> Extensions and clicking the \"Keyboard shortcuts\" link at the bottom.\n\nNow that your browser is nice and dark-themed, you might notice an annoying white flash between pages. It's a known bug that's being tracked in Issue 1373[2] and Issue 126341[3]. I wrote another extension to reduce the flicker[4], but the problem will exist to some degree until it's fixed in Chromium.\n\nEnjoy!
