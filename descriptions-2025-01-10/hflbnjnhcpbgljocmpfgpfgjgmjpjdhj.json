Our extension is designed to help you spot and avoid these manipulative tactics by detecting common types of dark patterns like misdirection, social proof, forced action, urgency, and scarcity.\n\nWith our extension, all the text on any website you visit is automatically scanned using a TinyBERT model, which is specifically fine-tuned to detect these dark patterns. When something suspicious is found, the extension highlights the problematic text, making it easy for you to see where a site might be trying to manipulate you.\n\nOur main goal is to help you browse the web more safely and confidently by identifying these hidden tactics. We believe that by making these dark patterns visible, we can empower users like you to make smarter, more informed decisions while shopping or navigating online.\n\nTo learn more about dark patterns and how our extension works, check out our website here: https://dark-pattern-detector.xyz/."
