While it can be useful for learning about new pages and people it can also be very distracting. This chrome extension removes the \"For you\" feed from Twitter and thus, only enables users to see the \"Following\" feed which consists of posts from people they follow. Therefore, the overall purpose of this extension is to give users more control over their Twitter feeds so that they don't waste time on algorithmically generated content which is very engaging in nature."
