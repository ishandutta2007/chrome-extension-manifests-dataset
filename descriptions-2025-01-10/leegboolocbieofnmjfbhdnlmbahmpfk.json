This extension modifies the underlying code to re-enable PiP, allowing you to use PiP on sites where it's been blocked.\n\nImportant Note:\nThis extension does not include a built-in pop-out player. To watch videos in PiP mode on browsers like Google Chrome, you'll need to install a separate extension that provides this feature.\n\nKey Features:\n\nRestores PiP Functionality: Bypass the disablepictureinpicture attribute on websites, giving you back control of your viewing experience.\nSimple and Focused: This extension does one thing—re-enabling PiP mode in the JavaScript code—and does it efficiently.\nComplementary Tool: Pair this extension with a dedicated PiP player extension for full functionality on browsers like Google Chrome.\n\nDownload Enable PiP Mode today and take back the PiP capability on your favorite sites.\n\nTested in Chrome and Opera"
