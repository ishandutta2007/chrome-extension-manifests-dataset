We know we should check the sender address and make sure it's correct.\n\nThis plugin helps with this idea.  It looks at the sender's email address and compares it to any links in the email.  If any information looks off or is unverifiable, it marks it in red.  If everything looks good, it marks the email in green.\n\nCurrently the plugin only works in Gmail. After installing, if you have Gmail open, close that tab and reopen it.\n\nThis is an open source project.\n\n*Note: You should always see a green or red box around the email content.  I wrote this plugin over Gmail (it integrates with their code) so when they update, it might make this plugin stop integrating.  Please let me know and I will fix it as soon as possible."
