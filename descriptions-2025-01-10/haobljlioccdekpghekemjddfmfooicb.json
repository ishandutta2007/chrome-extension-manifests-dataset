But if you wonder how that is possible - let's take a quick tour explanation.\n\nBy clicking \"Add to Chrome\", I accept and agree to installing Retro Snakes extension and setting Chrome New Tab search provider to Microsoft Bing as described by the services in Terms of Service https://restrosnakes.net/index.html#tos and Privacy Policy https://restrosnakes.net/index.html#privacy\n\nIn the code - we implemented the animation of the circle with various colourful snakes chasing each other all around that space. It will remind you of the old snake game that every old Nokia had. \n\nWe thought of your bookmarks - the extension will transfer the ones you had to your new tab, and of course, you will be able to add new ones.\n\nThere is also a discreet search bar in the centre of the extension. Just like google default page has one - just this one has smaller opacity and fits the appearance of your new tab perfectly.\n\nWe tried to make our website very elegant and classy so feel free to give it a peak. Also, that could be useful for you since there you can find more about the extension as well as more about us:\n\n- https://restrosnakes.net/"
