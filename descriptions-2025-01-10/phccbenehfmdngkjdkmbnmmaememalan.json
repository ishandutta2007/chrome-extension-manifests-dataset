While dictionaries are used primarily to look up the meanings of words, Vocabulary Journal functions as a powerful tool for keeping track of and organizing your own collection of words, contexts, notes, etc. It also lets you know when and how to efficiently review those words and sentences by providing you with intelligent exercises. Additionally, Vocabulary Journal allows you to obtain the contextual meaning of any string. \n\n\n📖📖📖 Key Features 📖📖📖\n\nTo effectively master new words and phrases, it is crucial to recognize, analyze, and practice them. Vocabulary Journal provides three essential features that cater to these needs:\n\n1️⃣  Word and Phrase Highlighting:\nVocabulary Journal allows users to highlight specific words and phrases. By selecting a word or phrase on a web page, users can simply click the \"add\" button in the appeared bubble. This action will instantly highlight all lexical units with the same lemma across all tabs.\n\n2️⃣   Related Words and Phrases with Context:\nHovering over a highlighted word or phrase or selecting a string of text and clicking the \"more\" button in the bubble provides access to a context bubble. This bubble displays a comprehensive list of related words, phrases, and corresponding contexts. Users can scroll through this information to gain a better understanding of the vocabulary in question. To check the contextual meanings of the bolded words or phrases in the context, just click the note button under the context. And a click again toggles off the note box. \n\n3️⃣  Practice Exercises for Vocabulary Retention:\nVocabulary Journal offers practice exercises to help users retain the newly learned vocabulary. Clicking the \"more\" button, as described earlier, presents users with a multiple-choice question to test their knowledge of the lexical unit. Initially, the exercises are designed to be simpler. However, users have the option to generate a new test that offers slightly smarter questions by clicking the \"new test\" button.\n\nAdditionally, Vocabulary Journal allows users to search their journal. After clicking the Vocabulary Journal icon, a popup panel will appear, providing a search bar and listing the collected contexts below.\n\n\n📧📧📧 Contact us 📧📧📧\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or feature requests, feel free to send a message to lerner@vocabulary-journal.com anytime.
