When I visit a website with audio, I hear a loud pop as the sound turns on, followed by another pop several seconds after the audio stops.\n\nWith this extension running in the background, Wham! problem solved. Technically, the whisper is not completely endless, as it disables itself when the system is locked or idle for 10 minutes.\n\nEndless Whisper is Free Software (Apache 2.0 license)."
