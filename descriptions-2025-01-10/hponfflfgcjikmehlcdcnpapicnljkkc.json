You can set a hotkey in the Chrome Settings for Extensions. Next you can create your own format for the highlights, by going into the widget settings. Play around with the placeholders and use spaces to indent content.\n\nQUESTIONS / FEEDBACK:\nDo you have questions or feedback? The best approach is to write me directly on twitter.com/wirtzdan\n\nPERMISSIONS:\nRoam Highlighter needs to modify the websites you visit to display the widget. That's why it needs the requested permissions to function properly. However, the exact phrase (\"Read and change all your data on the website you visit\") make it sound more invasive than it actually is. Currently, the extension runs completely on your local machine and the only thing that is saved, are the settings you make."
