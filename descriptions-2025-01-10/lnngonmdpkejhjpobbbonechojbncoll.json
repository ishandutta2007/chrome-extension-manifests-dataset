It adds a \"Play all\" button that takes you to a playlist with all the channel's uploads.\n\nKnown limitations:\n1. Doesn't work well with the back and forward button. Currently it keeps adding the button if you keep going back and forth.\n2. The button row that I'm injecting this button to takes a bit time to finalize, so I've hardcoded the extension to add the button with a delay of 500ms - should work most of the time but if it doesn't show up a reload should do the trick.\n3. Not responsive. If you switch between breakpoints and cause YouTube to re-render (e.g. going from a big window to a small one) you'll need to reload to get it show again.\n\nAs of now this extension is pretty hardcoded and doesn't do anything fancy. If you need more complex features such as reverse the order of the playlist, I recommend checking out https://playlist.tools/.",

If you need more complex features such as reverse the order of the playlist, I recommend checking out https://playlist.tools/.\n\nWhat's new:\n\n1. Fixed an issue where using the browser's forward and back button will keep adding the play button to the button row.\n2. Fixed an issue where after a breakpoint change (i.e. a resize event that causes YouTube to re-render) the extension is not adding the play button again.\n3. Fixed an issue where the play button is not added if you deeplink (e.g. pasting the url into the address bar) into a channel page.\n4. Added localization for the follow locales: ar, ch, de, en, es, fr, hi, it, ja, kr, pt-br, ru, sw. There are no specific reasons for why I choose to add some languages than others, there are way too many languages I simply added the ones that I feel would cover more people first. Of course, if you want a locale/language to be supported, feel free to raise an issue/pull request in my github repository: https://github.com/i54cxy/youtube-play-all. Note: this localization only respond to the browser's locale, so if your browser is in for example Italian but your YouTube account is in Korean, the extension will still be in Italian.\n\nKnown limitation:\n\nDoesn't work with channels that doesn't have a handle (i.e. doesn't have the \"@\" in the url)."
