This happens because there is a lot of unnecessary text on the return label, such as the instructions and the \"Must be returned by ...\". If you remove those, then the label will usually fit on one page. This extension automatically hides the unnecessary pieces from getting printed so that you can save time and paper.\n\nObviously this will not *always* work, because some shipping methods require multiple labels and will never be able to fit on one page, but it seems to work on the majority of return labels I tried. \n\nCountries supported: amazon.com, amazon.ca, amazon.de -- contact me if you want to add support to your country.\n\n## Settings\n\nClicking on the extension's icon in the toolbar will show the settings page. After changing any setting, the page must be refreshed to take effect. There are currently three settings:\n\n- **Remove unnecessary content when printing**: This is the main feature of the extension. When this is turned on, unnecessary content from the label will be removed when printing.\n- **Remove unnecessary content when viewing web page**: When this is turned on, unnecessary content will be hidden when viewing the page.\n- **Remove \"Item Descriptions\" list**: The Item Descriptions table that appears below the return label can be useful for you, but it's not required for shipping. If you want to minimize printing, then turn this off. I personally like to know what item the label is for, so I keep this on."
