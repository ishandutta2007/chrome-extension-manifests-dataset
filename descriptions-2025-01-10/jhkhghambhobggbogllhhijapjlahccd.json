This is the only content that we access while you are browsing the web. We use header and title information to guide you through the caches once you reach a page with errors. The sites you visit and their content are not recorded by this addon. \nAdditionally, if you're visiting a secure (https) website, we won't be interrupting your web requests, error or not."
