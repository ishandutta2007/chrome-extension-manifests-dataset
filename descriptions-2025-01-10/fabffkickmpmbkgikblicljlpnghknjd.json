Have no fear!\n\nLinkBreaker takes the first 50 items with links on your current page and turns them into colourful bricks for your breaking pleasure. It leaves the contents of these links within the blocks so you can have the enjoyment of breaking the content of the page you're currently on. Simply start the game by clicking on the icon, and end it by pressing the `esc` key. \n\n\nLinkBreaker was a project made at YHack 2015, for a challenge of creating something under 4k. We used minified code and other methods of space saving for the submission, but the published version is a bit larger for numerous reasons.
