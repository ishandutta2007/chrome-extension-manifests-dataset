Do you want to see the real value of these posts without actually reading them? Do you want to save your time and focus on more important things?\n\nWell look no more! TLDR can summarize any post based on your preferences with the help of AI. You can setup summary type and summary length. The result will appear right above the original post (and in the original language) so you don’t even have to click on “Show More”. You will also see how long is the original post and how much time you can save.\n\nWe have 6 persona types who can do the summary for you:\n1. Helpful Assistant\n2. Standup Comedian\n3. Bored Teenager\n4. Mean Girl\n5. First-grader\n6. Grumpy Old Man\n\nYou can switch between them anytime in extension settings.\n\nLinkedIn is a trademark of LinkedIn Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries. This is an independent project and has no relationship to LinkedIn or LinkedIn Inc."
