Any appearance of the term \"President Trump\" triggers the 1994 SOUNDGARDEN hit song \"Black Hole Sun\" to play in its entirety*. All 5 minutes and 19 seconds will remind you that, over the next four years, an implosion is going to play out in our government that is just so huge. It’ll really knock your socks off, folks. Tremendous things. Big league.\n\nBut, where hides the face and lies the snake, there is sun in our disgrace; we’ve included a link to donate to the ACLU**, and plan to add other resources in the near future. Help wash away the reign (of Trump)!\n\n* We don’t claim copyright to \"Black Hole Sun\" and are in no way affiliated with SOUNDGARDEN (please don’t be mad at us).\n\n** We are also in no way affiliated with the ACLU, but we like them.
