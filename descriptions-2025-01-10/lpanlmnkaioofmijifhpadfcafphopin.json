From there, the extension will highlight the VIN, and create a green button for you to pull a vehicle sticker from. Simply, click this button to pull/download the sticker!\n\nIf the VIN does not highlight: \n- You are not logged into the iPacket Dealer Portal system, in which case, you can select the extension and login. You MUST login via the extension, logging into the web or mobile version of iPacket Dealer Portal WILL NOT carry over to the extension. \n- There was a problem on our end scanning the webpage you are on, however, we WILL still work if you highlight the VIN text, right-click, and select the iPacket® Sticker Puller context menu option.\n\nWe also provide a full coverage list, if you are curious what vehicles we support. This is located in the extension modal, after you login.\n\nTo use the iPacket® Sticker Puller extension you MUST have a valid iPacket Dealer Portal account under a dealership that has activated sticker pulling. If you do not, this extension WILL NOT work. To request an iPacket Dealer Portal account please visit: https://www.ipacket.us/dealer-center/request-account. To request that your store activate sticker pulling through iPacket, please talk with your iPacket representative to turn this feature on. Thank you.\n\nExample website that includes a working VIN:\n- https://www.ipacket.us/vehicle/55SWF4KB4JU277668\n\nExample videos:\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oo9KjDdxxE\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxq4xixVqNg\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbI1DfA0e4\n\n---\niPacket was born in a car dealership. We saw the angst every car buyer experienced. And we felt the burden every car dealer carried in trying to provide accurate information and backup. And we knew there was a better way. Today car buyers and dealers can simply turn to iPacket and find comprehensive detail, thorough documentation, and everything they need to know about their cars right at their fingertips.\n\nThere is more to a vehicle than a history report and price, let us show you!\n\nPrice is only an issue in the absence of value.™\n\nFor more information visit: https://www.ipacket.us/dealer-center"
