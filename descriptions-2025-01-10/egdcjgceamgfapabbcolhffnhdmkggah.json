The Warpdrive extension connects your Chrome browser to the Warpdrive Desktop Application. \n\nStart a new recording by specifying a starting URL, and optional inputs. Click record, and let Warpdrive observe as you do the task, which it will then immediately converts it into an intelligent automation. You can open websites, native applications, and do whatever you would normally do on those inputs for your task. Warpdrive is intelligent enough to generalize your task so it saves you repeated work on your desktop, or you can share with your colleagues and they can run on their machines.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Record a workflow\nWarpdrive learns from your clicks and actions. Just perform a task normally to teach Warpdrive how a workflow is done. When you want to use the input data, click \"Use\" on the panel and Ctrl+V paste it as part of your task.\n\n2. Work at warp-speed\nWhen you need to complete a task, just select a workflow. Warpdrive runs on auto-pilot reusing data as needed.\n\n3. Share with your team\nInvite everyone to share and collaborate. Shared workflows can run on your team member's machines.\n\nYou need the Warpdrive desktop application installed. Contact us at contact@warpdrive.co for more info."
