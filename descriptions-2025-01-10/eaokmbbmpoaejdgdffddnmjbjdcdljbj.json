Social Relief adds a button to your browser that's out of the way and won't interfere when you aren't using it.  Click the button and choose how long you want relief from Facebook:  1 day, 1 week or 1 month.\n\nOnce you have it set Social Relief will catch you when you try to visit Facebook and take you to someplace more pleasant.\n\nI made Social Relief for myself, and have found it's incredibly effective at keeping me away from Facebook.\n\nSocial Relief won't get in your way if you absolutely need to go to Facebook.  Just click the Social Relief button and turn it off in 1 click.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nLarge owl icon designed by mcarranza - https://thenounproject.com/carranzamaria/\nSmall owl icon designed by Julien Meysmans - https://thenounproject.com/M_Julz/"
