LiTags gives you the possibility to assign icons to your opponents which show up when you face them. Just click the plus icon next to your opponents username to bring up a popup where you can choose / search for a fitting tag. By clicking and dragging you can change the order of tags in a users tag list as well as remove tags.\n\nThis extension comes with extensive customization support in its options:\n- add, edit, delete tags and sets\n- view all users you have assigned tags to and edit tags you assigned them\n- import, backup all extension data\n- export tag sets and share them with others\n- general settings\n\nYou want to contribute to LiTags?
