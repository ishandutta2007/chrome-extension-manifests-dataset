Just open up your browser and you can easily see if you have anything to do right away (airdrops, claims, mints, events). \n\nTokencall also helps you know that you are receiving action events from the verified smart contract itself, not a hacked Discord or Twitter message that could scam you. \n\nConnect your wallet to https://tokencall.xyz and then sign in to the extension where you can follow your tokens for actionable events and have them waiting for you when you open your browser. \n\nTokencall currently works with Ethereum and Solana."
