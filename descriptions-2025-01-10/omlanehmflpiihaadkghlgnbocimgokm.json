Just set up a sequence of emails to send to your recipients over time from your Gmail™. \n\nLet’s say you meet a lot of people at a networking event. You want to email all of them to explore opportunities, but it’s hard to follow up with so many people. Auto Follow Up for Gmail™ makes it easy to reach your clients. It automates the process for you with personalized emails to multiple contacts with just a few clicks. \n\nAuto Follow Up for Gmail™ has two methods to create auto follow-ups:\n\n***Auto Follow Up on Your Emails***\nSend an email as usual, then activate follow-up either during the sending (click on Gmail Auto Follow-Up under the send button) or after it’s sent by selecting the email in your Sent label and activating a follow-up template for this email. Follow-up templates specify intervals, email content, and whether to track clicks and opens. In other words, Follow-up templates define criteria and conditions under which additional emails will be sent and emails which will be sent.\n\nExample: You email an employee about a deal status. To ensure the email isn’t overlooked, activate a follow-up so if there’s no reply in two days, a follow-up email is automatically sent.\n\nThis feature is great for managers, sales call follow-up, effective client communication, and more.\n✅ Managers: Ensures timely communication by sending automatic reminders, like if there's no reply on a project status within a set timeframe.\n✅ Sales Call Follow-Up: Increases conversion rates by maintaining persistent contact, such as resending proposal details to a client who hasn't responded after the initial sales call.\n✅ Client Communication: ensure that important information requests are addressed promptly and not forgotten (e.g., reminding a client to send required documents).\n\n***Auto Follow Up Campaigns***\nStart the cloudHQ wizard, upload your recipient list, and set your follow-up rules and sequences. Follow-up rules determine the criteria and conditions under which additional emails will be sent. These rules can be based on various triggers, such as a recipient opening the initial email, clicking a link within the email, or not responding within a specified time frame. In addition, you need to establish your follow-up sequences, which are the series of messages that will be sent to recipients over a period of time.\n\nExample: You send an email campaign to 100 warm leads from a trade show offering to set up a demo of your product. When you send that campaign, you set it so that two days later, a follow-up email (a reminder) is sent to anyone who hasn’t replied. Three days after that, another reminder is sent, and a few days after that, a final email is sent asking for a reply.\n\nThis approach is perfect for sales outreach for large number of recipient:\n✅ Take advantage of all your opportunities and close more business. \n✅ Save time and get more done with automated outreach emails to prospects. \n✅ Always be visible to your clients in their inbox. \n\n***Features include***\n\n👉 Mail merge so that you can send out bulk email messages that look personalized. You can import recipient list and merge tags from Google Sheets, CSV or Google Contacts.\n👉 Simple-to-set-up, automated email responses.\n👉 Email tracking so that you know who read your emails, and when. \n👉 Gmail email templates so that your emails can either be beautiful html-based templates, or just simple text-based templates. The choice is yours!\n👉 Video email so that you can record yourself in an email via video so that you can \"speak\" to your audience.\n👉 Screencasting so that you can demonstrate something on your screen. \n👉 The ability to link back to your CRM, like Salesforce.\n\nAll this, right from your Gmail™ account! There's no 3rd party website you'll need to learn or visit.\n\nWhether you're a:\n👨🏾‍💼A busy professional, and you want to follow up with 40 new potential clients whose cards you just picked up at a convention last week.\n👩‍🏫An overworked teacher that needs to schedule 75 parent/teacher conferences.\n👨🏿‍⚖️A lawyer who needs to constantly remind his clients that they need to send their emails for discovery.\n👩🏽‍💼A realtor who wants to send out her latest listing to your clients.\n👨🏼‍🎓A job seeker who wants to make sure that they're automatically following up with recruiters.\n👰🏻🤵🏽Or maybe you’re getting married and you need to remind 150 of your friends to RSVP.\n\nGet started today! \n\ncloudHQ.
