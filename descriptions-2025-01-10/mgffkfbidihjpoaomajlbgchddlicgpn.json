Your keys are kept secure in the extension's storage area and are encrypted with a password.\n\nLeverage smart cold wallets via Trezor‚Ñ¢ hardware wallet compatibility or via a secret 12-word recovery phrase, which makes it easy for you to restore your wallet. Remember, don't forget your phrase, and keep it safe and secret!\n\nFor dApp developers, we offer a simple API that facilitates integrating solutions with the Syscoin blockchain and other EVM-based blockchains through the extension. The API guide is available here: https://docs.paliwallet.com/guide/ \nPlease, note that the docs are currently outdated and will be updated soon to properly explain how to integrate with Pali through the API guide.\n\nBy complying with the EIP-1193: Ethereum Provider JavaScript API standard, developers can seamlessly integrate via the window.ethereum object. For Syscoin Core, Pali leverages the open-source library sysweb3 (https://github.com/pollum-io/sysweb3), alongside a fully custom, optimized implementation of a UTXO interface for content script (window.pali).\n\nPali is fully open-source and audited, which means you can check everything for yourself. We're maintained by talented developers who work closely with our community, so users are able to build future versions alongside our team.\n\nYou will soon be able to seamlessly use your Pali Wallet across Web and Mobile devices.
