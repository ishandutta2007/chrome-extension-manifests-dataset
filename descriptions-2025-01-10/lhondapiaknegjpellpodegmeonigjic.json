Trump? Minted by shady back room real estate, distributed by reality television and crowned by incessant polling of ultra-early primary voters, Trump is the latest, hilarious permutation of American leadership. He is not the candidate we need, but surely the one we deserve.\n\nIn a political atmosphere where ascendance can be manufactured through attention, the only way to deflate Trump's political star is through suffocation. Trump can only lose if we turn off the TV.\n\nThus, the Trump Filter is presented as part of the antidote for this toxic candidacy. This Chrome extension will identify parts of a web page likely to contain Donald Trump and erase them from the Internet.\n\nShare with your friends and eliminate the only currency Trump can spend to win: brand recognition.\n\nRELEASE LOG:\n\n1.0.1 - Changed default filter setting to \"Mild.\"\n1.1 - Fixed some bugs on news sites.\n1.1.1 - jQuery version bump."
