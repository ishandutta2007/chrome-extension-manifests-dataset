If you are like me who usually have plenty of tabs open spread over several windows, it can be difficult to find which tab is playing sounds. You can now quickly jump to tabs that are making sounds with this extension!\n\nIf two or more tabs are playing sounds, the extension will cycle through all of those tabs with each press, so that you can filter out the sounds you don't need and keep on listening to the tabs you want to play!\n\nThe default shortcut is Alt+Shift+S. Keybindings can be edited through the \"Keyboard Shortcut\" menu at chrome://extensions/shortcuts\n\n\nIcon created by Hamish from Noun Project"
