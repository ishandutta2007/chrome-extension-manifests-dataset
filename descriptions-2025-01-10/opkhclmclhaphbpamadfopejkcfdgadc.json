In order to process an order, Verse needs some user information as well as the products being ordered. Previously users of our software could enter this information on our web portal, but we are offering an additional way to submit orders using this extension. Users often already have the relevant information in some internal software. Instead of manually transferring this information from their software to our portal, they can capture screenshots of this information and submit them to our team for processing. The extension will first prompt the user to sign in on versemedical.com, then it will allow the user to capture a screenshot of the usersâ€™s information from any webpage they wish. Next they will be able to take a screenshot of the products they are ordering. After these steps they can click submit and the screenshots will be submitted to versemedical.com for processing."
