This tries to simply remove the ads and leave the site fully usable. Let me know if it misses any ads for you. Quora™ makes changes to their site from time to time that breaks something, all easily fixed.\n\nAnd note that if you make the extension's icon visible in the browser toolbar, it'll keep a running tally of how many ads it removes."
