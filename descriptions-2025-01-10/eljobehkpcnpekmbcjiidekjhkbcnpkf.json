The extension injects the Ethereum web3 API (as defined in EIP-1193), which dapps can connect to to read/write data to the blockchain.\n\nethui is focused on providing developer-oriented features such as tighter integration with Foundry & Anvil, the popular toolking for Ethereum development.\nWith ethui, you get access to faster feedback loops and automatic data resyncs when testing contracts locally. You can also enjoy features previously available only on live nets, such as the ability to impersonate addresses directly from your provider.\n\nethui also allows you to manage multiple identities (Wallets) and conenct different dapps to different wallets according to your preferences."
