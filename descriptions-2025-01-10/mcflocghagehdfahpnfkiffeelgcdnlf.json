In this game, players control a fiery orb encircled by flames, tasked with navigating through a series of obstacles within a circular arena.\n\nThe objective of Fire Circle is to survive for as long as possible while avoiding collision with the incoming obstacles, which include spinning blades, moving barriers, and other hazards. Players must maneuver their fiery orb skillfully by tapping or swiping on the screen, timing their movements precisely to slip through narrow gaps and avoid getting burned.\n\nAs players progress through the game, the intensity increases, with obstacles appearing more frequently and moving at faster speeds. This escalation in difficulty challenges players to stay focused and react quickly to survive the increasingly frantic pace of the game."
