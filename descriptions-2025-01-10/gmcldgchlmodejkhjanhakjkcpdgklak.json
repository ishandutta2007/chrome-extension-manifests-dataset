At the end of the month, this commission is added up and one lucky user who has purchased something from Amazon will get all of the commission.\n\nThe more people that use the extension, the higher the prize pool will be, it's that simple.\n\nNote: Please tweet @LotteryAmazon the time that you've completed your order and we'll give you one ticket in to the draw. Good luck!"
