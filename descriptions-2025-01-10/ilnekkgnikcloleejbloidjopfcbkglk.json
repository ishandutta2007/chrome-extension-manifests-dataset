It also helps them to open YouTube easy without and hesitation. \n********************\nTo do that we made YT-Focus(YouTube Focus) We make sure\n1) The first home page should be clean only the search bar to be present.\n(The rotating sphere around our logo is the symbol to represent the person should know why they visited this page and first complete that task).\n*******\n2) Make sure you pin the extension with the toolbar because it has an additional feature to be used as a notepad on any website and due to privacy reason all the data is locally stored to your system only.\n********\n3) While watching the video max. of the time people visit to read the comments and due to such activity their productivity rate reduces.\n\nIt is better to be focused when you are surrounded by so much data and unnecessary information.\n***************************\nDownload the extension and use it for 1week as a challenge and see the changes in your productivity rate.\n\nNOT WORKING?\nPlease use the feedback button to alert me if YouTube™ is not being displayed properly.\n\nREGARDING PRIVACY\nI do not read, examine or track your browser history or any other personal information.  The only permissions I ask for are \"tabs\" to insert the functionality and \"storage\" to store your settings.  \nThis chrome extension is the tool to remove the distraction components from the YouTube™."
