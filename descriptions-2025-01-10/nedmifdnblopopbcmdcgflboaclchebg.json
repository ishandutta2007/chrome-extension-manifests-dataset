It also shows how many positions the website lost or raised compared to search you performed the previous day.\n\nWhen you search Google, Yahoo! or Bing with SERPTrends turned on for the first time all positions are marked as new. The next day you will see dynamics for previously performed searches. This addon is useful for SEO & SEM specialists.\n\nHow to use:\nAfter installation SERPTrends SEO Extension for Google Chrome is enabled by default and you will see colorized icon (red and green triangles) in the addon bar of your browser. Perform Google search to see position numbers and dynamics icons near each result in the SERP. For the first time all the positions for certain query is marked as new but the next day dynamics appears. Though addon was created primarily for SEO specialists, any other user can find it useful, since it adds numbers search results and shows which site moved up and is considered more relevant by search engine."
