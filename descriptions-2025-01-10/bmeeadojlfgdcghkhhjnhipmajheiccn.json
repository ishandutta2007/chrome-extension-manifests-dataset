Impress your team and get your slides done faster with SlidesWhiz!\n\nSlidesWhiz actions and shortcuts include:\n- Object alignment\n- Font color\n- Fill color\n- Border color\n- Format options\n- Font size increase/decrease\n\nUnlike other Google Slides add-ons, SlidesWhiz works instantly and feels \"native\", allowing you to stay in the flow and build polished presentations, faster.\n\nPower users of PowerPoint that have made the switch to Google Slides are very familiar with the pain of losing the Quick Access Toolbar and keyboard shortcuts for commonly used features e.g. object alignment. Having felt this visceral pain ourselves, we set out to build a simple but powerful solution. The result was SlidesWhiz, and we hope it restores your productivity (and sanity) as much as it did ours!\n\nPlease reach out if you have any feedback or questions, we are always looking for ways to make SlidesWhiz even better!"
