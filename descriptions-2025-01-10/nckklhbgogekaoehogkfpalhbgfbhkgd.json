These summaries have the following properties:\n\n*    They reflect the true content because Infocodex with its comprehensive and universal linguistic knowledge repository understands the content without any training (unlike its competitors). They can immediately be applied in any topic.\n\n*    Documents are automatically divided into plausible subsections entitled by subheadings by means AI supported methods.\n\n*    The summaries reflect the structure of the original document as set by the author\n\n*    They are easy to read and they facilitate the communication withln workgroups.\n\n*    Significant time savings: 5-15 minutes per day for typical users / 30-60 for professional readers (estimates of 7 test readers).\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\nEfficiency - Time and cost saving; particularly for long documents\nOverview - Fast view on the whole; separate wheat from the chaff\nCommunication - Common basis of understanding within work groups\nInfoLinks - Direct links of the summary positions to the original document"
