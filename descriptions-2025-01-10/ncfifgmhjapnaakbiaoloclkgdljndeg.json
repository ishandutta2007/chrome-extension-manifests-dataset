Though security of the message is preserved until you read it, a camera, hidden or exposed, will always keep an eye on what you read. If you belong to such a category of professional / person, whose activities are worth tracking using Visual surveillance, this system is an alternative. At its very infancy, this expects the users to put their headphones , wired or wireless, on before you hit the decrypt button. Our next version will come with many other feature including the precondition that it's connected to an earphone.
