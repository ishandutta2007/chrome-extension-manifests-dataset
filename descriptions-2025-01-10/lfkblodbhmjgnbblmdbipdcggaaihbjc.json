At user set intervals, the portlets will refresh across all Chrome tabs that contain an open NetSuite Center.\n\nI am a NetSuite user myself and I know how frustrating it can be to refresh important KPI's and actionable charts one by one. This tool allows you to set the refresh interval once and have confidence that your data is always up to date.\n\nUnlike similar extensions, this targets ALL open NetSuite Centers that have active portlets running. This includes custom search portlets and custom KPI charts within both native and custom centers.\n\nRelease Notes:\n**2023.01 to 2023.03 - failed \"beta\" versions, womp.\n**2023.04 - Initial \"successful\" launch. 9/5/2023\n**2023.05 - Added URL support for all NetSuite account types (Production, Sandbox, Release Preview, etc...), and added a custom interval selector. 9/8/2023"
