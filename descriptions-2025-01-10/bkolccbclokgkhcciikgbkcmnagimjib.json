If you want to save a new bookmark into one of your bookmark folders or into a new bookmark folder it takes a few clicks to choose the folder. For people who save a lot of bookmarks and want to keep them organized in folders this can be quite tedious.\n\nFast Bookmark provides an autocomplete input field to easily choose the right folder for the new bookmark. Just open Fast Bookmark (best is to set a shortcut to open the extension, e.g. CTRL+Shift+S), start typing the name of the folder and hit enter. Finished.\n\nCreating a new folder is super easy as well: Just type \"> my-new-folder\" and Fast Bookmark will create a new folder with the name \"my-new-folder\" and save the bookmark into it.\n\nCreating subfolders is possible as well: For example type \"Technology > my-new-subfolder\" and Fast Bookmark will create a new subfolder with the name \"my-new-folder\" within the folder with the name \"Techology\" and save the bookmark into it.\n\nThe code of this extension is available at: https://github.com/wasserth/fast-bookmark"
