We are still working on improving our support of the last changes of the RTM itself.\n---\nWhat's new in 0.4:  The app uses last size and position of \"Add Task\" pop-up to open the pop-up next time.\n----\n\nMore info about the extension:\n\nYou may know the \"Quick Add\"-bookmarklet [ https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/?ctx=quickadd.whatis ], that allows quickly add tasks to RTM. Unfortunately it doesn't include URL of based webpage.\n\nThis extension solves this problem. It based on simple bookmarklet described in the tip: [ http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/3133/ ]. Extension works similarly to that bookmarklet, but it doesn't need additional bookmark panel or over clicks for using. It's displayed near the address bar that's why it's much more convenient.\n\nThis product uses the Remember The Milk page but is not endorsed or certified by Remember The Milk. It doesn't use Remember The Milk API."
