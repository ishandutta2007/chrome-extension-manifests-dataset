This extension enables you to take a closer look on the video content before actually clicking on it, by peeking the:\n\n- Video content\n- Audio transcription or subtitles\n- Description\n- Comments\n- Channel\n\nYou can also view the:\n\n- Thumbnail in the highest resolution available\n- Full titles\n\nTo do that, you just need to click on the recommended video's menu (the three dots button) and choose the option you want. It works on pretty much all pages, and is compatible with both YouTube's desktop and mobile layouts, and dark theme.\n\nPeek video content\n----------------\n\nWhen you peek the video content, it's shown to you the video's storyboard, which is a series of snapshots from the video in different moments from the beginning to the end. You can click the timestamps to open the video directly in the part you are interested in.\n\nPeek audio transcription\n----------------\n\nWhile the \"Peek video content\" feature enables you to check the *visual* content of the video, the \"Peek audio transcription\" feature enables you to check the *verbal* content. This is most useful for videos that are just someone talking about something, or videos that you don't know exactly what it is about and you just need to peek the first few spoken sentences where the presenter explains it. \n\nYou can click the timestamps to open the video directly in the part you are interested in. You also have the option of choosing a language to which the transcript should be translated, and in the extension's settings you can set a preferred language which the transcript should always be in.\n\nPeek description\n----------------\n\nSome videos add a summary of the video content in the description, and others elaborate a little more on what the video is about, which is an alternative for confirming the video's subject.\n\nPeek comments\n----------------\n\nThe \"Peek comments\" feature makes you able to check what the viewers think of the video in a minimalist interface. \n\nPeeking the comments is useful for cases when there's something clearly incorrect in the video and at least someone in the comments points that out, or when you're not really interested in the video, but only in what people say about the subject. This can also be used as an alternative method for confirming what the video is about or its content.\n\nPeek channel\n----------------\n\nWhen you peek a channel a small viewport is opened so you can take a look on the video's channel content and even watch videos without leaving the page. \n\nThis is useful to make sure whether you can hide the whole channel from your recommendations, or just to take a look on the channel's other videos.\n\nView high-res thumbnail\n----------------\n\nYou can also view the video cover (thumbnail) in the highest resolution available.\n\nFull titles\n----------------\n\nAdditionally, the extension also makes all titles be displayed in full, without any trimming or ellipsis."
