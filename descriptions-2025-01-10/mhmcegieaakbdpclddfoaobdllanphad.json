For example I use this to connect my local PBX server to my computer. When I want to call a user or a company I just click their phone number and it links to my desk phone. \n\nIf you have a FreePBX server and want to add a way to click to make calls this is the plugin for you. I am sure it will work with other providers as well, I am just not familiar with them. \n\nThis project is open source so please feel free to checkout the github page."
