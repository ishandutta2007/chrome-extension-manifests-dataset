This extension accomplishes this with a great degree of accuracy and average speeds of ~5 seconds or less.\n\nNow, you don't have to switch between multiple tools just for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). With this extension, you can easily upload an image file or drag and drop it for conversion into text, which will automatically populate your ChatGPT textbox.\n\nAdditionally, if you have a screenshot in your clipboard, you can directly paste (Ctrl+V) it into the textbox. Quick, hassle-free, and highly efficient - this extension is built with a focus on speed, user-friendliness, and most importantly, privacy.\n\nFor the Tech Savvy: Powered by Tesseract.js, this extension runs OCR directly in your browser, keeping your data secure as none of your information leaves your device. All the OCR work is performed locally, ensuring maximum privacy.\n\nBut we understand that sometimes, you may need an extra level of precision or need to retain the original format of the image, especially when dealing with content like Python code. For such instances, we provide an option to enable an embedded third-party solution created by Pieces.app. Check out their service at: https://www.codefromscreenshot.com/\n\nAll source code for complete transparency can be found on GitHub at: https://github.com/Tshetrim/Image-To-Text-OCR-extension-for-ChatGPT\n\nJoin the Discord to share feedback, errors, or just chat: https://discord.gg/8hnkBhwTJ5\n\nDisclaimer: Please note, if you opt to use the third-party embedded option, your privacy and data handling will be subject to their policy as this extension is not affiliated with them.\n\nInvest in your productivity today with our Chrome GPT extension, and experience the future of text transcription!"
