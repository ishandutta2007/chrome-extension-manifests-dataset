Using this tool, users can quickly search for relevant line items in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and see their corresponding price limits.\n\nThe extension simplifies NDIS pricing for Participants, Support Coordinators, and other professionals in the disability sector, enabling them to find pricing information for NDIS supports directly from their browser.\n\nThe pricing information is updated whenever a new Pricing Arrangements is released and will reflect the current limits. However, users can also switch through some of the previous Pricing Arrangements to help keep track of any variations throughout a plan period."
