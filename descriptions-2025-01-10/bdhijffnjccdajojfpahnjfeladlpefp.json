And the worst part of such an encounter? They keep playing in a loop. If you don't want this to happen again, install GIF Blocker and experience GIF Free Internet. \n\nWe may often need to block GIFs on a particular page only, not the whole internet. For such cases, you can turn off the extension and click 'Block GIFs on the current tab' whenever you may need to.\nIn case you need to see some GIFs, turn off the extension by clicking the extension button. You can turn it on similarly.\n\nDisclaimer: It doesn't block all types of animated content, but GIFs only.\n\nBonus Point: This extension will save a lot of data consumed by loading GIF."
