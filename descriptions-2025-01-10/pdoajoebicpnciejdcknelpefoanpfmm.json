You tell yourself you’ll remember without taking a note, but we all know how that goes. Or maybe you keep rewinding to catch each word, or try to jot down notes from memory — it all just breaks the flow…\n\nSo, you click on the extension, and a simple panel appears beside the video, synced perfectly with what’s being said. Like subtitles, but designed for note-takers.\n\nYou hover over the words you want to save, the video pauses. Highlight to save. Move your mouse away, and the video continues. You didn’t have to rewind or replay once. The extension just hands you the words to keep.\n\nBy the end of the video, you’re not left wishing you could remember – you’ve got those epic lines and mind-blowing insights saved exactly as they were spoken. You can review them all or hit the “Copy All” and paste them wherever you like.\n\nSure, YouTube has a transcript, but it’s clunky and full of timestamps that get in the way. And yes, AI summaries exist, but they often rewrite things in their own words, losing the exact phrasing that made you stop and listen in the first place. This keeps the full impact intact.\n\nTaking notes doesn’t have to feel like work. Just hover, highlight, and keep going. It’s free, easy, and 100% private. Built for people who want to keep what they find, not just watch and forget.\n\nInstall it now, and make every video count.\n\nPlease read this also: If you run into any issues or feel like leaving less than 5 stars because of a bug, please reach out to me first at hrytsak.dev@gmail.com  – I’m here to help and ready to make it right!"
