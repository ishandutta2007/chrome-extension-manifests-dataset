These messages are sent as special links in your favorite chat and email environments.  As soon as the message is read a Certified Message destroys the message and becomes a tripwire link reporting on any unauthorized viewers.  \n\nUse Certified Messages to improve the privacy and security of many of your favorite web-based chat and email environments such as Google Plus, Facebook, Twitter, GMail (G-Mail), Hotmail, Snapchat, Yahoo Mail and more.  You can see if anyone has been spying on you by going back and looking at the Certified Message links to see the IP address attempting to access your links."
