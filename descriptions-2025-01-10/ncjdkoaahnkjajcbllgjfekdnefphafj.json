Weather for your location, Bookmarks, and Recent visits, all are displayed in Material Design cards and ready when you open any new tabs. You don't have to go through many menu items to find a bookmark, or press key combination to open your history page. They are right there when Chrome launches or a new tab is created.\n\nWant more control? Visit Settings to change temperature unit to Farenheit or use a random background from Unsplash.\n\nNOTES: \n1. The extension needs your location and uses cookies to request and save weather info. That's all. It does not collect any personal data of yours.\n2. Dark mode is only supported in Chrome 75 and later on Windows 10 May 2019 and macOS Mojave onwards."
