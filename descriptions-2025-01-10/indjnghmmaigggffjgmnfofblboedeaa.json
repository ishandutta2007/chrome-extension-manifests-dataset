This will help students make better and faster decisions regarding to which dining hall to go. It can also motive dining halls to improve the quality of dishes that are downvoted and provide more often the dishes that are upvoted.\n\nWe added two buttons after each dish in the menu: one upvote and one downvote, and appended the number of upvotes and downvotes by former students. You can only upvote or downvote a dish once, and we will store the vote into the database server and update the vote counts immediately."
