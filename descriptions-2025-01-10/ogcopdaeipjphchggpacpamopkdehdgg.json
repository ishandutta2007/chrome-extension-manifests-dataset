Look for the “E” icon, in-context on the page, or on the right-hand side to indicate access is available through your institution or freely available as Open Access.  We do the work of checking your access to articles (by DOI), with no setup needed by your institution.  You may be prompted to login to your institution upon clicking a link. \n\nEBSCOhost Passport requires Read and Change Permissions. The Read permissions are in order to scan the page for DOI's. The Change permissions are to add icons and links to the page in order to make it easier to find the content on available sources. EBSCOhost Passport does not add any additional trackers or modify the page in any way other than to add these icons and links. No personal user information or user-specific browsing history is collected or transmitted and EBSCO does not share data with 3rd parties."
