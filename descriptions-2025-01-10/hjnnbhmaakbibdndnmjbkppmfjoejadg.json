Supports excluding arbitrary URLs and fragments, and generating mobile-like UAs.\n\nA User-Agent string is a piece of information that your computer sends to every website you go to. It tells them what software you use to access the Internet, what kind of computer you’re using, and what kind of operating system you use. Some of this is really important to those websites, but most of it isn’t, and it can be used to help track you without your consent.\n\nMany browser fingerprinting solutions use the User-Agent as a relatively constant string, because most users UAs only change when their browser updates. Therefore, having a different UA on each request make it a lot easier to evade these tracking schemes.\n\nRandomUA requires access to all URLs and web request data for its core function: it has to be able to change your user agent string!"
