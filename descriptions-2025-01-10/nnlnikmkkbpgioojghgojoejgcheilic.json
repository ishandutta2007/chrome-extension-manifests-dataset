Sometimes, however, it can be onerous.  \n\nIf you want to ensure that a user can access Salesforce without requiring a verification code or security token, you need to \"whitelist\" their IP on Setup => Security Controls => Network Access.\n\nIf you have a lot of IPs to whitelist, or you want to whitelist dynamic IPs, or you simply want to disregard this requirement altogether, enter this extension: Whitelist All IPs for Salesforce!\n\nSimply:\n1) Enable this plugin\n2) Navigate to Setup => Security Controls => Network Access in your Salesforce org (must be an Admin)\n3) Click the Whitelist All IPs button\n4) Wait!  There is a progress indicator, it can take 30 seconds to 3 minutes depending on your connection.\n\nHuge credit to Moti Korets for his SFDC Debug Logs extension, which had this \"hidden feature\"(https://github.com/motiko/sfdc-debug-logs).  \n\nBy the way!  This started as a homepage component, but the ability to run javascript in homepage components went away around Summer, 2015 -- hence the need for this extension."
