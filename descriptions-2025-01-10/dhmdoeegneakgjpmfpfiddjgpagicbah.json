The results can be used for a variety of purposes, including answering questions, providing information, generating creative content, and more.\n\nHere's how to use the extension:\n\n1. Install the extension in Google Chrome\n2. Open a new tab in Google Chrome\n3. Enter a query into the search bar\n4. The results will be displayed below the search bar\n\nSome possible uses for the extension include:\n- Answering questions and providing information on a wide range of topics\n- Generating creative content, such as writing prompts or story ideas\n- Providing suggestions and recommendations based on the user's query\n- Automating tasks or generating reports based on user inputs\n\nOverall, the possibilities for this extension are limited only by the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT API and the user's imagination."
