In the future I'll post an alternative version without that feature.\n\nThe source is on GitHub.\nhttps://github.com/niieani/Asana-Research-Chrome-Extension/\nIf you have an improvement, file a pull request.\n\nIf you have suggestions or comments, leave a review or email me at:\nbazyli.brzoska (at) gmail.com"
