When you click it, the current tab URL and (optionally the title) get saved to your Dokuwiki (https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) installation via an RPC call.\n\n** Configuration: **\n\nOnce you have the extension installed, go ahead and enable the XML-RPC setting on your wiki. You can find this setting under `Configuration Settings` --> `Authentication` --> `remote` and `remoteuser`. You need to enable the remote API system, and optionally whitelist the user credentials you plan to provide to this extension. You can create a dedicated user and only allow access to a specific page, or use your primary account. All calls are sent via HTTPS, so this extension should not induce any significant security vulnerabilities not present in dokuwiki itself.\n\n** Usage: **\n\n- Open the Options page (right click on icon and choose \"Options\") and enter your wiki domain, username, and password. Note that these credentials are stored using the chrome sync (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage) api, and are not transmitted anywhere outside of chrome.\n- The key combo \"Ctrl+Shift+S\" will open a session browser, where you can copy all open tabs from another device in a nice list.\n\n\n** Why do you need X permission? **\n\n- `Read and change all your data on websites you visit` - without this permission the extension cannot send data to your wiki. Since it's impossible for this extension to limit itself to only your wiki domain, it has to ask for access to all pages. Feel free to audit the code to confirm that this is the case.\n- we need `active tab` to get the current URL and title of the page you are on.\n- 'sessions' is required to list all open tabs on other devices."
