This extension will improve your efficiency and help you go through the content of a website much quicker.\n\nIt is perfect for news sites, forums, shopping sites, corporate web pages and many more.\n\nPlease note that the extension blocks cross-domain pages to protect your security. In other words, only pages from the same website/domain will be shown.\n\nBe ready to experience a new way of using your browser!\n\nPlease let me know if you need additional features. I am fully committed to maintain and improve the extension.\n\nIMPORTANT: \n- The extension will be ready once the website is fully loaded. You can check the status of the extension from its icon as it will turn to green once ready. \n- To activate the extension press Ctrl and move your mouse over a link.\n- You can change your settings by clicking on the extension icon. For ex, if you do not want to keep pressing Ctrl, you can update the behavior at the settings section.\n\nENJOY! \n\nPlease send us an email if you want new features and we'd be more than happy to implement :)",
