With just a few clicks in our proprietary Telegram DApp, you can buy and manage Nodes or Services with an extensive range of options/configurations. Moreover, we utilize a revenue sharing program in which all revenues generated by our platform are distributed to holders. With our offering, we play into the recent momentum of two key aspects in DeFi - Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks and Telegram-based tools, both of which will be touched upon in the next paragraphs."
