Right after you install, enable, disable, or uninstall, you may need to refresh currently open Trello pages.\n\nSome generic dark mode plugins work great, but add some delay to page loads, while this is very lightweight by comparison.  Also, the built in Trello dark mode has white card faces, which was a deal breaker.\n\nIf you want to customize further or see the CSS, you should be able to take my code via the developer console if you want to adapt it for another site or modify it somehow.\n\nPersonal Information Access: The code that injects the CSS background colors and text colors needs access to the loaded Trello page. That page will contain your Trello user content, and so there will be a permissions warning due to that.  You can use the developer console to examine the code before logging in to Trello if you have any concerns."
