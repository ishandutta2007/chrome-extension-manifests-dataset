The way we do this is by making every request to the internet come from a different IP address. By doing this it makes it impossible for anyone to determine the location or identity of who you are.\n\n<b>Hide your Identity</b>\nShadow Router hides your identity by changing your ip address for every request. Meaning when you visit a website every file from that website was requested by a different ip address.\n\n<b>Block Trackers</b>\nShadow Router blocks trackers by not even attempting too get information from tracker scripts. We have a list of over 30,000 trackers.\n\n<b>Stay Encrypted</b>\nShadow Router Encrypts your connection all the way to the site. Even if the site isn't \"https\". This encryption makes it so that not even we know who you are.\n\nThis extension allows you to access the Shadow Router Network with HTTP/HTTPS.\nTo learn more please go to: https://shadowrouter.org"
