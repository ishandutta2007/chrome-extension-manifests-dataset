If the website is also using Cloudflare to proxy its web traffic, Optics may also provide additional information about Cloudflare-specific capabilities being leveraged by the user. For more information, review the section \"Optics Behavior Outline\" below.\n\nBy using Optics, you agree to Cloudflare’s Website and Online Services Terms of Use (https://www.cloudflare.com/website-terms/) and acknowledge Cloudflare’s Privacy Policy (https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).\n\n=====================================================\nOptics Behavior Outline:\n\n1) The Optics browser extension locally inspects the incoming responses from websites visited in your browser and runs a small snippet of code in each webpage you visit solely to establish whether HTTP version 1, 1.1, 2, or 3 was used by the website.\n2) The extension determines whether the website is being proxied by Cloudflare by evaluating the website's IP address and \"server\" response header against known valid Cloudflare configurations.\n3a) If the website is not proxied by Cloudflare, the Optics extension will show you information about your connection to the website, such as the HTTP version, data compression format and Server IP that the website is using.\n3b) If the website is proxied by Cloudflare, the Optics extension will show you information about your connection to the website, described above, as well as place a background request to a Cloudflare endpoint to determine additional information about your connection. An example of this additional information would be whether you are leveraging Cloudflare’s WARP or Gateway solutions to protect your browsing activity."
