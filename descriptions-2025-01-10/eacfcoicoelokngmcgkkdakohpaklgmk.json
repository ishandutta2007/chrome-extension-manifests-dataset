They are usually double-sided cards with a question or content to remember on one side, and the corresponding answer or explanation on the back. Going through flashcards repeatedly helps the brain better encode and consolidate memories, allowing quick mastery of knowledge. Flashcards emphasize active recall rather than passive memorization, making them more effective for retention.\n\nQ2: What is an Article summary?\nA2: With official support from OpenAI, NoteGPT aims to help users automatically generate flashcards from any text on any webpage, such as videos, PDFs, articles, etc., enabling smarter learning.
