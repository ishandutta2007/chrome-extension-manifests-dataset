Click on the extension icon (or press Alt+Shift+M), then click the screenshot button (or press Alt+Shift+S) and watch your screen getting captured in multiple presets.\n\nNo bloat, no ads, no unnecessary permissions, just a simple way to automate taking screenshots for your responsive pages.\n\nIn order to screenshot the page, a new window opens for each device preset so please be patient as it works on generating the images.\n\nExport your result to PNG, JPEG, PDF (a4 format) or even upload them to the cloud and more, all from the options page (click on the cog icon or press Alt+Shift+O while the extension is open).\n\nThe extension is currently run by an independent developer. View the open source project and its code on github: https://github.com/HamzaEzzRa/Multishot\n\nIf you encounter an issue, or want to contribute to the project feel free to open an issue at the link above. You can also email me directly about your ideas. This project is open source and the extension will always remain completely free.\n\nChange Log:\n1.0 - 2021/07/02 - Added PDF and Cloud hosting options and several tweaks - Official release to Chrome Web Store\n0.4 - 2021/06/21 - Added zoom level controls for each preset and fixed bugs\n0.3 - 2021/06/18 - Added several new options and introduced hotkeys\n0.2 - 2021/06/15 - Added preset controls and an options page\n0.1 - 2021/06/13 - First release of Multishot"
