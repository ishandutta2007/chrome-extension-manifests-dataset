This extension allows Chromium-based browsers to be loaded in the background, giving you quick restarts and re-opens, as well as browser notification functionality without having an active window open.\n\nThe extension \"LightningReopen\" is archived, and is set to be removed in June 2024 (due to the use of the deprecated Manifest V2 format).\n\nLightning Reopen V3 is written with the new Manifest V3 standard, and will continuously be updated if the need arrives.\n\nThis extension has no access to your browsing data. It does not have any tracking or analytics functionality, will never be sold, and will always be fully open-sourced at https://github.com/Andrew6rant/LightningReopenV3\n\nLightning Reopen V3 is not compatible with non-chromium browsers such as Firefox, Safari, or Lynx. In addition, this extension is not needed on Edge (as Edge implements the functionality of this extension itself: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/startup-boost)."
