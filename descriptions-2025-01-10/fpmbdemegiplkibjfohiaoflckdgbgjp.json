Access from mobile or browser. Privately share with others. Choose who you share with.\n\nYou bumped into a cool web page, blog, article or whatever.\nAt this very moment you don't have enough time to explore it in detail. How often do you bookmark it or make a note about it, and then forget, and never come back?\n\nOr you found a new place, book, recipe, restaurant, or something else.\nAgain, you bookmark or make a note and it falls through the cracks. Lost forever.\n\nunforget.io is the solution. How does it work? It is very simple.\n* you bookmark web pages and make notes\n* once in a while, we select a few of your bookmarks or notes and email them to you as a reminder\n* you get to define how often (if ever) and how many bookmarks to send in each reminder email\n* the selection is rotated, so you are guaranteed to be reminded of all your bookmarks eventually\n* of course, if you are busy you can just ignore or delete the reminder email"
