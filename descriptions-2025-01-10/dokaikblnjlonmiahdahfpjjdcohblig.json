We forget to drink water and we also sit in a fixed and wrong position for a long period of time. This extension notifies you to blink, drink water, correct your posture and stretch.\n\nIf you use the computer for the entire day and follow the reminders you will feel your eyes less tired, you will be better hydrated and you won't feel any numbness.\n\nRecommended settings:\nDrink reminder - 45 minutes\nBlink reminder - 20 minutes\nStretch reminder - 90 minutes\nPosture reminder - 20 minutes"
