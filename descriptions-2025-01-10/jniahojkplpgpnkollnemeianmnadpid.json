I use this for my worm missions, snowager, and other time specific events.\n\nThis Chrome extension allows users to customize the appearance of the Neopets clock based on specific time intervals. Users can set the start time, end time, background color, and a clickable link for the clock. This feature-rich extension is designed to enhance the user experience on Neopets by providing a personalized interface.\n\nCredits\n\nThis extension is proudly designed and developed by GameDirection.net (https://gamedirection.net), an indie game studio and publishing company.

Set Your Preferences: For each desired customization:\n    - Specify the Start Time and End Time for when the customizations should apply.\n    - Choose a Background Color using the color picker.\n    - Enter a Link URL to make the clock clickable, directing to your specified URL.\n3. Add or Remove Settings: Click the \"+\" button to add more custom settings or the \"-\" button to remove them.\n4.
