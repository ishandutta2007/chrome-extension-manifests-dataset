Chexxo differentiates between the three quality classes defined by the CA/Browser Forum which are \"domain validated\", \"organization validated\" and \"extended validated\". If the quality of a websites certificate degrades Chexxo will block the domain and show a warning. This behaviour may be deactivated in the extension settings.\n\nSince Chromium based browsers do not provide an option to read the certificate from the webRequest-API, a server component is needed in order for Chexxo to function properly. Therefore, we have written a simple server which provides the extension with the certificate for the requested webpage.  You may host this server yourself, see https://github.com/Chexxo/Server for more information.\n\nPrivacy:\nThe server only gets the URL of the webpage which should be checked. The server logs only contain the URL, a UUID and the error if one occurred. The UUID is newly generated for every occurring error and cannot be traced back to a user unless you provide us with your local log for debugging purposes. This does not happen automatically therefore by default we cannot associate a URL with a user."
