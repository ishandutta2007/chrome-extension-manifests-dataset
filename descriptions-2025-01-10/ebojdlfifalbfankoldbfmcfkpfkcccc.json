Through this application you can save searches through Region or Country, as well as the TN's you are interested the most in order to apply to them afterwards through MyAIESEC.net.\n\nThis application requires you have access to MyAIESEC.net. If you don't have a valid email and password, you won't be able to use this software. Please contact your local committee in order to obtain a MyAIESEC.net account.\n\nIn order to use the application, just log in as you normally would to MyAIESEC.net. After a page loads properly, you will see a small Eddy in the URL. Click on it and you are ready to go.\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at jesus.aguinaga@aiesec.net\nFinally, feel free to review the source code at the Github Repository, fork it and send pull requests.\n\nHope it helps and saludos desde Mexico!\n-Jose Jesus Perez Aguinaga\nAIESEC Mexico LC OGX TMP Queretaro \n\n*DISCLAIMER: This tool is a software made in order to improve the experience of the portal. Any saved information is stored in your computer only and you are solely responsible for the use you give to it. By no means it saves any information from the AIESEC database to an external site or harms the portal neither your webpage. Yet, as with any software, it may have bugs that could reduce the performance of your browser that I won't make myself responsible of.
