It is a page action that allows users to calculate various statistics pertaining to the lengths of posts in a discussion on Canvas. Refer to the screen grabs for more information.\n\nAfter installing the extension, you'll to have refresh any Canvas webpages you already have open in order to see the page action next to the URL. If you don't have any Canvas webpages open, then you have nothing to worry about. Go ahead, open a discussion's page on Canvas, and use this extension.\n\nVersion 1.0.1 corrects a bug which made the size of the text appear uncomfortably small."
