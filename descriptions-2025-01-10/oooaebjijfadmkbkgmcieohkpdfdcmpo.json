Manage your issues by simply dragging and dropping between lists, and have it all synced within your team (real time updates coming soon). No need to use a separate project management tool.\n\nSimply get started by installing the application from the Chrome Store and then visiting the repository issues on Bitbucket which you want to work on. By clicking the \"Enable Bittask\" button it will generate the first list for you and put all your issues in there. You can create as many lists as you want using the \"+ Create List\" button on the top right. You can also rename or delete your lists later on.\n\nThe position and lists get shared across anyone also using the extension, so you can use this as part of your team. The updates are not yet realtime, so you will need to refresh the page to see the latest changes."
