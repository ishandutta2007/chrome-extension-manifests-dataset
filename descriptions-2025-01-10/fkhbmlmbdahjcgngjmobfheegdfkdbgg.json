Hide the video lengths, progress bar and times with this extension and enjoy your videos of online games or movies.\n\n::HOW IT WORKS::\n\n1) The extension will work for all the tabs on Chrome\n2)To temporarily disable the extension, is very easy, just type:\n\nchrome://extensions/\n\non the address bar and disable the extension there.\n\n::HOW CONTROL THE VIDEO ON YOUTUBE::\n\n1) Click on the video screen to set the controls up, now:\n2) To control and move forward/backwards in the VOD: Use Arrows keyboard (LEFT and RIGHT) for 5 secs\n3) To control and move forward/backwards in the VOD: Use Arrows keyboard (J and L). for 10 secs\n\nTIP: In order to move forward several minutes Hold the right key or the L key.\n\nAnother way to control and move forward/backwards: Its numbers. For example If you press 5, you will be watching the 50% of the video. If you press 3, you will be watching the 30% of the game. I dont recommend to use Numbers tho, i prefer to use LEFT & RIGHT (holding them ) to to avoid spoilers about the time"
