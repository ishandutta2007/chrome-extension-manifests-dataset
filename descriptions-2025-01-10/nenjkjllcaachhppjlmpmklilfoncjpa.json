It takes the page you are currently viewing, asks you a few questions about it and feeds it into the hoirzon scanning database.\n\nThis tool should only be used by BMT Employees.\n\nThe goal of horizon scanning, is not to try to accurately predict the future, but to identify, compile, and analyse the various signals of change.\n\nThese signals can be explored to stimulate thinking about the range of future possibilities.\n\nIt emphasizes “weak signals” or early indicators of potential change,\nIt emphasizes external trends and developments, and\nIt includes possible wild cards or low probability, high-impact events.\n\nThis Chrome extension allows users to find and share interesting articles with a simple click."
