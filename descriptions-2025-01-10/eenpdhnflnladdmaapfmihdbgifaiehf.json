No more Tab Tango. \n\nA command palette lets you search history, bookmarks and commands to speed up your browsing. Assign custom keyboard shortcuts to any history link or bookmark.\n\nIf you've got a wide or second monitor there's also a detached mode, so you can always have everything you need in plain sight. Switch tab groups, see all tabs and focus on the one you need.\n\nWhen you move your mouse over the sidebar it focusses it straight away for you - saving you the trouble of the extra click every time.\n\nPin your favourite websites to the top of the domain stack, so you can easily access them.\n\nDrag and drop tabs between groups or into a new group.\n\nDark mode available in settings.\n\nOptional new tab page (easy to disable) to see your open tabs by group and command palette to search. Searches default to google but also search your history.\n\nOptional setting to auto open new tabs in the same group as you're currently working in.\n\nOptional storing of closed groups to re-open later - your group history is saved in your bookmarks and if you have syncing switched on syncs across devices.\n\nSettings allow you to delete any data any time - sidestepper uses information from chrome, so can be restored or removed without any issues. \n\nKeyboard shortcuts:\nOpt + s - moves the tab to the sidebar, or back to the main window\nClick on a link while holding down the s key opens it in the sidebar or the main window\nOpt + k - open the drawer with the command palette ready to type\n\nLimitations:\nSidestepper won't work with incognito tabs\nSidestepper only has access to your active chrome profile\nOn initial install open tabs will not have thumbnails until you visit them - new tabs will be available straight away\n\nPrivacy\nWe don't store or share your data anywhere outside your browser or browser profile.\n\nAbout\nBuilt because life is too short to waste it clicking through your tabs to find what you're looking for or doing the tab flip flop back and forth trying to follow along. If you've got feedback we'd love to hear - just use the feedback form in the sidebar extension or send an email over to hello@sidestepper.io"
