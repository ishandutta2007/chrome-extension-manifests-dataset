Long gone are the days where your new tab is a glorified secondary search bar that was already at the top of the screen! Usher in a new era where your new tab allows you to auto search popular websites like YouTube, Wikipedia and Amazon! Your new tab compartmentalizes the entire internet into 8 categories and gives you instant organized access to the most important links in today's world!  Master Vitalize, master the internet! \n\n\nYou should use Vitalize for many reasons, but one big one: why not? This isn't some cliche term, Vitalize improves the new tab almost unarguably because before, the new tab was just a big white screen."
