Many accounts now posting in r/wallstreetbets are several years old but have large gaps in post histories and never posted in r/wallstreetbets, which means they were likely bought.\n\nThis extension adds a flair next to a user's name in r/wallstreetbets that shows how long they have participated in the subreddit for. Using this information, you can make a better choice about whether a user is trustworthy or not or whether a user is a spam bot."
