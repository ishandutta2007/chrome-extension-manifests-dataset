It’s that simple. You click, then click again and all your tabs are safe as long as you keep them in that bookmarks folder. \n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, Tabulous lets you instantly recreate where you left off with a relaunch button. Just select relaunch then select the folder you saved your tabs to and Tabulous™ launches those saved tabs at the same time, bringing you back to where you were when you saved. It's as if you never left that giant mess of creativity and learning behind. \n\nSo go ahead, shut down your Chrome browser before it crashes because it’s been going non-stop for two weeks. And feel free to restart your computer. Tabulous™ has you covered."
