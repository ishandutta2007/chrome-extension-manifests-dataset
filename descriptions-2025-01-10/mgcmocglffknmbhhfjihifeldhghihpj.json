It uses advanced AI threat detection and a collaborative network of users to block dangerous websites and protect you from phishing attacks, scams, and bad downloads.\nWe believe in rewarding the community for making the internet safer. In the future, you will be able to enable blockchain connection and earn $ILOCK rewards for sharing security data and training our AI when it misclassifies a site.\n\nKey features\n • Instant protection from browser-based threats: dangerous websites, phishing attacks, and bad downloads\n • AI Threat Detection recognizes novel URLs and dangerous sites in real-time\n • Easy one-click installation\n • Power of the community: future rewards for keeping the community safe and a referral system to keep our movement growing\n\nWhat makes ThreatSlayer special?\nMost security products use static databases, so they’re unable to detect attacks in real time. ThreatSlayer is proactive. It doesn’t wait for trouble to find you: it finds trouble first.\nThreatSlayer’s AI works by comparing a list of trusted and untrusted websites to a trained system called a classifier. The classifier uses supervised learning to understand the differences between safe and dangerous sites and can accurately identify potential threats in real-time to keep you safe online.\nMoreover, ThreatSlayer combines the power of the Web3 community and AI to crowdsource security. By leveraging collective input from users, ThreatSlayer continuously improves its threat detection capabilities, making the internet a safer place for everyone.\n\nHow much does it cost?\nThreatSlayer is open-source and completely free to use. Not only that, but in the future, you will be able to earn rewards for using it!\n\nWhat data does ThreatSlayer collect?\nThreatSlayer collects no personal information. The only data it sends is a URL, which we then scan with our threat-detecting AI. ThreatSlayer saves anonymized URLs that cannot be associated with any individual user.\nBy installing this extension to your browser, you confirm you read and agree to Interlock’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which govern your download and use of the product.\n\nRecent changes \n • KYC verification\n • Security stacking\n • $ILOCK claim is now possible"
