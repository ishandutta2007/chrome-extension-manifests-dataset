But it is a pet peeve of mine. So, I'm sharing this in case somebody happens to also find this incredibly annoying,\n\nThis extension adds a visual cue shown when dragging a file into the browser window. \n\n- When the website ACCEPTS drag and dropping a file, the cursor will have a green label next to it\n- When the website DOES NOT accept the drag and drop, and therefore if you drop files it will open them in a separate window, the cursor will have a red label saying \"NO DROP\".\n\nHopefully this makes the web a bit more user-friendly and accessible for some."
