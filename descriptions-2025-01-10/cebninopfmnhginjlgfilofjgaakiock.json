Simple 2-step process: on the web page with data that you want to export, click the ultraball. All tables will be extracted from the page along with download buttons to export as CSV.  Click the \"Download as CSV\" button to download the HTML table as a CSV spreadsheet.  Saves all column headers and as much formatting as is available for CSV-formatted spreadsheets.\n\nIf you need to get fancy with it and edit your spreadsheets before exporting, you may want to try \"Instant Data Scraper\" (no affiliation).  This extension is barebones, vanilla JavaScript without any extra bells and/or whistles, in order to make your workflow as streamlined as possible."
