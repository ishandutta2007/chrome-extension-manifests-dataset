With a whitelisting regex system, you can easily restrict this tool to hosts that you are authorized to scan.\n\nIt works by searching for files with a given path on the current URL path and all parent paths, applying given regex to the results to check for proof positive of a vulnerable location. If the path returns 200 and matches the regex, it's flagged as vulnerable and alerts you. All rules are run on all directories in a set of time-staggered background XHR requests, so network throughput remains high at all times.\n\nBishop comes with a set of rules that hunt for the lowest hanging fruit, but the rule system is entirely extensible - rules are regular expressions that are run on specified directories, so if you can turn it into a regex, Bishop will look for it.\n\nBishop is intended SOLELY for legal use on web servers that you control or are permitted to scan, and the developers are not responsible for how you choose to use this software.\n\nBishop is MIT licensed and open source; contribute at https://github.com/jkingsman/bishop."
