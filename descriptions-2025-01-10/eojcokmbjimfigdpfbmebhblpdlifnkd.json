Many people hide behind the screen of a monitor, causing harm and inflicting pain on others in everyday life. We aim to overcome this issue. Our project is not about stopping those who leave hurtful comments. Instead, it focuses on giving them a chance to think again. Itâ€™s not about preventing them from trying to hurt others, but rather providing an opportunity for reflection. ðŸŒ± **One sentence from someone can impact another person.** We strive for a better internet networking cultureâ€”ethically. Now. _\"Why don't you be more nicer?\"_"
