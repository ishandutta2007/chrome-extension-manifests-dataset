In order to see the score, users must be viewing a product page (as opposed to a search page or other)\n\nScores are calculated on 4 categories:\n1. Environmental Sustainability\n2. Social Impact\n3. Innovation\n4. Product Quality\n\nBy breaking down the way a company conducts its business into the four categories, we help you make better choices about which company you give your money to. We all have a responsibility to fight unnecessary pollution, human rights abuses and the inefficient use of resources.\n\nWe are releasing this extension in order to test the assumptions we have made and to see if there is interest from the broader public for an easy way to be a more ethical consumer. We are trying to change the way our consumption spending affects the planet. We would love to hear your feedback, please write to us:\ninfo@earthratings.com\n\nFor more information about us and our mission, visit:\nwww.earthratings.com"
