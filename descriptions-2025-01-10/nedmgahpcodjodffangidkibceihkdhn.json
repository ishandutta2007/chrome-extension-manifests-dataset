Just click the game icon to open the game in a popup and begin. The game does not open in a new tab.\n\nWith a cleaner look and more reliable and accurate features, Connect 4 is a great option to play when bored while surfing the web!\n\nPlay Four in a Row together with your friends and family!\n\nOn your turn, simply click any spot in the desired column to drop your piece. The two players are red and yellow, and red always goes first. The turn is designated on the screen and the computer will automatically detect when someone gets four of their pieces in a row. Click \"New Game\" to reset the Connect 4 board, and click \"Undo\" in case you misclick on your turn. Please note, you may only undo the most recent move.\n\nUPDATES:\nVersions 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 - More bug fixes and improvements\nVersion 1.2 - \"Undo\" button bug fixes and improvements\nVersion 1.1 - New Feature: \"Undo\" button!"
