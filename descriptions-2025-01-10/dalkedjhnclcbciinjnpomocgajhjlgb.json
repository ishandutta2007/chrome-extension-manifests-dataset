Women are typically paid 20% less than men, and that rate is even lower for minority women groups. Originally launched on April 4, Equal Pay Day 2017, Lady Dollars lets you see how much it actually costs to be a woman. \n\nVisit aauw.org to learn more about pay inequality.\n \nLady Dollars is an independent project, produced in collaboration with the American Association of University Women. Founded more than 135 years ago, AAUW is the nationâ€™s leading voice promoting equity and education for women and girls."
