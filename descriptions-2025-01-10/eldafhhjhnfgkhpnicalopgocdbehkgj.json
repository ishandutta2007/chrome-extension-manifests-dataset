This extension considers the last activity of the card, what might be a comment, attachment, anything who left a log inside the card.\nThe aging is applied in 3 states, at 7, 14, or 28 days without any action in the card. \n\nThis project is open-source, feel free to contribute or make a suggestion:\nhttps://github.com/fernand-o/trello-card-aging"
