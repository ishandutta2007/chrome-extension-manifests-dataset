This simple extension aims to help individuals with health anxiety be more mindful while using Google.\n\nThe extension scans Google’s search results and meta-information on open webpages for triggering illness-related keywords. If any are detected, the corresponding results will be blocked. There are over 3,000 keywords built-in, but you can also add new keywords or remove existing ones from the list.\n\nPlease note that the pre-existing list of keywords is not exhaustive and may not detect every illness-related search result or webpage.\n\nWhen adding the extension, you may see a \"proceed with caution\" warning. This is only because the extension needs to read the data of the webpages you visit to determine if they contain triggering keywords."
