This extension completely changes how you experience Banner. Besides navigating between your courses much faster, you can display all your courses side by side and organize them as you wish. You will also get a list of Core Curriculum courses by category (Pathways I, Humanities , etc.) offered in the semester you choose. You can simply select the sections that you want in each course, and the ones that are clashing will be unavailable to choose and noted clearly.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the extension is to make it so easy for you to make a schedule that you will be encouraged to discover what is possible with your schedule for the upcoming semester.\n\nThis extension gives us the ability to tailor a new Banner on top of the existing one and add anything that we would like to, so feedback is much appreciated."
