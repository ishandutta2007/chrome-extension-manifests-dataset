This tool made for the Chrome browser will work in any production Workday tenant and will let you customize some key elements of the standard Absence Balance screen to your own preference so that it becomes easier to read and understand, for you.\n\nEasy as 1,2,3\n\n3 easy steps to make it work:\nGo to your Absence Balance screen in Workday\nClick the Extension’s button in the top right toolbar\nClick anywhere in your table when it turns light yellow\n\nConvert Hours to Days\n\nYou can select the number of hours you are working per day and all amounts in hours will then be divided by this number. The end result is a table with balance numbers in days instead of hours. If your numbers are already in days, then feel free to skip this step.\n\nConfigure Extra Columns\n\nYou can configure as many extra columns that make sense to you and to your organization’s tenant.  These columns are calculations based on existing numeric columns.  You can, for example, add a new column that will be the sum of columns 1 and 3.  You could also do column 9 minus column 1 if it makes sense to you.  You can also specify a custom label to each column.  Extra columns will appear white a light yellow background in the Absence Balance table.\n\nCustomize Absence Balance Table\n\nYou can customize the look and feel of your Absence Balance screen.  You can choose to hide certain columns that you do not wish to see or that are not important for you. You can also enter a custom label of your choice for any column.\n\nSpeaks your language\n\nThis extension was designed to adapt to french and english language tenants.  It will appear in the same language as your tenant.  For other languages it will probably not work right, but tell me about it.\n\nFollows you where you go\n\nAll these selections and configurations are stored locally in the browser storage space, as long as you click those Save buttons of course. Each time you fire up the extension, your Absence Balance Table will look exactly the same. It will also be shared between any opened Chrome browser as long as you are connected to your Chrome account."
