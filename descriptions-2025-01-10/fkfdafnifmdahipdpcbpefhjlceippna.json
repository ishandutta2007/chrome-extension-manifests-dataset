I believe that the most empowering tools are invisible. \n\nFeatures:\n* show short text snippets for Wikipedia's internal entries when hover\n* turn section titles into in-page links for easier bookmarking and sharing particular sections\n* enlarge images when hover\n  * zoom level is adjustable\n  * adjusted enlarged image placement for right-to-left language pages\n\nThis is an open-source software.
