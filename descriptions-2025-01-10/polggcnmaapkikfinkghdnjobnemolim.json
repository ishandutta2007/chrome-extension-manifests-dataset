This extension will automatically delete sites in your browser history based on keywords you specify.\n\nNever be embarrassed by your browser history again!\n\nJust enter the keywords you want to be deleted on the settings page. If you visit a site with any of those keywords in the title or URL it won't show in your browser history. Downloads that match those keywords will also be automatically removed from your history (but the file won't be deleted).\n\nThis extension is completely private and doesn't store any data about you or the sites you visit. It also doesn't modify any of the sites you visit.\n\nUp to 2 keywords are absolutely free to use forever but if you want unlimited keywords there is $10 one-time charge. This is to be able to make it worthwhile to keep developing and maintaining the extension â€” it's a lot of work to make good extensions!"
