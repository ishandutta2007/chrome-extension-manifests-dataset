However, in today's fast-paced and distracting world, it can be challenging to stick to this commitment despite having made it multiple times.\n\nTo motivate you to tackle the daily Leetcode challenge, we have developed this extension. Instead of sending reminders, it will automatically redirect you to Leetcode until you have completed the problem of the day.\n\nWhat is the function of this extension?\n\n1. After installing, if you browse anything on chrome and you have not solved the problem for a day it will redirect to that. Basically, it's virtual implementation of the principles outlined in book 'Eat That Frog'.\n2. In case of an urgent need to browse, the extension includes an emergency button that can be used once per day to temporarily disable the redirection to Leetcode for a period of 3 hours.\n3. You have the option to choose between two modes: redirecting yourself to the daily Leetcode challenge or to any problem on Leetcode. This is beneficial for users who are beginners and those who are on their way to becoming pro and do not want to solve the daily Leetcode challenge.\n\nWhat's new in version 2.0.6\n1. There appears to be an issue with the extension not functioning properly on the new UI of Leetcode. If you are experiencing this issue, we recommend switching back to the old UI. In order to assist with this, we have included instructions in the extension popup on how to switch back to the old UI.\n \nWhat's new in version 2.0.5\n1. Now Leetcode Forcing For Mode Daily Leetcode Challenge will happen according to UTC 12 AM as daily leetcode problem changes accordingly.\n2. Minor bugs are fixed."
