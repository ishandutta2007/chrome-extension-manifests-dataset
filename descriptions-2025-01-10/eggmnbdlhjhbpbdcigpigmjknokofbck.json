This isn’t football time,\nit’s the moment of festivities, cheese and wine.\n\nIt’s about time Christmas clapped back at football,\nfor it’s sucking the yuletide from one and all.\n\nThe plugin, the plugin, oh what does it do?\nMakes footie news festive just for you!\n\nRonaldo, Mbappé, Trippier too,\ngone are their names, christmassified anew.\n\nThe beautiful game, xmas vibes low,\nmade more festive with the addition of snow.\n\nOh joy, oh praise, who to credit for such a thing?\nWhy it is Mother London’s name you should sing!"
