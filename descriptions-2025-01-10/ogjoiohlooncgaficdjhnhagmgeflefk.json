The extension pulls data from RateMyProfessors.com and when the extension is activated, it scrapes the visible professors listed on the class registration page, matches them with their corresponding ratings, and displays the relevant information in an organized manner. This helps students make informed decisions when selecting courses on the spot. And if the student needs more information about the professor, they can simply click on their name which takes them directly to the website. \nThis is how to use the extension:\n1. When you're on your registration page and selecting a section for a class, make sure the Schedule type column is properly showing(the type could be anything other than discussion/recitation)\n2. Now click on the extension and it should work according to the description."
