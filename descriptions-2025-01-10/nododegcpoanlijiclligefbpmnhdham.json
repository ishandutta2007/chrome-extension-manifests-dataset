Stop opening zoom to grab your link and paste it in a calendar invite. Stop digging through your support portal to send customers help articles.\n\nUplink lets you save links so you can have them on hand to paste anywhere. This allows you to quit getting interrupted by the context shift required to go and find these links every time you need to copy them.\n\nWe made Uplink because it was annoying that I had to open zoom to put the link to a call on a calendar invite. I used to have to scroll through our calendar software and copy the link to a specific calendar before sending it to a customer. Now the calendar links for my personal calendar, our sales team, and our support team are clearly labeled and on hand in Uplink.\n\nHereâ€™s how it works: Right click on any link and select copy to UpLink to add it to your link storage. You will then be able to view the links using Ctrl+Shift+Y for windows or Command+Shift+Y for mac. To create a hyperlink for an email double click a word and use the keyboard shortcut then select the link you would like to insert. You can copy any link by simply clicking on it in UpLink. To delete or rename a link double click it and then click the delete or rename button. You can grab the current url and store it in your link storage using the commands Ctrl+Shift+5 for windows and Command+Shift+U for mac."
