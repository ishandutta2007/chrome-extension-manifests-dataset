We’re an easy to use application that’s built on the principle that people want to work with and do business with those who they know, like and trust.\n\nToday, we believe it’s time for what we call a “relationship reset” where we recognise that people in communities where the “bridge of trust” has been built will best achieve the results they want.\n\nEverywhere, professionals of all types repeatedly tell us how challenging it is to gain new clients. They say their ability to have meaningful conversations with the people who could use their services is being obstructed by increased online noise and digital marketing of all kinds. We make contact and immediately we are flooded by sales automation, bots, funnel marketers, and all kinds of unwanted messaging seeking to break into our space.\n\nIt’s common that the people we could help the most have put up barriers from the noise, thus preventing us from reaching them. More we hear so much about the digital overwhelm people experience and the inefficiencies of traditional marketing that it’s now time to return to what has always worked.\n\nWe believe the only sustainable solution to these issues comes by building highly engaged, focused, personal relationships with a small group of people who are committed to working together to help each other grow.\n\nWe’ve proven that doing this, systematically and repeatedly, leads to many doors and opportunities opening that we’re previously closed. With this focus, you can break through the chatter and produce a continuous flow of new, high-quality introductions, referrals, and sales.\n\nThis extension was created to do just that! It’s a simple software tool built on the timeless foundations that say when you approach relationship building by focusing first on creating a “bridge of trust,” then purposeful problem solving and needs focused conversations easily follow.\n\nMore as you build these relationships with a few, you set yourself apart in your marketplace and become a scarce, attractive force, creating personal influence, and drawing people and opportunity towards you.\n\nWith this app, it’s clear that by investing just 10-15 minutes a day doing the right things to attract people into close, committed, “engaged” personal relationships, they’ll respond and become clients, referrers, and powerful advocates for you.\n\nThe process begins with selecting a few people to focus on from your networks or from people you connect with online. Then, it automates keeping in touch on a consistent schedule that builds “top of mind” awareness and starts the trust-building cycle.\n\nImportant in this cycle is the commitment on making each contact one that concentrates on the other person’s goals, interests, hobbies, family, etc. The extension has a unique AI-enabled tool that serves up information on each person’s interests to use conversationally in a user’s communications. Showing you care about the person’s interests first, always leads to the doors of trust opening and more substantive discovery and collaboration then can happen.\n\nIn bringing this Chrome extension to you, we’re helping you to bring the people you meet or follow in LinkedIn into the EngagePro tools where you can personalise your conversations, better schedule and automate staying on track with the engagement building steps and achieve the results you’re seeking.\n\nJust imagine never having to worry about where your next new client is going to come from. Or imagine, never letting the important people or clients you’ve already served slip away “through the cracks” of your busyness. Or think about how valuable it would be to now bring the people you’re connected with or following in LinkedIn into an easy to use relationship focused, success building tool. That’s EngagePro!"
