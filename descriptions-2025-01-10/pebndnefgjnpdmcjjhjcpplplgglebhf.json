Install it to find out why you were navigating the internet wrong! What happens next will surprise you!\n\nI know, you too are tired of clickbaits!\n\nThere’s nothing worse than clicking on an interesting title and then getting a mediocre story at best.\n\nYou’ll never believe what happened when…\nThis is the cutest thing ever…\nThis the biggest mistake you can make…\nTake this quiz to see which character you are on…\n\nThey are all classic clickbait models. There’s no singular way to craft clickbait, but the essence is clear: Lure readers to your site.\n\nClickBait Blocker is trying to hide away those awful articles with the support of users like you. The majority of time you realize that it was going to be clickbait but, yeah, you clicked it anyway. These guys got you, again. You couldn’t resist and you know it. Why not help others avoid falling for the same trap? So simply mark that article as clickbait and then all the users will see it for what it really is.\n\nBut what if I'm subjective? you're asking. Indeed, some man's junk is another man's treasure. If a user decided that the article is not clickbait he'll vote it accordingly. You'll see all the votes and you'll have the possibility to choose the level of relevance (confirmed clickbaits subtracted by denied clickbaits) upon which the article is to be considered clickbait.\n\nPlus, leverage the power of artificial intelligence with our latest feature! Now, you can easily summarize an article straight from the page without navigating to it, thanks to our AI technology. This saves you a lot of time and helps you avoid clickbaits altogether.\n\nAdd domains to whitelist, add custom relevance for custom domains, personalize it the way you want so you can enjoy the internet again!"
