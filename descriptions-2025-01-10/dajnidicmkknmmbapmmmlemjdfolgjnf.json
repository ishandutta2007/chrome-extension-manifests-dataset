No account is required. \n\nTo all marketers. I'm not interested in commercializing any of my extensions. Do not call or email me about it, please. All such offers will be reported as spam.\n\nIf you appreciate my work, buy me a coffee https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dweorh :)\n\n'OSINT'\nIn times of the massive amount of fake news, I added a new feature OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).\nIn that section, I will place all links that may help to verify the current video.\nWe start by searching thumbnails in Google and TinEye search engines.\nYou can also capture a current frame of the video, download it, or click the right mouse button using google lenses or any other extension you have installed.\nIf you know any services that can be linked there, leave them in a comment, please.\nAs requested on Twitter, there is an option to download chat content from live videos. To retrieve the full chat, the tab with the video needs to be open at the beginning of the video, otherwise downloaded chat may be incomplete.\n\n'Video Speed'\nAre some videos too slow? YT Booster has a slide bar to change the speed of the video up to x16!\nUse keyboard to change the speed. Buttons +/- will modify speed, = will reset to the default one.\n\n'Audio normalization'\nSome videos are very quiet, while others are very loud. This feature allows you to set a reference audio loudness and then automatically reduce the volume of excessively loud videos.\n\n'Disable auto pause'\nAllows you to manage auto pause of the videos, when you watch/listen long playlists.\n\n'Cards'\nCards can be visible all the time, so you can see what else the creator prepared for you :-) To make them visible check 'Cards' checkbox in the menu next to your URL bar.\n\n'Keywords'\nIf you are a creator and you are wondering what keywords other creators use for their productions, now you have easy access to them.\nAs a viewer, maybe you are interested in topics meant as a keyword by your favorite YouTuber. Now there are links to instant search. Easy click&explore :-)\n\n'Chapters'\nThat section displays chapters from the video, if available. Currently playing chapter is highlighted on the list to make navigation easier. There is a button to add any of the chapters as your Marker.\n\n'Markers'\nThat feature allows you to create personal markers for videos. Click 'Add' in the 'Markers' section, add a few words of description and save. Now you have quick access to that particular moment in the video. You can also organize your Markers using Tags. \n\n'YT Orchestra'\nHave you ever experienced the nightmare of all chrome tabs playing simultaneously just because the OS did update & restart?\nIf you are like me, with a few dozens of YT tabs open, you can feel that pressure to find them all playing...\nNow, YT Orchestra allows you to 'play only one video.' Once one video starts playing, all others will be paused. \nAlso, at the bottom of 'YT Booster's frame, all YT tabs are listed with status and simple video control, and quick links to those tabs. \n\nOthers\nI hope you will find a few other features helpful, like flip videos horizontally or vertically, and screens that usually appear at the end of the video.\n\nYou have two export options in the 'Import & Export' section.\nOne is a simple export of Markers to a text file.\nThe second export is for backup purposes, the same as an import. Here you can import exported .json file. It allows you to move data between browsers or keep it as a backup :-)\n\nBesides the standard export, you can copy marker(s) to the clipboard by clicking the clipboard icon.\nThat one next to '+' in Markers will copy the current timestamp and video title to your clipboard.\nThe icon next to the video thumbnail on the Markers list will copy all markers from that video.\nAnd finally, the icon next to the 'delete' icon will copy details of the particular entry.\n\n\nPS. There is neither registration nor tracking. Everything is stored in your browser. If you uninstall this extension or cleanup caches of your browser, your list of markers will be removed permanently. Prons & cons of anonymous usage ;-)\n\nPS2.
