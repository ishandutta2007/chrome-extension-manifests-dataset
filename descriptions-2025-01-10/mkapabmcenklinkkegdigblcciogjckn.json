If you have data collected from different sites which either has different variables or was collected in a time course then `ili is a tool of choice for interactive visualization of maps corresponding to the variables or time points. \n\nExamples and documentation are available at our website. (See the link below)\n\n`ili is developed by the Alexandrov team at European Molecular Biology Laboratory. It is already used for studying metabolites and microbes on the human skin, molecules on wings of a bee, natural products of cyanobacteria from the whole world, and metabolites on leaves of a tomato plant from a backyard. `ili is open-source so get in touch if you have questions!"
