One-Click Submit will automate this for you!\n\nThis free extension automatically clicks on the fields that have been autocompleted which unblocks several forms. All these forms where you had to manually click or make a small edit to the text to be able to submit can now be submitted in a single click. \nWith the colour feature, you can also set your own background colour for autocompleted fields to be able to keep track of which fields have been updated.\n\nThis extension will be mostly useful for Google autocomplete forms but will also work for any other autocompleted fields that you might have. \nThe algorithm checks the type of input as well as the 'autocompleted' status of the input fields. \n\nEnjoy and please leave a comment if you have any remarks or issues."
