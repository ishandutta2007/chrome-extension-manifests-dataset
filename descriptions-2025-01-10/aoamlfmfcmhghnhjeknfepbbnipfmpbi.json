Thats the whole point. Data is being used by the extension but stored in your machine. So the long answer is technically job site (browser tab) data is being collected for local processing but NOT SHARED or uploaded.\n**\n\nKeep a log of your applied or interested jobs from across the web as a CSV on your local machine. No sign-up, no BS. \n\nAuto captures key job information from the job page via web scraping. You can edit or delete any scraped data. \n\nMust have a job description (full page) open. Works on any major job boards such as LinkedIn, Indeed etc (yes even MyWorkdayJobs).\n\nDeveloped for my personal convenience over a weekend. Proved to be very useful and saved me a lot of time trying to keep track of applied jobs. I'm publishing it so others may use it. Most job tracking services complicate things with too many features, sign-ups, premium tier etc so if you need specifically just to keep a list of jobs in a CSV, this should be useful to you.\n\nFeel free to contact me/comment any bugs/issues you find. Thank you!"
