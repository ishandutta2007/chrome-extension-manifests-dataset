It combines a site-blocker with a to-do list, two crucial components to keep you on task. If you try and access a site on your block-list, you are instead redirected to your to-do list. \n\nThe design is efficient and simple, and so are the buttons, which are all located in the upper right hand corner. The one furthest to the right switches between your to-do list and site-blocker. The one in the middle determines how your task list will be organized. (Up arrow means most recent task goes on top, down arrow means it goes on the bottom, alphabetical means it is organized alphabetically). The one on the left clears your task list. \n\nThis was coded by a high school student over a few days, so it might have a few bugs! I did my best to check it, but if there are any problems let me know in a review! This extension really helped me stay on task as a student, and I hope it will do the same for you! \n\nIf you like it feel free to leave a nice rating :)"
