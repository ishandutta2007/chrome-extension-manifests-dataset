Look no further than Cashtic Peer ATM Network! Our companion Chrome extension allows you to easily check for nearby ATMs in any city. Simply install the extension, and you'll have the convenience of locating the nearest ATMs at your fingertips.\n\nCashtic empowers you to ask nearby users for cash when, and once you connect with someone willing to assist, you can arrange a meeting to receive the cash. The app lets you specify how you'll settle the received cash, eg through bank transfer or some other money transfer app.\n\nSafety is our priority, and Cashtic recommends arranging meetings in front of police stations or guarded areas for added security. Notably, Cashtic does not currently facilitate money transfers; it's a platform for users to connect and exchange cash in person.\n\nWhy share cash with others? Cashtic turns users into walking ATMs, creating a distributed mobile smartphone ATM network. You can even earn money by charging a commission, similar to how banks operate with traditional ATMs.\n\nThe app's process is simple:\n1. Request cash and specify a location and time.\n2. Receive notifications from nearby users.\n3. Review and accept offers.\n4. Confirm the meeting details through chat.\n5. Meet in person to exchange cash.\n6. Transfer the agreed amount via your preferred money transfer app, with a commission (0-10%) applied based on the other user's settings.\n\nAs our user base grows, we aim to make finding cash even more accessible than traditional ATMs from major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, HSBC, PNC, and more. Invite your friends to join Cashtic, and together we can achieve this goal.\n\nFor more information, please refer to our Terms of Service [https://cashtic.com/terms.html] and Privacy Policy [https://cashtic.com/privacy.html]. Experience the convenience of Cashtic and revolutionize the way you access cash!"
