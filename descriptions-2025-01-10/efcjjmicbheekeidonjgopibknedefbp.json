Hence you might want to set the desired keyboard shortcuts again in the keyboard shortcut settings in the Chrome Extensions page.\nAlternatively, navigate to chrome://extensions/shortcuts from your address bar to change shortcuts.\n\n\nThis extension is a fork of a project, made open source in GitHub: \nhttps://github.com/harshayburadkar/clut-chrome-extension\n\nOriginal extension:\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clut-cycle-last-used-tabs/cobieddmkhhnbeldhncnfcgcaccmehgn\n\nFork link:\nhttps://github.com/SornrasakC/clut-chrome-extension\n(The main purpose is to migrate this extension to Manifest V3)\n\nDefault Keys*: \nALT+W: Quick switch\nALT + S: Normal switch \nALT + Shift + S: Normal switch (in opposite direction)\n*Keys can be changed in keyboard shortcut settings on the Chrome extensions page.\n\n\n\n=Quick switch=: \nUse for rapid switching to last tab (by pressing once) or to the second to last used tab(by pressing rapidly twice) and so on.\n\n=Normal switch=: \nUse when you want to look for a tab recently used but when you would want to go in a slower pace (needing to glimpse for a bit to see if it is the page you need)\n\nMost other extensions meant to accomplish the same thing don’t work well since there are some limitations/difficulties in the Chrome API. This extension uses some basic algorithms and timers of intervals between key presses to get over these problems. That is the reason there is separate keys for quick and slower switches with different timer settings.\n\nFeatures:\n* Can cycle through ALL open tabs from all Chrome windows in a most recently used order\n* Extension DOES NOT need access to any of your visited website's data\n* Can work through tabs across different Chrome windows\n* Snappy and fast switches\nNew* Options to only cycle tabs on current active window\n\nFAQ:\n\n- Why are there two sets of shortcuts one for quick switch and one for a slower switch. Isn’t it possible to simplify like ALT+TAB behavior ?\nA: There are some restrictions in Chrome API which makes it difficult to implement this feature in the most natural way. The intention was to make this extension work as close to Alt+Tab in Windows (or Cmd+Tab for Mac). Unfortunately due to these limitations though, this extension relies on time intervals in between your key presses. That is the reason there is a concept of quick switch (faster timer) and a normal switch (slower timer).\n\n- Where can I change the shortcut key for switching tabs ?\nA: To change shortcut, go to the Extensions pane in your Chrome browser. Press the menu icon \n and find the Keyboard Shortcuts option in the list. You can change keyboard shortcuts of your installed extensions and apps here.  \n\nAlternatively, you can access and change extension keyboard shortcuts by going to this special address from your browser address bar.\nchrome://extensions/shortcuts\n\nNote: Few shortcuts may be not allowed to be set by Chrome if Chrome itself uses that shortcut or the shortcut is needed for system level operations.\n\n\nFeel free to post feedback, comments and suggestions."
