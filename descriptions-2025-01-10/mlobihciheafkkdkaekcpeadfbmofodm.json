Curious about the 'personality' of your favorite song? Do you just want something pretty and new to look at? Install this extension, hit cmd/ctrl + shift + U, and enjoy the show!\n\nAudioforma listens to the audio you have playing in your web browser, and translates the notes it hears into a beautiful visual rendering against the circle of fifths. \n\nYou can choose various color scales for your visual: options like Rainbow, Cubehelix, Inferno and Purple\n\nAudioforma DOES NOT listen to you, or your microphones. This extension is built to \"listen\" to the audio internally before it reaches your speakers."
