This tool provides various utilities that significantly improve your productivity and streamline your workflow. \n\nOne of the primary features of this extension is its ability to generate clamp CSS expressions. This is facilitated through an intuitive interface where users can input minimum and maximum viewport widths, as well as corresponding font sizes. The extension takes care of the calculation and provides a clamp expression which helps ensure responsive font sizing across different viewport sizes. This is particularly useful for modern web development, where designing for a multitude of devices with varying screen sizes is a must.\n\nThe extension also features a performance utility that can be toggled on or off. This feature presumably alters the performance settings of the Breakdance builder to suit the user's preferences, potentially optimizing resource usage or enabling additional functionalities. \n\nLastly, this utility tool houses a \"Global Style Kit\" which can be activated with a button. This kit can be understood as a set of predefined styles that can be applied universally across your project, thereby promoting design consistency and reducing repetitive coding efforts.\n\nMoreover, the extension provides a convenient way to copy text content from a JSON file directly to your clipboard with a single click. The user interface is interactive with a variety of buttons that trigger specific actions and display corresponding visual feedback. \n\nEach of these features is designed to fit seamlessly into your workflow, offering time-saving functionalities right at your fingertips. Enhance your Breakdance builder experience with the \"Moreblocks Utility\" extension."
