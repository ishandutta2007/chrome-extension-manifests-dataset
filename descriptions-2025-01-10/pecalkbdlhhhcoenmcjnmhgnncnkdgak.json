This is useful for testing features that rely on the visitor's GeoIP location, such as Personalization. Additionally, the extension provides the ability to clear Sitecore-specific cookies. By clicking \"New Contact\", Sitecore treats you as a first time visitor, whereas, clicking \"New Visit\" clears your current session and is the equivalent to a repeat visit."
