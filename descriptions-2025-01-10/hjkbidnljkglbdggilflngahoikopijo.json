This extension binds Alt+C/Option+C to copy the current tab's url and automatically create a hyperlink with it! From there, you can paste wherever you want and never have to worry about huge links clogging your chats ever again.\n\nLinkit currently supports most text/chat based programs like Slack, Teams, Docs, Word, etc., however due to restrictions in how chat works, will not currently work in Discord."
