Basically, when you go on a channel page, you will be able to see the outlier ratio immediately and see which outperforming videos stand out at a quick glance. No need to do mental calculations every time you do research.\n\n**1 of 10 Thumbnail Viewer**\n\nPreview your thumbnail directly on [youtube.com](http://youtube.com) quick and easy. \n\nThe goal of this feature is to help finalize the decision on which thumbnail to use for the next video a youtube channel will upload.\n\nHow it works: You can upload one thumbnail and will be able to see the thumbnail concept directly on youtube.com. No need to go on a separate website.\n\nThis will allow you to more clearly understand from a viewerâ€™s perspective how the designed thumbnail will be seen. You can preview from the youtube homepage, suggested section and even on a channel.\n\n- You can add more thumbnail variations to see side by side.\n- You can choose to randomize the position. These options will allow you to see which thumbnail pops out more amongst other thumbnails on youtube.\n- You can also change the title of the video and the name of the channel for better representation of what the video will look like on the homepage.\n\nCredit to @benjamincode and @bastiui for the thumbnail preview chrome extension concept.\n\n**Privacy**\n\nWe don't collect, store, or share any of your personal information. \nEverything operates locally on your browser, ensuring your data stays with you and never leaves your device."
