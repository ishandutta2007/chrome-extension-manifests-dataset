Last segment still needs the timer to be stopped in order to be modified.\n\nv1.4\n---------------\n- Add mute/unmute notification checkbox & functionality\n- Fix blacklist when going from one blacklisted site to another\n\nv1.3\n---------------\n- Add blacklist switch in options\n\nv1.2\n---------------\n- Custom labels on switch depending on switch state (in options)\n- Add busy state to avoid auto break during meetings , etc..\n- Add button to change segment status (to modify status of each segment after timer is stopped)\n\nKnown problems\n---------------\n- Wake up functionality is sometimes triggered automatically when the timer is stopped. Should only be triggered once and then should not be used. Might need a storage sync to fix..."
