This allows the extension to take advantage of `captureVisibleTab` which allows you to see screenshots of your open windows (reference - https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs). No data is being had. \n\nUpdate Log\n\n0.9.7: \nBug fix: regression bug for pinned tabs fixed \n\n0.9.6: \nBug fix: bonus button is now fixed (as well as join). Also popping off pinned tabs stay pinned!\n\n0.9.5:\nBug fix: popping off tab on single window no longer causes a glitch in the matrix\n\n0.9.4:\nWe heard all of your feedback and now we are happy to announce that Tabbo supports pinned tabs!"
