More technically, Ferret is a Chrome extension that uses NLP to generate and ask helpful recall-based questions to reinforce key concepts for almost anything you read on the internet. \n\nPerhaps you're reading about the nuts and bolts of how transformers work in NLP, skimming documentation to remember the return value of a certain Javascript method, or following class notes from an art history lecture. But how much did you really take away from that article? And how much will you honestly remember a few hours or a day later?\n\nYou may take notes during a class or while reading a book, but we rarely have the time to take a step back and do this for the mountain of content that we learn online. We're excited to imagine how much more you could create if you could burn the content you cared about into your memory. We hope that Ferret can be the first step towards helping you get there.\n\nFerret is in alpha-release right now, which means that you'll encounter bugs and slower latency than we'd like. However, we welcome your contributions, and will actively review PRs and issues."
