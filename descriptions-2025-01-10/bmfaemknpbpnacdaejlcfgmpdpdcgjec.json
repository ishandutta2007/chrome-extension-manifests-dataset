Yes, I could have taken the time to write these words down, practice recalling them, and eventually mastered them, but to do so I felt inconvenient and low priority. My solution, was to create Spelling Coach. \n\nSpelling Coach lets you store a list of words you commonly misspell, and then gives you an interface to practice them. Because of the app being easily accessible in the browser, it is easy and convenient to add words as you misspell them. Then, during any moments of free-time or boredom, you can practice them all without leaving the page you are on.\n\nTrack your correct spellings through Spelling Coach's stats menu, and through enough repetition over time, words that you used to constantly misspell you will eventually master."
