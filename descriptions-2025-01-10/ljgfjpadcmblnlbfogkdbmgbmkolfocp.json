It's annoying on Google too, but there's already an extension to deal with that.\n\nThe simple fact is that Pinterest images pollute image search results. If you don't have a Pinterest account, then they are a walled garden, impossible to access and time-wasting. So, yes. It's yet another extension born out of deep-seated, existential rage!\n\nNotPinterested for Ecosia saves time by removing Pinterest content from Ecosia image search results.\n\nIt can be enabled or disabled via the browser icon."
