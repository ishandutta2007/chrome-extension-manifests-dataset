When?\n- why have I bookmarked it?\n- how did I get on it? Which page has led to it?\n- who sent me this link? Can I just jump to the message?\n- which links on this page have I already explored?\n- which posts from this blog page have I already read?\n\n*NOTE*: to get the most benefits from the extension, you also need to set up a supplementary service. You can find the instructions here: https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#setup"
