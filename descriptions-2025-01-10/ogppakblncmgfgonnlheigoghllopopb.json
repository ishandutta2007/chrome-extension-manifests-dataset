Closing that story it will take me back to my RSS reader.\n\n2. If I queue up a bunch of stories to read by middle-clicking several links, they will all open on the end of the tab list. When I go to read them by clicking on the first tab I opened, closing it will show me the next story.\n\nI recognize how incredibly small the audience is for this exact setup, but there you have it.\n\nAttributions\nI used to just locally comment out some code in Brad Dwyer's Modified Tab Ordering extension from https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lhlppppejjiiinhklmlpfkafimagbcbe - but Chrome now considers changes to be security issues.\n\nSince Brad's extension uses a deprecated version of the Chrome extension API, I based my version off of itworks' New Tabs At End from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tabs-at-end/bgogjfbkjgjhonhikkkflpkgpcpfljoa \n\nDouble Arrow glyph made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com licensed under CC BY 3.0"
