This way, when you decide to go to the next page of the comic, you don't have to wait for it.\n\nTo activate the extension (per tab):\n - open the webcomic you want to read\n - press the arrow symbol in the extension bar;\n   the arrow should turn yellow\n\nTo teach the extension how to find the next page, just click the link to the next page as normal. After a few seconds, the page should change, and the arrow should turn green. If the arrow doesn't turn green, the extension failed to identify the pattern for the \"next page\" link; if there are multiple links to the next page, try clicking a different one.\n\nTo go to the next page of a comic, either click the normal link to the next page or press enter.\n\nThis is an entirely personal project."
