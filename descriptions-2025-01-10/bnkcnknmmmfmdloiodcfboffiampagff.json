Just click HIPAANotes and create a Note.  HIPAA Compliance is built in.  When your EMR makes it difficult to get PHI (Personal Health Information) from here to there, your patients can’t wait for some new interface!  Send it with HIPAANotes today, securely.\n\nHIPAANotes is so much easier and more secure than Print and Fax.  No more lost faxes.  Did your HIPAANote disappear on the receiver’s fax machine?  It’s still there in your Sent Notes and in the receiver’s Received Notes—even when the receiver still prefers paper faxes.  It’s easy to resend to their fax number.  Or you can invite them to join you in the future. They will thank you for how much better—and more HIPAA Compliant—their life is in the PFE (Post Fax Era) with HIPAANotes.\n\nHIPAA Compliance is more than just encryption in transit and at rest—though that can be challenging enough.  It’s also about keeping records of who sees PHI.  When you need to communicate outside your EMR network with HIPAANotes, logging and accountability are automatic.\n\nYou know who you trust with your patients and their information.  HIPAANotes puts you in control of the secure transmission of all the Patient Information you need to share."
