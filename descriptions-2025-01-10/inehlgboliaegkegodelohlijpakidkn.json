Story points make it easier for teams to communicate how much work is being done, and consequently decide how large a team should be in order to complete that work.\n\nThis tool is to help with estimation when making story points.  It gives you the concept of how many hours are needed to get a certain number of features in a project and compares it against the amount of time it takes you to get there."
