This is done using stats for discipline, happiness and hunger. When discipline hits 0, your pet runs away!\n\nThe extension features many features for users to be productive including:\n\n- A todo list\n- A website blocker (in the options page). Websites will only be blocked during work time\n- Work / Break Timers that alternate and display a badge on the extension to show users whether it's time for a break or work\n\n\nTo take care of the pet, users can buy food from the shop using coins earned through completing todos as well as playing a minigame to keep the pet's happiness up. If happiness or hunger are at 0 the pet will start losing discipline so watch out!\n\nThis project is open source and can be contributed to at https://github.com/mccordnate/Productivity-Pet"
