The ticker will load the comments as they come in live and display them above or below the video stream.\n\nThis extension also includes the following user settings:\n- Comment Delay Time: allows you to set a customizable time delay to the comments so you can match the timing with your stream to avoid any spoilers\n- Display Location: allows you to set the ticker to display at the top or bottom of the video stream\n- Upvote Display Minimum: allows you to filter out displaying comments below a set number of upvotes\n- Font Size: allows you to set how large the ticker should be\n- Text Filter: allows you to suppress comments from displaying that contain any keywords that you enter\n\nVideo on how to use: https://youtu.be/61DNfg7ksRs\n\nView code: https://github.com/RG-O/LiveThreadTicker"
