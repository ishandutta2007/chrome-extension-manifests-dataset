For example, this may happen when the underlying network of your operating system changes, or a new IP route is added.\n\nTo make Chrome refresh its connection pools and reflect the changes applied to the operating system, you would usually need to perform these manual and often annoying steps:\n\n1. Open a new tab\n2. Type in the URL `chrome://net-internals/#sockets`\n3. Click `Close idle sockets` button\n4. Click `Flush socket pools` button\n\nThis extensions aim at completely automatising this process, so that every time your OS network stack changes, you can quickly refresh your Chrome browser too.\n\nNote: This extension needs to execute scripts in `chrome://net-internals/#sockets` webpage. Make sure you enable the `Extensions on chrome:// URLs` flag by:\n\n1. Open the URL `chrome://flags/#extensions-on-chrome-urls`\n2. Set the value to `Enabled`"
