This could be from another extension, a network level blocker, or something else. This extension reverts those tracking links back to the regular product link so that you can access the deal.\n\nI only recommend using this extension if you have no other workaround for getting the links on RFD to work. Affiliate links help out RFD and are generally unobtrusive. But if these affiliate links keep getting blocked for you and fixing it is out of your control, then this extension will save you the hassle of manually googling the deal. \n\nOne way to do this is by keeping the extension disabled while browsing and only enabling it when you come across a broken/blocked link. You can toggle between on/ off by clicking the extension icon (and then refreshing the page for it to take effect). In the options page, you can also whitelist certain sites so that the extension never modifies links from those sites.\n\nAlternatively, there is an option that inverts the whitelist so that only links from sites that are on the whitelist are modified (and all other links are left untouched). This is particularly useful if you know there is a certain site that is always broken for you, while leaving all other sites untouched."
