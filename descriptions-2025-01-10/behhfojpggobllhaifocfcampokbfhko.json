will format the JSON and add the ' quote padding automatically.\n* Capture a diagram of your process flow easily via the \"Capture Process Flow\" button; will capture the entire flow and save an image to a local file.\n  * Options available are - Use Transparent Background, Zoom Size and Ability to Expand all notes to capture the note detail\n* Debug has been enhanced to provide more robust coloring, this includes glowing colors, item selection and error emphasis.\n* Ability to Remove the Canvas Build Background (dots) which works well with dark modes.\n* Save Reminder – When packaging a component you will be reminded to save the process as Boomi doesn't save automatically when packaging.\n* Schedule Reminder - Once a deployment has occurred or been deployed to another environment the notification message will also provide a reminder to setup a schedule (if enabled).\n* Easily copy the current Component URL/ID using the Copy Component ID Button (In the ⚙️ action button above the build canvas).\n* Build Shape \"connector\" Pallet has been restored back to its better life before Boomi UX decided to change it and make it unusable.\n* Enable the selection of Icon Sets within the option to define user experience instead of default Boomi UX.\n* In Process Reporting, Pending Executions runtime clock/timer now auto-updates - Note: Auto Refresh must be turned on for this to work.\n* Define a custom refresh period and have process reporting auto refresh to your needs.\n* Expand the Element Selection Screen within Shapes to provide more visual room for ease of use.\n* Platform Status Detail - Shows if operational or if any Boomi systems are not operational.\n* Brand new code editor attached to Message, Notify and Command Shape, click Edit message to open up a dedicated code window with choice of code display\n* Tab names remove the account name to enable better display of tabs function i.e. Build, Reporting etc. Toggle Option Available.\n* New Icon against Drop Down Menu items i.e. Manage to allow you to click and open in new tab instead of the same window.\n* Default SQL Editor in Data Base Operation code area is now resizable for use with larger screens.\n* Connector Operation Screen for HTTP has increased sizing on Request details for better use.\n* Ability to Collapse All Processes into Folders in the Process Reporting Process Filter screen.\n* Ability to Collapse All Processes into Folders in the Deployed Process Screen in Atom Management.\n* Ability to remove the sticky revision notification from the build view.\n* Ability to adjust Schedule Section Icons in Atom Management to the old style prior to the new release due to new icons being hard to define based on a little color difference.\n* Ability to reverse the modal button layout to match side panel layout i.e. OK - Cancel instead of new default of Cancel - OK.\n* Ability to single-anywhere on a process folder or title to open (Instead of the tiny icon to expand).\n* Document viewer has been changed to Mono-Spaced to provide all round better display."
