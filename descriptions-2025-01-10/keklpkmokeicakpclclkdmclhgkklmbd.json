If the value is truncated then you can tell from the numbers and the '*' how long the string is e.g. `*3*5*7*9*12*15` is 14 characters long because the '*' after 15 is missing.\n\nCounterStrings are commonly used in  exploratory testing.\n\nThis extension is a simple CounterString generator, which:\n\n- displays a dialog asking for the number of characters,\n- then generates a CounterString of that length\n- the CounterString is logged to the dev console to allow copy and pasting,\n- the extension also inserts the CounterString into the value of the field that was selected when the right click context menu was displayed\n- this supports supports testing online forms.\n\nInstructions for use:\n\n- right click on and input field\n- enter value of CounterString\n- CounterString will be logged to the console (use dev tools to see it)\n- CounterString will be inserted as the value of the WebElement you clicked on\n\nNote:\n\n- works with forms on the actual page\n- this extension does not work with forms embedded in frames\n\nThis is open source and source can be found at GitHub:\n\n- https://github.com/eviltester/counterstringjs"
