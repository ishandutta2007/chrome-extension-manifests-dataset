The code is open source for maximum transparency.\n\nThe extension offers support for the following categories of private data:\n• Credit card numbers\n• Anglophone names\n• Email addresses\n• Phone numbers\n• US street addresses\n• US social security numbers\n• Secret keys\n\nYou can decide which ones you want to be protected against leaking by turning their respective detectors on or off after clicking on the extension icon.\n\nThe support for the mentioned categories is currently limited to English language.\n\nThe extension analyzes your input before you submit it to ChatGPT and warns you about the detected private data. Afterward you can decide if you still want to proceed or if you want to change your input accordingly.\n\nThe extension does not collect any kind of data.\n\nLakera is a fast-growing startup based in Zürich, Switzerland that is committed to solving AI safety, to foster innovation and benefit humanity.\n\nThe source code for the extension is published at : https://github.com/lakeraai/chrome-extension\nLearn more about Lakera and our products at: https://www.lakera.ai"
