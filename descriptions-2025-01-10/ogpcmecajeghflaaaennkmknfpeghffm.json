Keep track of your ideas while working on projects, manage open issues, or collaborate on pull requests. Organize important content with pins and streamline your workflow with a dashboard of recent activities. \n\nGreat for developers working across a lot of repos and organizations. \nAnd for companies and organizations that manage a lot of public open source projects and repos. Or, if you just want an easier way to track interesting repos.\n\nThe extension and server are open source:\n- Browser extension - https://github.com/siegerts/dossi-ext\n- Web app and API - https://github.com/siegerts/dossi-app\n\nTo begin, log in and click the Dossi button on any GitHub page after the extension is installed.\n\nüóíÔ∏è Private Notes: \nWith dossi, every GitHub page becomes a place to capture notes. Write, edit, and save your ideas privately, allowing you to revisit your insights later. Context-aware note taking redefines your GitHub experience.\n\nüíª Open Source:\nThe extension and app are open source. Feel free to inspect the code, make suggestions, or even host it yourself.\n\nü™Ñ Bring your own LLM API key (OpenAI compatible):\nUse your own API key (never leaves the browser) to create, save, and use your own prompts to use with GitHub Issue and Discussion content. \nYour settings are only stored in your browser and never sent to any servers except OpenAI when using a prompt. Save prompt output as new notes.\n\nüè∑Ô∏è Labels: \nCategorize with private labels. Classify your notes across projects and themes, making it easier than ever to revisit specific topics and organize your thought process.\n\nüìå Pins: \nFind an interesting discussion or a complex PR? Use pins to bookmark for quick access. Pinned pages let you keep a pulse on what‚Äôs important or relevant to you - and what to follow up on.\n\nüóÑÔ∏è Activity Dashboard: \nKeep track of content while navigating multiple GitHub pages. Find your way back to notes taken and manage all recent activity.\n\n---\n\n\nHave any questions? Don't hesitate to reach out @dossidev on https://x.com/dossidev."
