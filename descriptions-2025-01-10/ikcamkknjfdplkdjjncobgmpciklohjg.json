These include services like AccessiBe, EqualWeb, MaxAccess, and UserWay.\n\nWe know that while these overlays are supposed to make websites more accessible, they're actually annoying and often counter-productive. That's why we made AccessiByeBye, a simple browser extension that blocks these overlays.\n\nJust install AccessiByeBye into your browser, and those pesky overlays won't bother you again. There's no catch. We don't collect your web browsing habits or other personal information, and the AccessiByeBye extension won't slow down your browser or computer. If you ever decide you do want one of those overlays, it's easy to turn off the extension at any time.\n\nAt Pneuma Solutions, we're all in favor of any tools that truly improve accessibility. So if any of the accessibility overlays that we block actually become useful to the people that they claim to serve, then we'll remove those blocks. But until then, we believe that the spread of accessibility overlays is hindering true improvements in website accessibility. Read more about our thoughts on accessibility overlays."
