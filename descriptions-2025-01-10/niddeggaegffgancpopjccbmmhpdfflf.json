Feel free to create an issue in Github or contribute!\n\nChangelog:\n0.3.4 - Add support for subscriptions (via websocket link)\n0.3.3 - Bump manifest to v3\n0.3.2 - It is now possible to search and filter by variables (https://github.com/patresk/saturn/pull/8)\n0.3 - Filter and Clear functionality (https://github.com/patresk/saturn/issues/5, https://github.com/patresk/saturn/issues/3)\n0.2 - Dark mode support added\n\nhttps://github.com/patresk/saturn"
