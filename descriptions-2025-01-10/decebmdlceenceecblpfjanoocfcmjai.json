If something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, please open an issue on GitHub and give me a chance to help before leaving a review:\nhttps://github.com/sixcious/url-increment-button/issues\n\nAbout\nURL Increment Button is a simple 1-Click Button that can increment a URL for you. The button will try to increment the most likely number in the URL using its built-in algorithm (this is usually the last number). If it's not picking the right number you want, you can install and use \"URL Incrementer\" (separately available) to select the part of the URL you want to increment. The button will then increment the part you selected in URL Incrementer.\n\nFeatures\n• Increments the URL (finds a number in the URL and then increases it by 1)\n• A simple incrementer with no configuration or settings\n• Works with URL Incrementer (separately available) so you can use its settings to increment if needed\n• Requires no permissions\n• Uses no background memory when not in use\n\nPermissions Justification\nNo permissions are needed.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nURL Increment Button does not track you. It does not use analytic services. It does not collect any data from your device or computer. All your data is stored locally on your device. Your data is *your* data."
