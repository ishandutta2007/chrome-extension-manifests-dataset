Enjoy the silence!\n\nDo you ever find yourself scrolling through a bunch of tabs in search of that one video that's still playing? Simply press the Mute Everything button to pause it instantly.\n\n* This extension works by pausing all audio and video elements\n* Includes support for common music services (GrooveShark, Pandora, SoundCloud, and many more)\n* Works excellently with YouTube videos and HTML5 media\n* Plug-in objects can not be paused; they are inaccessible). Instead, such objects are temporarily removed, and can be individually restored with a single click.\n\nThis extension is far from perfect... please report any problems through the Feedback page. Please don't use reviews to report specific bugs, as I cannot respond to those."
