Great ideas can be communicated clearly and instantly, inspiring creative and collaborative minds. Effective meetings/classes have never been made so easy!\n \n➜ How MirrorOp Sender Works\n \nStep 1. Make sure that your display (big screen) is attached to an authorized receiver device (i.e. a wePresent base unit). \nStep 2. Install the MirrorOp Sender app on your Chromebook from which you want to share content.\nStep 3. Connect your Chromebook to the receiver device via WiFi. \nStep 4. All is set. You can now seamlessly share content to the display and engage with meeting participants via MirrorOp Sender.\n \n➜ Use Cases\n \nShare Ideas Wirelessly\nWith MirrorOp Sender, you can project any content from your Chromebook to the display handily and wirelessly. You can even stream your apps to the display! \n \nInspire Collaboration Effortlessly\nMirrorOp Sender enables multiple Chromebook users to share content to the same display simultaneously. Group activities can be easily facilitated, which in turn inspires collaboration.  \n \n➜ Product Features\n \nQuick Search\nOnce launched, MirrorOp Sender will automatically search for available receiver devices. You can also manually locate them by entering their IP addresses or hostnames.\n \nFavorite List\nYou can save the receiver devices you use most frequently as a Favorite List. The receiver devices stored in Favorites will always be placed on the top of the receiver list.\n \nDesktop Sharing\nA Chromebook user can instantly share his/her desktop to the display by simply clicking the Play button. The display will show everything that is on the Chromebook desktop.    \n \nApplication Sharing\nApplication Sharing makes it possible to share a specific application (rather than the whole Chromebook desktop) to the display. \n \nStudent Monitor\nA teacher can use a Chromebook to preview students’ device screens before they are projected to the display, and moderation can be done directly on the UI of MirrorOp Sender. (“Student Monitor” can only work if it is supported by the receiver device.)"
