To disable WhackAMole for a given site, click on the WhackAMole toolbar icon. When it finds content that looks like an ad, WhackAMole replaces it with an \"ad\" block. You can click on that to see the original content.\n\nWhackAMole never connects to a server and never inspects the data on the sites you visit. Instead, it looks for elements that look like ads and hides them using a set of builtin rules. If you disable WhackAMole for a given site, that site's URL is stored in the local browser history on your machine. Other than that, WhackAMole does not store any data, does not analyze your sites, and does not track your browsing behavior at all. \n\nHappy browsing!"
