Do you communicate in Meme or  GIF? Release yourself from the multiple clicks to fetch the image you want by using MyImgurEmoji. Use Imgur albums as custom emoji sets on any site--fetch image urls by :tag: as you're writing a message.\n\n1. Create an Imgur album and add any images you wish. https://imgur.com\n2. Add tag ids in the description of each image, such as :happy:\n3. Still on the Imgur album, click the MyImgurEmoji icon and click 'Add This Imgur Album'\n4. You're done! Type @mie :happy:@ in any textarea on any page, and the text will be replaced with the queried imgur image url.\n\nCurrent Limitations\n\nThis is a development version 0.1. It currently only works with html <textarea> elements, which are common on older-style message boards but less common on modern social media. Support for other message posting architectures will be released in later versions."
