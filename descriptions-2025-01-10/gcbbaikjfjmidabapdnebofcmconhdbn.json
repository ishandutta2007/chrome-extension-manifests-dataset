We are NOT affiliated with OmegleWeb whatsoever, nor is Chromegle a commercial product.\n\n[NOTICE]: Chromegle is currently undergoing a makeover to support sites like OmegleWeb, EmeraldChat, and OmeTV. Some functionalities may not work. Please keep up-to-date on progress in our Discord. https://discord.gg/McNUf5HV7F\n\nChromegle is open-source, and NEVER collects personally identifiable data. You can confirm this yourself by viewing the code for the extension which is publicly available here: https://github.com/ChromegleApp/Chromegle2\n\nChromegle can manage chats with its custom auto-skip, auto-typing and message filtering. It also introduces the first ever native dark mode support on the platform, allowing you to experience THREE website themes: Dark Mode, Light Mode, and Black Mode.\n\nIntegrated into the client is an IP scraper (and geolocator) that can tell you a user's country, state/province, and city. \n\nChromegle provides you with a custom paste-menu, profile notes, can take screenshots of the other user's video... and much more!\n\nTo get access to these features, just install the extension and hop on https://www.omegle.com. All configuration is opt-in!\n\nFeel free to contact us through the Discord link included on the home-page for inquiries into any issues or suggestions to improve the service."
