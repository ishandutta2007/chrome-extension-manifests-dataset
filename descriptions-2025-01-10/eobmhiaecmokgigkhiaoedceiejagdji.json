Once the interpretation is complete, we registered the videos in our extensions database, allowing anyone who uses the extension to toggle the interpretation with the click of a button. \n\n* How to Get It *\nInstall the extension into your Chrome browser. Once installed, all the interpreted content in our database will automatically appear and sync in your YouTube player! \n\n* Which Videos? * \nPiP Sync is only enabled for content that has been commissioned through our organization. If there are videos that you wish to have interpreted, refer them to us at pipsync.org and we can work together to get the video/s interpreted and registered in our database. As soon as the video is finished and linked to our extension, it will become available for all users."
