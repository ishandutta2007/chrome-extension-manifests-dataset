The extension works seamlessly with any YouTube video, regardless of the language of the captions. \n\nTo use the extension, you first need to get your OpenAI Key, which can be obtained from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys\n\nOnce you have your key, you can adjust the minutes of the video that you want to be checked for ads, thereby saving your OpenAI Key quota.\n\nYour OpenAI key is saved locally in your browser storage and is never shared with anyone, ensuring privacy and security.\n\nIt's important to note that the extension only works when the user clicks the \"Skip Promotion\" button, thereby conserving your OpenAI Key quota.\n\nThe extension is fully open-source, which means that you can contribute to its development by submitting your own Pull Requests to add new functionality or improvements."
