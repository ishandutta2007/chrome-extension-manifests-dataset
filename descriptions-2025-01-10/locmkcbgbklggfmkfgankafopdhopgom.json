That means that if you are in the US you will see the price of a download in USD, in england you will see the price in GBP and so on.\n\nCurrently it supports UK, US and Italian conversion, however anyone is welcome to add their own country by contributing to the project at https://github.com/barisbalic/msp-not-for-me or by informing me of the correct locale, and the value of a single MSP locally.\n\nFuture releases will also include nicer icons/images."
