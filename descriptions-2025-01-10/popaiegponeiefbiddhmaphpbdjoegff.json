No need to forget holidays, birthdays, or other events ever again! You can also easily keep track of days since previous events like starting a new job or moving into a new apartment.\n\nEvents can be re-ordered by a simple drag-and-drop feature and can be optionally set to automatically repeat weekly, biweekly, monthly, or yearly.\n\nThere are also a number of settings in order to customize your experience, such as changing the counter size, the color scheme of the page, filtering visible counters to only future or past counters, filtering counters based on date range (i.e. only showing counters that are a week away), and a privacy filter that blurs the counters on load and on inactivity so others cannot read them when you aren't there."
