Using these inputs it calculates the total, as well as the break down of refined, reclaimed, and scrap metals. To accomplish the break down of metals, the extension rounds to multiples of 11, where 11 would equal one scrap, 22 would equal two scrap, and 33 would then make a reclaimed. For example, given the total of 80.50, the extension would output: 80 refined, 1 reclaimed, and 2 scrap as it would interpret it as 80.55.\n\nThe extension also includes a \"Change Team\" checkbox where you can change the background color of the extension to RED or BLU team colors to fit your personal preferences."
