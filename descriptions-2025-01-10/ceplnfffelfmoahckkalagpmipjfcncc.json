(Search for an item, and then click the GREEN button that says 'Find Halloween Spells'.)\n- Adds multiple keys or refined metal on the steam trade offer page with a simple click (Also integrates with backpacks.tf's buy and sell order by automatically adding the 'values' of key/ref onto the input field)\n- \"HEAVILY REQUESTED FEATURE\": Outpost now displays backpack prices! (Currently on Beta, not all items works. Press the \"Get BP Prices Beta\" button to see Backpack prices on outpost)\n- On backpack.tf, you can select 'see inventory' in order to see them in the users' inventory. Useful to check if the item is still available (check if item is traded or not) or they can choose to inspect the item in-game.\n- On the steam profile page, rep.tf button is added on the profile page so the user can easily check the user's reputation.\n\nAnd more!\n\nSuggest a feature/report a bug under the support tab or visit my steam group.
