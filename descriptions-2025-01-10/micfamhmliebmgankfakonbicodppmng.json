Ask Ben (chat gpt) anything.\n\nAll you need to do is get an OpenAI API key and enter it in the box (this is stored locally only for you) then ask a question and wait for the response. You can then use the copy buttons to copy the response to your clipboard and clear button to clear the text area so you can ask a new question! It will also save your responses locally so you won't loose the last thing you have written. Have fun! \n\nBuy me a coffee if you like it!\n\nUPDATED 10/06/2023: Added new music button to play relaxing music while you chat gpt and work or study! \n*Added in ask for review."
