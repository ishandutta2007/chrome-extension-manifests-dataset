Custom conversion to most well-known formats (MP4, MPEG, 3GP, AAC, APNG, GIF) with custom input and output parameters like bit-rate and video size\n\nOperation modes:\n1. WASM mode (experimental): For conversions in this mode, there is no need for any permission. It uses the embedded FFmpeg for converting media files. \n2. Native mode: You will be asked to install a minimal native client. This native client works as a bridge to the well-known FFmpeg binary. Here you can see how to install the native client for different operation systems:\n1. Windows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18jAqTXBiZA\n2. Mac or Linux: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB4Bj_APg4g\nnote that the video tutorial is steps for the \"open-in\" extension.
