Button inserts the draft, or drafts, if there were multiple matches.\n\nThese early versions work only in the separate reply div, that you access by clicking the Answer icon under the tweet (or Retweet icon).\n\nSaving a draft happens in the same reply div (Editor Container). When you start writing a reply, Save Fast Reply button appears. When you are done writing the draft, you can select a key for the draft from the tweet you are replying to. If you don't, you will be prompted to enter the key upon clicking the Save Fast Reply button.\n\nYou can manage your saved drafts in the extensions popup.\n\nChanges in the version 0.1.1:\n\n* Draft can now include pictures.\n\n* If the draft database returns more than one match, you can now select one of them. You can do this when you hover mouse over the Fast Reply button. \nYou can also still insert all matching drafts by clicking the Fast Reply button.\n\nKnown bugs:\nWhen the draft contains more images than one, some of the images can get lost, because of the timing issues with the scripts that are part of Twitter UI. Select the draft again, and all the images should be inserted. Remove duplicate images."
