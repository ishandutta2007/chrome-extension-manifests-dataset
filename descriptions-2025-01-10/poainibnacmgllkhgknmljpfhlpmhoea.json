Who still has their Google Search from two weeks ago buried in the endless sea of tabs that you would \"Close when you're done\"? Do your friends constantly pick on you for being that type of person to always have what they deem \"too many tabs?\". If you answer yes to any of these, then this is the chrome extension for you.\n\nWith just a click of a button, 50% of your tabs will be closed at random, restoring balance to your browser. By terminating half of your tabs, there will be enough computer resources and RAM for the remaining half to run smoothly."
