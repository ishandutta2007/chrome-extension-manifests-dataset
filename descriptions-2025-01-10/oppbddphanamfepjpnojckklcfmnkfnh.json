In addition to focus manipulation, the Tilt-Shift effect is improved by increasing color saturation and contrast, to simulate the bright paint often found on scale models.\n\nMost faked Tilt-Shift photographs are taken from a high angle to further simulate the effect of looking down on a miniature. The technique is particularly effective on buildings, cars, trains and people."
