By participating in this experiment you contribute to research and make my masterâ€™s thesis possible! Research in this field has come a long way in terms of improving the design of the warnings to increase adherence rates. This thesis is about understanding users, to make it possible to create even better warnings in the future.\n\nHow it works: The extension detects when a warning is shown and asks you a few questions about your understanding of the warning and collects data, such as if you proceeded from the warning or not. Only after the first warning, it asks you additional more general questions, such as your age and nationality, and also about your knowledge in computer science."
