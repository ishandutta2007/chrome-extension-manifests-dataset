Select the required address and the form will immediately be populated with accurate information.\n\nADDRESS AUTO-COMPLETE\nAdds address auto-fill, lookup and validation to address forms for over 240 countries. Can be configured to allow the user to select which postal regions are required for delivery.\nThe checkout or form experience becomes faster and easier as a customer no longer has to type out their full address. The smart predictive search helps speed up form filling and boosts usability. Every address is verified at the point of entry. Problems due to incorrect or badly typed address data are drastically reduced.\nNote: Address Auto-Complete currently only provides functionality for Shopify, Shopify Plus and Salesforce.\n\nGETTING STARTED\nIn order to use this service, you will need to sign up for an account. You will then receive an access token which will give you access to our service. You need to insert this access token in the configuration options. We offer a 14-day free trial with 100 free searches for testing purposes, but in order to use this plugin on a live site, you must have a paid account with us.\nSign up here - https://fetchify.com"
