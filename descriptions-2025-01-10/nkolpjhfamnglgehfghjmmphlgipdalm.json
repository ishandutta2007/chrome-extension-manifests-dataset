The Chrome extension specifically helps with the task of adding parentheses and single quotes to query strings, which can be cumbersome and error-prone if done manually.\n\nHere's an explanation of what the QueCraft Chrome extension does:\n\nQueCraft Chrome extension, automates the conversion of text lines into a format that can be used as a query with the IN operator. The IN operator is commonly used in database queries to check if a value exists in a specified list. However, when using the IN operator, the query syntax requires the list of values to be enclosed within parentheses, and string values must be enclosed within single quotes.\n\nManually performing this conversion for multiple lines of text can be time-consuming and prone to mistakes. The Chrome extension alleviates this burden by taking the input text lines and automatically formatting them into the required query format. It adds the necessary parentheses around the list of values and inserts single quotes around string values, making them query-ready.\n\nBy using this QueCraft Chrome extension, users can save time and effort by avoiding the manual labor of formatting text into the proper query syntax. It ensures that queries are correctly structured and eliminates the possibility of syntax errors that may occur when doing the formatting manually.\n\nIn summary, you should install this QueCraft Chrome extension because it simplifies the process of converting text lines into a query-usable format by automatically adding parentheses and single quotes. It saves time, reduces errors, and ensures the accuracy and efficiency of the query-building process."
