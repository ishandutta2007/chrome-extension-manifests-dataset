This application helps users easily update data from their database to the platform and automatically trigger actions and perform auto-sync operations without the need for manual intervention.\n\nKey Features :\nAutomatic Data Sync (Auto Sync):\nThe extension can automatically synchronize data between the user's database and the platform. This ensures that the data in the platform is always updated and consistent with the user's database.\n\nAutomatic Action Triggering:\nCan automatically trigger actions within the platform based on pre-set configurations. Users can customize actions so the extension automatically performs them when certain conditions are met.\n\nIntegration:\nThe extension is tightly integrated with the platform. When users are working within the platform, the extension detects the relevant tab and triggers the necessary automation as needed.\n\nSettings Management and Storage:\nThe extension stores user settings, such as sync status and sync interval, allowing users to easily manage when and how automated tasks are executed.\n\nLimited Access Permissions:\nRequires only a few basic permissions, including access to browser tabs, storing settings, and executing scripts, but it does not collect or store any personal data from users.\n\nSimple User Interface:\nThe extension features an intuitive interface that allows users to configure and customize settings easily without requiring programming knowledge.\n\nHow It Works:\nAutomatic Detection: The extension checks the user's browser tabs and only activates when the tab is related to the platform.\nAuto Sync: Once configured, the extension will sync data at intervals set by the user.\nAction Triggering: The extension can automatically trigger actions based on the user's needs (e.g., data sync, performing specific tasks in the platform).\nThis application is ideal for:\nDevelopers or users working with platforms who need a tool to automate synchronization and action tasks.\nUsers who want to increase productivity and save time by minimizing manual actions when working with their platform.\nIn Summary:\nAdd-ons is a useful tool for those who work frequently with the platform and want to automate data synchronization and action triggering without manual intervention, making workflows more efficient and faster."
