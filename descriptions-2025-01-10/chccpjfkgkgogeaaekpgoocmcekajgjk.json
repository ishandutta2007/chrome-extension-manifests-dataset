Text-Based Content: articles, blog posts, and written material that show signs of being automatically generated without meaningful human input.\n2. Video Content: soulless or generic videos (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, TikTok) where narration, visuals, or scripts are entirely AI-produced.\n3. Spammy or Low-Value Pages: websites using AI to generate content solely for clicks, ads, or SEO manipulation, offering little to no real value to users.\n\n💡 What Does Is Generated Do for You?\n----------------------------\n1. Blocks websites that were reported as AI-generated.\n2. Notifies you about pages suspected to be AI-generated.\n\n💪 What Can You Do with Is Generated?\n----------------------------\n1. Report Pages: if you believe a page contains AI-generated content, report it via the extension popup.\n2. Confirm or Dismiss Suspicious Pages: help validate community reports by agreeing with or disputing them.\n3. Instantly Block Reported Pages: directly block any pages you think are AI-generated.\n\n⬜ Is Generated adheres to Chrome's minimum permissions policy and requests only the following:\n----------------------------\n1. \"storage\": stores your settings and randomly generated 16 character client ID locally in your browser.\n2. \"tabs\": retrieves the current page URL to match with server records in order to determine if it has been reported.\n\n🔒 Privacy Guaranteed\n----------------------------\nIs Generated does not display ads, and it does not read, collect, or share your data. We only save your reported page URL.\n\n💌 Support the Extension\n----------------------------\nIs Generated is completely FREE. You can support the extension by joining the community and helping to shape the future of this project or by donating to improve the development process."
