And I'm lazy to close them all one by one.\n\nUsually, I need keep them opened until I found exact page I needed. But after that I don't even return to Google results and these tabs stay opened until I remember that.\nMoreover, I start typing new search query on last opened tab even when previous tab was a Google tab.\n\nYou can also try https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/close-all-tabs/jcokdfogijmigonkhckmhldgofjmfdak?hl=en - btw, good extension!\n\nBut I prefer to see the logo of the page I want to close and I just wrote it - I know what actually it does.\n\nBonus: This extension supports suspended pages by following extension: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-great-suspender-notra/ahkbmjhfoplmfkpncgoedjgkajkehcgo"
