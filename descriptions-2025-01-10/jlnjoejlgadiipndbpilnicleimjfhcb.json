Gblock provides you with full protection against email tracking, shielding you from spy pixels, tracking links, and anonymizing you via our proxy.\n\n✔️ SPY PIXEL PROTECTION\n\nSpy pixel tracking is a sneaky technique based on adding an invisible 1x1 image, known as a \"tracking pixel,\" to an email. When you open the email, this pixel sends information back to the sender, revealing details like when you opened it, where you were, and what device you used. All of this is done without your knowledge or consent, making it a serious privacy concern. Gblock detects and blocks tracking pixels, providing complete protection against spy pixel tracking.\n\n✔️ TRACKING LINK PROTECTION\n\nLink tracking involves adding custom tracking parameters to URLs, such as \"?utm_source=newsletter\", or embedding unique tracking codes. Some email marketing tools take this a step further by using URL shorteners to obscure the final destination, making it impossible to remove tracking parameters. Similar to spy pixels, tracking links can expose your location, device details, and other personal information.\nGblock protects you from tracking links in two ways: Stripping all known tracking parameters from URLs, and using our proxy server to follow email links, masking your IP address and fully anonymizing your activity. Our proxy also caches responses, so if a tracking link is shared among multiple users, we already know the final destination and can serve it directly without accessing the tracking link. We are confident this would cover you for 99% of the cases.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n30 DAYS FREE TRIAL, NO CREDIT CARD REQUIRED\n\nGblock comes with a 30-day trial, after which a paid subscription is required. See our pricing page: https://www.gblock.app/pricing.\n\n_________________________________________________________\nIS IT SAFE?\n\nYou should always be careful about which extensions or apps you use with your email.\n\n✔️ The code for Gblock is entirely stored on your computer (no remote code) and is for the sole purpose of enhancing Gmail's privacy and security.\n✖️ Gblock does NOT request access to your email.\n✖️ None of your personal data is collected, stored, or sent to Gblock.\n✖️ Gblock does not track any of your activity.\n✖️ Gblock have no ads.\n_________________________________________________________\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nYou can find Gblock Privacy Policy here: https://www.gblock.app/privacy\n_________________________________________________________\nANY QUESTIONS?\n\nDrop us a line at: https://www.gblock.app/support"
