It can:\n\n- See the JSON representation of the current Integrator.io page/object. Copy it to your vcs or compare it with another flow. Check field ids or URLs that are not directly visible.\n- Directly edit the JSON object and save it back to Celigo using a PUT operation.\n- Copy the JSON of the object to the clipboard for use in a My API or script.\n- Clone any Celigo object. This action created a so-called 'shallow' clone, eg if you clone a flow the underlying imports/exports/script are re-used and not cloned themselves\n- List errors in a flow, export or import.\n- Run a ping command on a Celigo connection to check if the connection is working.\n- Start a delta-flow by manually typing in the date to be used.\n- Show orphaned exports/imports, that are not used by any part of integration/flows.\n- Copy custom setting templates to easily make custom settings\n\nUsage\nWhen on a Celigo page, click on the icon on the menu bar to open the extension. The extension works on both US and EU domains, and reuses your Celigo session details as credentials. All requests go directly and only to integrator.io, no data is saved or used by ZangaBee or others.\n\nWho are we? \nZangaBee is an integration specialist with customers in EU and North America. We build our integrations using Celigo Integrator.io platform. ZangaBee prides itself in good functional discussions with customers to come to intelligent integration solutions.

Send your suggestions to coding@zangabee.com!\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.4\nSaves viewmode\nAdds support for logging in with owner account.\nAdds support for Integration App pages.\nFixes url parameters being incorrectly split from page url.\nV0.5\nSupport extra urls: response mappings & transformations, IA and templates\nV0.6\nAdded Nuri Ensings excellent Resolve All Errors function. Open the extension on the open errors list to use.\nV0.7\nSmall fix in parsing legacy IA urls"
