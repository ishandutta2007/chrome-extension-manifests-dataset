The result will be displayed in the action text box, which you can then use to guide your decision.It will display aggressive action exactly 50% of the time and passive action exactly 50% of the time.\n\nThis tool can also be use as random number generator. You can click on the \"RNG\" button if you need to generate a random number between 0 and 100. You can also auto-generate a random number every 5 seconds with the \"Auto Generate\" button.\n\nThe extension can be detached from the browser and used as a standalone window, which you can place anywhere on your desktop for added convenience."
