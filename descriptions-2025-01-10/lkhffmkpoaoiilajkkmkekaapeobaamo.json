Mostly the same.\n\n8/6/23: back from vacation. Updated the tool to allow stock removal. Sorry for the delay.\n\n6/19/2023: Got help with finding a new free stock fetching API. Thanks to Peter!  I added a lightmode and darkmode for y'all!\n\nI have seen a lot of extensions for looking at the stock market that just don't work. Some work but are too complicated and do too much for a casual user.  This is my solution to that.\nArtwork: Caity: www.imcaity.com\nAPI: FinnHubb.io\n\n\n6/14/2023: Unfortunately the API I use for retrieving stock data has moved to a paid service.  I'm not gonna show you guys ads and I am not gonna pay out of my pocket for it so.... I think we're toast. It's been a fun couple of years. Thanks for using the toolbar.\n\n1/30/22: Updated the list which retrieves the stocks. Now implementing NASDAQ & NYSE. You may now search by stock symbol.\n\n2/26/20: The API we're using is erroring out, currently working on it. Sorry for the delay.\n\n10/1/19: updated stock fetching so you can add stocks again!\n\n6/17/19: API bit the dust. I found a way around it, but it looks like free options are going away.... any angel investors? :)\n\n1/24/2019: Added sorting and a new color scheme. \n\n1/17/2019: After Robinhood API betrayed us and stopped allowing public use of their API... we had to find a new one! IEXtrading swooped in and saved us. Coming soon is being able to reorder the stocks. Hey how about I throw in charts too? Everyone loves a good pie... chart."
