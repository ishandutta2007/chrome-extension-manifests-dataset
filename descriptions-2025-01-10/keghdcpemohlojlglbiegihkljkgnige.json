This browser extension tells you which links inside Gmail are safe, dangerous and unknown. If a link is “unknown”, you should proceed with caution. The URL reputation system built into the software tells you when sign in pages and websites are verified as safe.\n\nMetaCert is the only software that can protect you from *new* dangerous links and websites that evade other security companies that haven’t had time to validate them yet.\n\nMillions of new domains are registered by cybercriminals every year. It’s mathematically impossible for any security company in the world to protect you from them all. That’s why we decided to do things different at MetaCert. \n\n1 minute to install / no setup. \n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n- Red Warning = Danger\n- Green Shield = Verified\n- Grey Shield = Caution\n\nWhenever you open a link, this extension will immediately check it against the MetaCert authentication system. Dangerous links/websites are immediately blocked before harm can be done. And authenticated websites display the MetaCert green shield.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nBefore signing into Microsoft365, the reputation shield will turn green. If the shield doesn’t turn green, you know it’s a new counterfeit website that hasn’t been validated yet. This is the magic that will keep you safe.\n\nWHY WEBSITE AUTHENTICATION?\n\nOver 93% of all new phishing websites start with https and display the browser padlock. It’s time to replace the padlock with the reputation shield for online trust.\n\nFREE TRIAL\n\nYou can try the software for free for 7 days. No credit card needed. And if you sign up, you can cancel your subscription at anytime. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee.\n\nMost security products that are free, collect and sell your data. The biggest security extension on this store was banned from the Chrome and Firefox store for selling user data. We think that’s creepy. That’s why ours is a paid service. Pricing here: https://metacert.com/select-plan.html\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nMetaCert is brought to you by the same developers who built the official browser extensions for digg, Delicious, Yahoo!, Nike, Sony, eBay, PayPal, Google and Microsoft. We build software that’s fast, secure and reliable.\n\nFounder and CEO Paul Walsh is one of the two people who co-instigated the creation of the standard for URL Classification at the W3C, the standard body for the World Wide Web - formally replacing PICS in 2009."
