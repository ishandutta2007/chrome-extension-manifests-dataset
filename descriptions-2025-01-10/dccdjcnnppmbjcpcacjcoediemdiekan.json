Compassion-O-Matic replaces \"migrant\" with \"refugee\" across the web. You might be surprised by how differently the news reads - try it, and see for yourself.\n\nWHY WAS THIS MADE?\nThis extension was written during the 2015 crisis in Europe, during which time the BBC (and others) adopted an editorial policy of using the term \"migrant\" despite \"refugee\" being a more relevant description in most cases.\n\nThe words we choose to use are important. They colour our interpretation of events, and our attitude towards people, whether we notice or not. See for example https://www.ft.com/content/3adb9a6f-bf99-3f6f-b891-e2d7e6ea07d9 and https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/8/20/why-al-jazeera-will-not-say-mediterranean-migrants.\n\nWHY DOES IT NEED THOSE PERMISSIONS?\nThis extension has to read the pages you open in order to replace words on them. No data is ever transmitted. The full source code is available at https://github.com/pdavies/compassion-o-matic."
