You are dealing with a real human being here.\n‚Äì\nI think we can all agree that Discord is a suboptimal place for working with Midjourney. And the endless copying and pasting makes the already cumbersome constraints of the platform only worse. The Promptalot Helper extension aims to eliminate most of these problems and supercharges your prompting experience.\n\nWhether you want to copy an entire prompt or only a specific part of it, or perhaps you want to download an image, Promptalot makes it a breeze and will save you thousands of unnecessary clicks. It also allows you to manage your prompts on the Promptalot platform where you can collect and curate your very best prompts.\n\nSo what happens once Midjourney moves to its new web interface? Don't worry, Promptalot will be there to help you solve all of those tiny little inefficiencies which even the most polished web UI is guaranteed to produce. If it's annoying, Promptalot will eventually fix it.\n\nüëã Do you use the Discord Desktop/Mobile App? ‚ùì\nThis is a browser extension. Emphasis on \"browser\". So this will only work if you actually use the browser-version of Discord. There is absolutely no way for a Chrome extension to impact anything outside the browser. It's just not possible.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Permission Requirements ‚ö†Ô∏è\nIn order to work and help you get the most out of your prompting experience, the Promptalot Helper extension needs access to pages hosted on discord.com, midjourney.com and promptalot.com. Without these permissions, it is impossible for the extension to attach itself to the UI. No data is collected by the extension. It only helps you do things directly on the page and, if you have a Promptalot account, manage your prompts directly from Midjourney.\n\nüÜï What's New üÜï\n‚Ä¢ [v0.0.56, 2024-09-23]: Fixed the toolbar in the Web UI again.\n‚Ä¢ [v0.0.55, 2024-09-05]: Fixed the toolbar in the Web UI.\n‚Ä¢ [v0.0.54, 2024-06-23]: Another tiny UI fix on the alpha website.\n‚Ä¢ [v0.0.53, 2024-06-19]: Small UI Fix.
