You will be prompted for password and the default \"binary file\" view will be replaced with decrypted content (assuming it's text). You will be able to switch back and forth between original view and decrypted content.\nIMPORTANT: it's not compatible to work on the latest version of bitbucket (with new atlassian UI).\nIMPORTANT: It kind of heuristically detects bitbucket (aka stash) websites based on either subdomain or first path segment. So if domain name for your bitbucket server doesn't match with neither of those, then it won't work."
