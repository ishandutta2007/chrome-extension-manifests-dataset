This extension analyzes meta tags, HTTP headers, and robots.txt files to detect common directives that may affect indexability.\n\nWith real-time analysis, Indexability Checker shows the page status through an icon in the toolbar, which updates based on indexability results. Detailed results are provided to help users understand if any “noindex” or restrictive settings are present.\n\nThe extension also offers customizable notifications, alerting users when a page is detected as non-indexable. All checks are performed locally on the user’s device, ensuring privacy with no data collected or shared externally. Indexability Checker is ideal for anyone managing live websites or content to ensure pages are properly configured for search engine visibility."
