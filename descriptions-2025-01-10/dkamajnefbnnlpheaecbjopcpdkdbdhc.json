To do this you need to find the cdn-link where the mp3 is hosted, and fetch that in your Strudel patch. This software was made within a research project at Chalmers University of Technology in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden, to teach programming to kids.\n\nThis add-on might have other use-cases that the developer has not thought of."
