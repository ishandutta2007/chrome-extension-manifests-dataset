At that point, you know you have been distracted from your initial goal.\n\nThis chrome extension will help you browsing more responsibly.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1 ) Set task for today\nSetting tasks helps you to focus your efforts, allow you to measure your progress, and give you the motivation to strive forward. \n\n2 ) Avoid distracting websites\nWhen you visit distracting websites, we will remind you of your undone tasks so you can rethink your action. \n\n3 ) Consequences reminder\nWhen you choose to \"snooze\" our close tab reminder, we will tell you how much time you might waste by doing so\n\n3 ) Task tracker\nBy tracking how much it takes for you to complete a task, you can measure how productive you are. Maybe you can do it better, right?\n\nThis extension is unforceful by design, it won't suddenly close your tabs or block the access to the distracting websites, it's all on you. But it will remind you what's good for you to get things done.\n\nThis extension is configurable, you can tailor your own distracting websites list, though by default we have listed 85 websites that we consider distracting/time-wasting. \n\nAlso, this extension is under active development if you have a feature suggestion, problem, found a bug or question please let me know by sending an email to irfangumelar@gmail.com.\n\nWHAT'S NEW :\n\nV. 0.5.0:\n- Released with public visibility\n- Added Consequences Reminder feature\n\nV 0.4.2 :\n- Initial release with unlisted visibility"
