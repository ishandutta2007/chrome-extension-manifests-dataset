Please note that, only few tweaks are selected by default. There are few settings (related to JavaScript, inline-script and cookie) available in toolbar popup to adjust.\n\nCurrently there are 8 tweaks available for this add-on:\n1. Block most common ads.\n2. Block third-party JavaScript.\n3. Enable safe-browsing.\n4. Block cookies.\n5. Block inline-script.\n6. Block Flash contents.\n7. Disable window.eval().\n8. Block most common malware URLs.\n\nNote 1: I have made this extension with Yubi's collaboration. This add-on is inspired by Speed Tweaks made by Yubi: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speed-tweaks/afebilemcaepdkmhmibgmnpfppnjimjf\n\nNote 2: to report bugs, please fill the bug report form in the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/security-tweaks.html)."
