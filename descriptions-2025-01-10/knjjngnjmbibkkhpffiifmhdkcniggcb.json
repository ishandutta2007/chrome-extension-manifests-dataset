Just click on the eBay listing you want to list or save to your catalogue. When the extension sees that you are viewing an eBay listing's page, the logo in the address bar will change color from grey to green. When the logo is green, you can click it and select what you want to do with the listing - you can either select 'Create listing' or 'Create product'. When you select an option, a listing form or product creation form will appear on Shopiago with all the available listing information already pre-loaded to their respective fields (categories, attributes etc.).\n\n*a registered Shopiago Account is required to use the extension!"
