The code for the snake was created by Code Bullet, all credit for making that the Snake Game code goes to him. I sourced the code from the his website (TheBigCB.com), and turned the wonderful homepage visual into an little extension that can just be watched and enjoyed.\n\nNotes:\n1) If you want to slow it down, press the down arrow. To speed it back up, just press the Up arrow.\n\n\nBug Fix:\n1) The game field has been extended to cover up the white border on the right side of the window.\n\n2) The whole extension window is now utilized for the snake game's play field on the first run."
