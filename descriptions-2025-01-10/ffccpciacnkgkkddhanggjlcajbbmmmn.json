This enables centralized management of digital assets, providing users with both convenience and complete control.\n\n2) CNTP Token Transfers:\n\nWith the Wallet-Mining extension, users can easily send CNTP tokens to other wallets. This feature ensures fast and secure transactions, simplifying the management and distribution of assets within the CNTP network.\n\n3) Continuous CNTP Mining:\n\nThe extension offers continuous CNTP mining, even when the extension is closed. This ensures that users can maximize their mining potential without needing to keep the extension actively open, providing a consistent stream of rewards."
