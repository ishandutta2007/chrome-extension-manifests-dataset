However, this means that when you go to the edit activity on Strava (to rename your activity or change the privacy of the activity), there is no Golf option. As a result, suddenly, your golf activity changes from golf to your last activity type, such as walk.\n\nThis extension auto injects a Golf activity into the dropdown list of activity types on the Strava activity edit page. Suppose the activity that you are currently editing is already a golf activity. In that case, the extension will select the Golf activity for you."
