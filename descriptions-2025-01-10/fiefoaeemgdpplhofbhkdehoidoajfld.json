It works by automatically selecting the divs by their XPATH and injecting a new class, one which we can control with simple CSS. The actual hiding is done by sending the respective divs to -99999px.\n\n---------------------\n\nVersion 2:\n\nSeems like they updated the site and the names of the divs and classes are not random anymore. Because of this the extension itself is a bit redundant as I think uBlock Origin will probably be working now.\n\nIcons: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/no-entry_1661919 and https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/ads_983841\n\nAlso sorry for forgetting about this for 3 years. Came back to me as an offer to buy the extension. As I hate solo devs selling their code to companies that monetise it, I didn't, to try to set an example (you hear me quickpik dev??). Plus the code itself is so simple it wouldn't have been wort much either way.\n\nSo uh, changelog\n\n* updated to adapt to the new code running on lightshot\n* also applies to their homepage\n* added fancy new icon\n* version number changed from 1.1 to 2.0\n\nNo tracking no anything, just rewriting some CSS."
