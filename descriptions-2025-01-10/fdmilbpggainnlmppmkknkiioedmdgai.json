We would rely on the community (Crowd Participation) to validate whether the collected data is relevant or not. If the step is filtered at the start, then it would save crucial time during or after a crisis.\n\nCrowd4EMS chrome extension will enable the end users to send in relevant information pertaining to a particular disaster, especially during the initial hours and the volunteers can add these information as and when they come across. This would save a lot of time and manual effort in the later stage."
