Once you install the Lite Node, it runs in the background of your computer and uses small amounts of unused internet bandwidth to view AI training data on the web. It can’t see any of your personal information or usage, it just takes data from public websites and sells it to AI companies.  And you get rewarded for helping!\n\nSpark is fully compliant with all cybersecurity testing standards through continuous monitoring by AppEsteem, the world’s leading provider of cybersecurity certification. Additionally, Spark is a core contributor to the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO), which develops the standards for cybersecurity and anti-malware solutions.\n\nSpark only uses a tiny fraction of unused bandwidth, so you’ll never experience any reduction in the speed or quality of your own internet activity.
