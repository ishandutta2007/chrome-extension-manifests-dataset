A fast-paced, challenging variation of the classic Snake game. In this version, players control a snake that moves across the screen, trying to eat apples while avoiding collisions with itself and the edges of the game area. As the snake consumes apples, it grows in length, making it increasingly difficult to maneuver without crashing. The game's speed is faster than the original, requiring quick reflexes and strategic thinking to achieve high scores.\n\nControls:\n\nUse the arrow keys or W (up), A (left), S (down), and D (right) keys to change the snake's direction.\nPlayers can press any moving key when the snake is dead to restart the game."
