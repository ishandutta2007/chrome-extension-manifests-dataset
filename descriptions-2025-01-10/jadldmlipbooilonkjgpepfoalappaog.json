But before sharing, I like to annotate them, crop a little bit, add some color, and then share. I'm not particularly eager to embed images in Excel sheets, Documents, or Emails; I always prefer to share a link.\nNot only that, sometimes I want to see the history of all images I already shared, or blur faces, or highlight a specific part of the pages. Using arrows, circles, and rectangles. That's why I the Control V tool.\nToday the storage cost is so low that I promise never to delete your images. \n\nI hope you will enjoy using the tool, at least like I enjoyed to create it.\n\n[privacy policy]\nThey extension doesn't collects any kind of information. It's just open the online tool. The online tool uses Google Analytics and save the screenshot and your email.\n\nMore info: https://ctrl.vi/privacy"
