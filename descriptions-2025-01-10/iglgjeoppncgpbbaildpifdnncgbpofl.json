Share the link with your friends for synced Netflix videos.\n\nNo ads, no queues, no login, and no lag.\nCompletely secure, free, and open source.\n\nWe avoid lag and capacity issues since our solution doesn't provide text or video chat - we recommend using another app to do this since there's a good chance you're doing so anyway.\n\nFor best results, make sure you and everyone else in the party has the time and time zone on their computer set as accurately as possible. The best way to do this is to go to settings and allow your computer to set it automatically.\n\n\nLink to source code: github.com/debkbanerji/netflix-sync-party\nMade with ❤️ by Deb and Mihir\n\n\nFAQ\n\n# Do you support chat?\n\nThe extension doesn't support video or text chat, since external services almost certainly do that better, and you'll probably have a chat that you use to plan your party anyway.\n\n# Do you support syncing across multiple episodes?\n\nWe currently don't support syncing across multiple episodes, but you can easily generate a new link once the new episode starts.\n\n# Do you support synced seeking?\n\nWe don't support synced seeking in order to avoid security issues such as those that crop up with similar extensions (third parties hijacking your stream). If there is enough demand, we can implement a workaround in the future to choose the point in the video to start at. In the meantime, we recommend you look at other solutions. \n\n# Why did you make this?\n\nWe made this for our friends, since other solutions were kind of unreliable when we tried them, and they wanted something simple and stable that could sync our movies during a call."
