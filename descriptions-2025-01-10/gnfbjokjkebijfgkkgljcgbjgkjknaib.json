Currently when you are chatting to a user through livechat you can see what they are typing before they have sent the message. Some agents don't want to see this text as it may contain sensitive information that the user doesn't want the agent to see/have changed their mind about sending. With this extension installed the 'sneak peek' text is hidden from the agent so they can't see what a user has typed until they have pressed send."
