This extension is made to be simple, install it and start giving super powers to your boards.\n\nAdd SP to a card by typing the number in parenthesis:\n\"(3) Design new homepage header\"\n\nTrack time spent on each card:\n\"(1/3) Design new homepage header\"\n\nAssign a card to a Project by writing it in square brackets:\n\"[dev] Implement Ads in footer\"\n\nCreate a Header Separator by creating a new card with three asterisks at the start and end:\n\"*** Sprint 3 ***\"\n\nYou can add as many tags as needed. Tags will be colored automatically in a random color.\n\nBoth SP and Tags can be defined anywhere in the card's text, it's usually best to add them at the start so it's easier to read.\n\nAt the top right of the Lists and Cards you can see how many story points have been completed and how many there are in total.\n\nCompatibility\n―――――――――――――――――――\nIf a team member doesn't have the extension installed he will still see be able to see Story Points and Projects as well as modify them (he won't see colors or progress bars). You can install/uninstall the extension at any time without loosing any data too.\n\nThis extension is the fastest and with the best performance of all similar extensions and at simply 2KB of code, a seamless extension to have installed, even for slow computers or for those users who want Chrome to work fast and are concerned on having too many extensions, this extension has such a tiny footprint that goes unnoticeable."
