The plugin now works again.\n- Version 1.0.10 (2025-01-05): Added postcode lookup for listings with no sale history.\n- Version 1.0.9 (2025-01-04): The extension is now 2x faster and offers copy-to-clipboard functionality.\n- Version 1.0.7 (2024-11-26): Updated the plugin to reflect new changes to Rightmove. The plugin now works again.\n- Version 1.0.5 (2024-11-01): Fixed a problem where addresses have not been rendered correctly.\n- Version 1.0.0 (2024-07-14): Initial release.\n\n== How to use ==\nInstall the extension, and addresses will appear in the listings automatically.\n\n== How it works ==\nOur plugin uses historical sale data to find accurate addresses. You'll find the complete address directly on listing pages and individual property pages, for both sale and rental, saving you time and effort. \n\nClicking on the address will open Google Maps, pinpointing the exact location. You can also copy the address to your clipboard by clicking the copy button.\n\nIf a property hasn't been sold, the address may not be found. In such scenario, only the postcode will be presented. Clicking the postcode will open Google Maps, showing the exact postcode area boundary. From there, you can quickly locate the property manually with the help of satellite or street view.\n\n== Contact ==\nHave any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi? Shoot me an email at bart65692@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you!"
