Remember when search was easy, clean and de-cluttered? Remember when you could search for a restaurant's phone number and not be bombarded by disgruntled eaters' grievances? Remember when you could search for a movie's screening times and not be derailed by a rotten rotten tomatoes review that sends you down a worm hole of search, looking for an alternative? Review blocker aims to take you back to pre-IPO google search, where user aggregated reviews didn't clutter your web experience."
