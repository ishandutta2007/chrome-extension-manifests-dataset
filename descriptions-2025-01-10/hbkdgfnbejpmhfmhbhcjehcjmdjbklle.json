In such cases you have to be stayed in meeting room throughout and have to close meeting when it ends, otherwise you will be the only person remaining and other team members will have an impression that you were not listening to the discussion. \n\nTo avoid such situations you can use this plugin to end meet sessions automatically even if you are not near the system. Please ensure the tab is active when you are away ;)."
