It's missing a lot of keyboard shortcuts, seeking tracks is not precise and does not support picture in picture, which most browsers support.\n\nThis extension replaces the default player with a video.js player. (https://videojs.com)\n\nVideo.js is an extensible video player for browsers, has a lot of plugins, and is used by a lot of companies in production. Watch and Learn leverages it to offer the following features:\n\n- binge mode (or \"Learn and Chill\")\n- playback rates up to 3x on all videos and audios\n- default video playback rate using settings in the popup\n- picture in picture support\n- keyboard shortcuts like 'M' to mute, 'Space' to pause/play, 'F' to fullscreen, and many more using the 'videojs-hotkeys' plugin"
