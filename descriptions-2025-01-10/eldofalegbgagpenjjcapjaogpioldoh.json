You don't have to take our word for it, the source code is unobfuscated and available to be inspected.\n\nWe are committed to the privacy of our users. Omni and Tefter don't show any ads, they don't track you and don't display annoying notifications.\n\nOmni is free, but perfectly paired with Tefter.io, the social bookmarking toolkit for teams. You can connect Omni to your Tefter account to sync your bookmarks to the cloud and access them from all your devices.\n\nOmni is primarily intended to be used through a keyboard-driven user interface.\n\nOpen Omni:\n\nSurface Omni by hitting alt+k. Now you can search your history, tabs and Tefter.io bookmarks. The search scope is configurable.\n\nGroups:\n\nAll your links are automatically organized into groups based on some parameters of link like the domain name. For example corp1.slack.com and corp2.slack.com would belong to the same group named Slack. Only the top ten most frequently accessed groups appear.\nYou can switch between groups by pressing TAB.\n\nOrganizations:\n\nCollaborate with others and build a common knowledge base of your most useful bookmarks and aliases. Access the organization's bookmarks from any page or even through our Slack integration. This feature requires a Tefter.io account.\n\nAliases:\n\nYou can create shortcuts to links you commonly use. We call such shortcuts aliases. To use aliases you need a Tefter account. To create an alias, read here. To search and navigate to aliases, either hit alt + a or type /go in the Omni search bar. You may also navigate to an alias, let's say docs by typing go/docs in your browser's address bar. This feature requires a Tefter.io account.\n\nBookmarks:\n \nOmni will make your existing bookmarks searchable.\nTo add a bookmark through Omni, hit alt+b or press on the press the extension icon  followed by the \"add bookmark\" option.\n\nHotkeys:\nIn settings you can see and configure keyboard shortcuts for most common actions.\n\nShortcuts:\nalt + b Bookmark current page\nalt + k Show Omni search\nalt + a Show aliases\narrow down Select the next link in results\nctrl + j Select the next link in results\narrow up Select the previous link in results\nctrl + k Select the previous link in results\ntab Select the next group\nshift + tab Select the previous group\nctrl + l Select the next organization\nctrl + h Select the previous organization\nalt + number Select the organization by number, where number in [1, 5]\nalt + 0 Deselect any organization\n\nOn MacOS, use option ‚å• instead of alt.\n\nCommands:\n/s <query> Lookup <query> via external search\n/c <alias> Create an alias\n/go <alias> List aliases and navigate to the selected one\n/t <query> List open tabs and navigate to selected one"
