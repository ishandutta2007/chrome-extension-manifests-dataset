This extension was initially made just for me but I decided to release a public build for everyone to download. More features might get added in the future!\n\nCurrent list of features:\n\n- Total downloads counter on model and profile pages\n- Dynamic progress bar on profile pages indicating progress to next reward\n- View item statistics button that links directly to detailed statistics of your model\n- Advanced comment filters like filter for pictures, rating, author reply, and boosts\n- Quick reply options\n- Option to manually blur used gift cards\n\nThis extension has only been tested on the MakerWorld.com/en/ website and currently does not support local variants of the website. In the future I might add support for local websites. I think I got all the bugs out but don't be surprised if you come across one. Just let me know and I will see if I can get it fixed! :)\n\nThis extension is a personal project and is not affiliated with Bambulabs! If Bambulabs updates Makerworld it can make the extension not function properly. Since I am a solo developer and mantain this extension for fun it can take me a while to update."
