Players can move the box position left and right to control the falling position of the box. When two identical squares are touched, they will be merged and eliminated to become larger squares.\n\nWhen the diamonds fall, there are several similar numbers adjacent to each other, which can eliminate 4 squares at the same time and get 4 times the number. The higher the number, the higher the score.\n\nThe later the game, the faster the box will fall. You can also use props to reduce the falling speed. Come and challenge the limit!"
