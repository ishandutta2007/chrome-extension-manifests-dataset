Students need to input math easily into plain textboxes like in google forms.  They also need to be able to easily show their work.   The students can make an equation in a friendly equation editor and the output is then changed into utf-8 encoded text that can be copied into any textbox (including google forms quizzes).  They can also show their work in the workflow box and copy it all over to the clipboard to be pasted into a question on google forms that has been set to take paragraph answers.  This allows students to work directly with forms instead of having to paste urls to images of their answers like with some other equation editors, which makes grading much less of a hassle.  I have included support for the mathematical symbols that I use in my high school classes and support for chemistry.  There is also support for adding italics, bold, and underline to text in google forms responses for language arts classes."
