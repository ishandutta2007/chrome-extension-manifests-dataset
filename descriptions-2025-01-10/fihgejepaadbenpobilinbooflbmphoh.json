In the background, the extension pulls the regularly-updated list of domains and sees if you are accessing one of them at any given point. If you are, it will issue an alert.\n\nIf you never access a malicious website marked by the organization, you will never even notice this extension. However, if you are entering a website marked as malicious, you will get an alert before going any further. \n\nTo try out the extension, visit \"example.com\" and you should get an alert. This website is not malicious, but is used around the internet for, as expected, example purposes. \n\nThe alert should be as follows: \"Watch out! The Cyber Threat Coalition marked this domain (example.com) as potentially malicious. Proceed with caution. Do as you wish, but I would recommend not sharing any data with this website.\"\n\nDoes not disrupt your browsing, does not access your data. Only gives you peace of mind - even if you never see an alert."
