We focus on alerting users when a website offers refunds and when they have auto subscription renewals. This MVP utilizes a question-and-answer NLP model that utilizes BURT vectors. \n\nOur long-term goal for this product is to use crowd-sourcing to build a reliable NLP model for legal jargon (which does not exist yet) and educate consumers. Future iterations also include updates to hitting more websites, implementing crowd sourcing, fine-tuning the model, and providing more areas of concern.\n\nTo learn more about us, our product, and our LLC, please visit our website: https://www.ahmedjoyce.com/"
