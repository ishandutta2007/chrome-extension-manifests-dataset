It'll recognize that the event name is 'call with the team,' the time is 7/3/2020 (the next day) at 3pm, and the location is Zoom.\n📅 Especially useful for emails that don't include an 'Add to calendar' button.\n\n👆 In order to use Add to gCal, right-click on the extension icon (the blue calendar) after downloading, click \"Options,\" connect your Google Calendar, and finally grant permissions.\n\n⌨ Shortcut: after highlighting an event, press and hold Ctrl+Shift+F on Windows, ChromeOS, and Linux or Command+Shift+F on Mac to open the event menu instantly.\n\n✅ Made the extension because the alternatives that I've tried on the web store are non-functional or don't handle location well.\n\n✅ Note that Add to gCal will only ever add an event that you deliberately specify to a calendar that you deliberately specify. Furthermore, the extension does not store any personally identifying information, event information, or account information.\n\n👩‍💻 Developers: The serverless API (AWS Lambda) that this extension communicates with has no database attached to it in the first place which ensures that no information is stored. No logging of event information takes place on the server either.\n\n🔏 To clarify all of this, the extension's privacy policy and terms of service can be found at https://addtogcal.herokuapp.com/privacy-policy."
