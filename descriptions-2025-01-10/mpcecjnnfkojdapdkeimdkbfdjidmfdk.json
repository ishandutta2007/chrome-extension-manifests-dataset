It has almost 7.5 million users across 44 different states and has been running since the year 1993. Teachers can enter test / assignment / quiz scores on the website, choose a weightage, and upload it to the website where students see their grades. However, many teachers are late with their grades and take a long time to upload them. In fact, some teachers publish grades only during the final week of school, inflicting immense amounts of stress on eager students who are nervous about their assignments. Many students want to see their grades after they take a test to analyze their grade and determine what they should improve on. Ez-Campus is a free-to-use Google Chrome extension that allows Infinite Campus users to enter and calculate their new grades. It allows users to see what more they need to do to bring their grades up. For example, if someone believes that they received an 85/100 on their math test at school, they can immediately enter that prospective score into Infinite Campus via Ez-Campus. Ez-Campus would show the exact same grade that would be present after the teacher enters that test score. By knowing their score well ahead of time, the student can determine what they should prepare for in the future."
