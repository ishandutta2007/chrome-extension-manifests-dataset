When at a character page in archchinese.com, this extension enables the user to scrape the character and words on the page, which are copied to the system clipboard in a format suitable for importing into Anki.\n\nBoth the traditional and simplified characters are copied when both are available, but please note that when there is not a one-to-one correspondence between traditional and simplified character, as with 复/復/複, you must manually add/edit the character definitions.\n\n[https://gist.github.com/Khouderchah-Alex/ebfc75ddbac177d0aef189da19b18920](This script) can be used such that words will only be added to a file when all of the characters are known:\n\nThe source code for this extension is available at:\nhttps://github.com/Khouderchah-Alex/ArchChinese-Scraper"
