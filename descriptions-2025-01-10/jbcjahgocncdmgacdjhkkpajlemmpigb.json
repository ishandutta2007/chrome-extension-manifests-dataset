You can buy accessories for your cat to allow them to show more of their personality, too!\n\nBring your virtual pet with you to keep you company as you work, shop, or complete any daily task.\n\n**Edit: Thank you all for enjoying Tabby Cats! If you create an account on MyTabbyCats.com after adding the extension, you will not get your 200 coins. If this applies to you, email me @ tabbycats.alic@gmail.com, and I'll add those into your account :) Alternatively, uninstalling and reinstalling this should work as well.\n\nAlso email me if you have any feedback or suggestions!\n\nUpdate 1.2:\n1) The size of this extension has been greatly decreased!\n2) Your cat now appears in the BOTTOM right corner of your screen! Using this myself, I have realized that there is always a button I have to click on in the top right, and although I love my cat Chubs, he always seemed to be in the way.\n\nUpdate 1.3:\nBug fix: on hover, your cat will now disappear for 3 seconds instead of flashing in and out."
