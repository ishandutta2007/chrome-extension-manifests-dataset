I install this on my kids chromebooks so they can click on school supplied youtube links without getting distracted, or without getting sucked into addicting related videos.\n\nI thank Google for approving this extension, because it's despearately needed. I encourage them to make a new site in the future \"kids educational youtube\". I don't find kidsyoutube.com a suitable site, because it still has all the toy marketing videos, and it lacks the wealth of amazing real long-tail educational content available on real youtube."
