Install the extension.\n2. Click on any TV show. Next to \"Episodes\" you should see a \"Random Episode\" button.\n3. If you're in the middle of playing an episode, you'll se a new button in the bottom right corner of the screen. It should look like two twin arrows. Click it, and you can switch to a random episode from there too.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nDeveloped by Flixed.io - A one-stop shop for learning about streaming and cord-cutting.\n\nChange log:\n\nV2.0.0 - We fixed an issue that was causing Hulu to flag this extension as an adblocker.\nV2.0.1 - The Random Button wasn't appearing on certain shows. This has also been fixed.\nV3.0.0 - Updated to become compatible with Hulu's latest design. Added a random episode button to the playback screen as well."
