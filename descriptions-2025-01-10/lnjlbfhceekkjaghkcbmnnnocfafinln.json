If you had saved playlists with my extension at least once, I have a record of all your songs so please message me and I will work to get these to you ASAP. \n\nThanks for using my project I hope you enjoyed it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRIP (restore Internet Playlists) for Grooveshark is an extension that will allow you to track the songs that are disappearing from your playlists. So you can add them right back in and enjoy your music. Enjoy"
