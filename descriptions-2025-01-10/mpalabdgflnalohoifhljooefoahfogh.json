This sort of reward makes the Inbox Zero approach to email more fun.\n\nInstall this extension, then use Gmail as normal. When you clear your inbox you will hear the fanfare. Tada!\n\nWhat is Inbox Zero?\nInbox Zero is a thing that was cooked up by Merlin Mann, of 43fold​ers​.com. It’s about how to reclaim your email, your atten­tion, and your life. That “zero?” It’s not how many mes­sages are in your inbox–it’s how much of your own brain is in that inbox. Especially when you don’t want it to be. That’s it.\n\nDonations gratefully received at: http://www.gingerbeardman.com/chrome/\n\nKnown issues: sometimes sounds on empty search results."
