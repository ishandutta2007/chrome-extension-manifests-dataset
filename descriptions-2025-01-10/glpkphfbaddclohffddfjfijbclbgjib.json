That's why we built the Sambot AI Assistant that allows anyone to have their own predictions in seconds, without writing code.\n\nIt is fundamentally designed for business people who work a lot with spreadsheets but don't have the skills/team to write complex machine learning code to generate meaningful predictions and insights for their business.\n\nIn addition, the tool marks a leap in UI and machine learning speed. Bringing you the fastest and easiest tool ever built.\n\nðŸ”® How it works:\n--------------------------------------------------\n- Install the extension in your browser.\n- In your spreadsheet where you have the data, click on the Sambot extension.\n- Choose the analysis you want and ask the Sambot AI Assistant to generate predictions for you.\n\nðŸ“ˆ What analysis do we have:\n\n* Time series analysis: s a Timeseries forecasting in simple words means to forecast or to predict the future value over a period of time. Examples of time series analysis in action include: Industry forecasts, Stock prices, Sales in units sold each day for a store, Average price of gasoline each day, Heart rate monitoring\n\n* Test A/B/n optimization: Is an optimization algorithm (MAB), which tests several alternatives and predicts which one will have the best result. Examples of optimization include: predictions of which pages convert the most, which campaigns bring in the most leads, which channels are the best\n\n* Auto analytics: We automatically generate correlations and insights with a neural network trained to predict the target column. With this, it is possible to find out which columns impact in the values of the target column"
