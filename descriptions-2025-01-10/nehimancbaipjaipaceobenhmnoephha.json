XCoach is a free Chrome Extension that helps you manage your time on X while on your laptop or desktop computer. It gives you the ability to create timed X sessions, has a snooze functionality, and allows you to write notes on the intervention page.\n\nThe intervention page offers:\n\n* A reminder of your priorities,\n* Insight into how long you've spent on X today and historically,\n* The ability to start timed X sessions, and,\n* A snooze feature for when you need a bit more time,\n* A text notepad for you to write your thoughts.\n\nThe data XCoach stores is yours and yours alone; it uses the Chrome sync storage which is data synced to your account (privacy policy located at https://mailchi.mp/4f4a32bb4dd9/xcoach). The only way to send me information is by filling out one of the Mailchimp forms linked in the footer, or emailing me (Ben) at baogorek@gmail.com.\n\nXCoach uses a \"content script\" to show a warning bar on X two minutes prior to closing, and to allow for a one minute snooze functionality. It is a very unintrusive addition to the X page that can be easily dismissed.\n\nThe XCoach code is open source! https://github.com/baogorek/XCoach"
