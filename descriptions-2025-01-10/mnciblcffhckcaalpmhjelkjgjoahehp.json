If you find any bugs or websites not supported, please email emojitabapp@gmail.com . \n\nWe may at some point charge a small amount to cover the cost of ongoing support, but we'll give all beta users a full year of free usage if we do so.\n\n**PERMISSIONS**\n\nOn installation, this chrome extension asks for a number of permissions because we need to be able to modify the pages you visit in order to attach the emoji tab icons. \n\nWe ask for and need: \n\n- storage permissions to save your icons \n- activeTab permissions to populate the extension popup when you open the extension\n- host/content script permissions (\"modify web pages you visit\") so we can modify web pages in order to replace the tab icon encoded on the page with your custom icon \n- scripting and tabs permissions in order to \"run once\" on pages you have already loaded when you first install the extension, so you don't have to refresh all your many tabs (because if you forget to refresh, it appears broken) \n\n**MINIMAL TRACKING**\n\nThis extension does not track any personal information, does not track the sites you visit, and does not track any custom text you might input to the fields on the extension. \n\nWe do track a few generic and anonymous events, in order to understand if people are using this extension and we should continue to support it. Specifically: \n\n- We track an \"event\" when you set an icon or when you delete it\n- We track an \"event\" when you load a page with a previously-set icon (but we *do not* track the url or title or any info about that page you loaded, just a generic \"icon loaded\" event)\n\nFor these events, we track what the icon is *only if* the icon is an emoji. If it's a custom string we only track the length of the string in characters, so that your custom inputs remain fully private. \n\nWe use Plausible (https://plausible.io/) for analytics because it's especially privacy-conscious and uses no tracking cookies."
