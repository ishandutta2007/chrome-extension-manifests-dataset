When you're logged in to your account, you can save these sessions, and view them on a Web page in the form of a tree diagram. This way, you can see the paths your browsing took, and how you ended up at any given page.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK? \nThis extension installs a simple button and popup. First, click the signup button (or the login button, once you have created an account) to be taken to the signup page. Once you have done this, you can begin saving sessions.\n\nClick the start button to begin recording, and all open Chrome pages will be saved. Each new page you open will be added to the session until you click the stop button.\n\nClick the visualization button to be taken to your visualizations page, where you can view eye-catching diagrams of your saved browsing sessions. \n\nWHO IS IT FOR? \nAnyone who does research on the Web, or anyone who has ever clicked on a page, and then wondered how their browsing led them down that Rabbit Hole."
