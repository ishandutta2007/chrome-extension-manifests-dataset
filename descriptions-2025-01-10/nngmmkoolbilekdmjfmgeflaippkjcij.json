By defaulting to action, you take the steps required to put your old self behind you. \n\nThere will be ups and downs in life, but as you diligently stick to a simple goal every day, you will find fulfillment in the things you do.  Its ok to miss a day as long as you always come back to accomplish your goals. \n\nReach out to me via email at \nScottLaughlinEngineering@gmail.com\n\n\nRelease notes:\n- Updated to manifest version 3.\n- fixed some reading errors on the images"
