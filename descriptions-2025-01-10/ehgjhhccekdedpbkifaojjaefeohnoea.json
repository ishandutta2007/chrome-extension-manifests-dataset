You can import your wallet by entering your seed phrase or connecting a hardware wallet like Trezor, Ledger, or Grid.\n\nQ: What does hybrid account abstraction mean?\nA: Ambire Wallet's hybrid account abstraction allows for the support of both Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Smart Accounts within the same wallet. This feature enables you to derive multiple EOAs and Smart Accounts from a single root key, such as your seed phrase or a hardware wallet.\n\nQ: How secure is Ambire Wallet?\nA: Ambire Wallet is open-source and developed by an experienced team. It supports major hardware wallets like Trezor, Ledger, and Grid for the utmost security. Additionally, it has been rigorously audited over 10 times, with no significant vulnerabilities found.\n\nQ: What EVM networks does Ambire Wallet support?\nA: Ambire Wallet supports all EVM-compatible networks. It provides the convenience of using the same address across different chains, even for Smart Accounts.\n\nQ: What is Ambire Legends, and how can I participate?\nA: Ambire Legends is a quest-based campaign designed exclusively for Ambire Wallet extension users. Participants can mint NFT characters, level them up, and engage in various onchain quests using Smart Accounts to earn experience points (XP). Accumulated XP contributes towards a share of the 195 million $WALLET token prize pool. The best part is that all activity across supported chains—Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Scroll, and Arbitrum—accrues XP. Plus, the first NFT character mint and the initial 3-wheel spins are sponsored and free.\n\n---\nLinks:\n\nWebsite: https://www.ambire.com/\nAmbire Legends: https://legends.ambire.com/\nHelp Center: https://help.ambire.com/hc/en-us\nFeature requests: https://forum.ambire.com/\nGithub: https://github.com/AmbireTech\n\nSocial Media\nX (Twitter): https://x.com/ambirewallet\nFarcaster: https://warpcast.com/ambirewallet\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ambire_Wallet/\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/ambire\nTelegram: https://t.me/AmbireOfficial\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.ambire.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://www.ambire.com/Ambire%20ToS%20and%20PP%20(26%20November%202021).pdf"
