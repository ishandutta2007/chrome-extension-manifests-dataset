With ICS to GCal this will take just two clicks - no need to open the Google Calendar settings and pollute your list of calendars.\n\nICS to GCal correctly imports recurrent events (to the extent they are supported  by Google Calendar) and automatically fixes some deviations from the iCalendar specification that are rather common (such as trailing commas in date lists, exceptional dates not specified with the correct time,...).\n\nHow to use:\n0. Before the first use, click on the extension symbol in the browser toolbar to allow access to you calendars.\n1. Right-click on a link to an iCal file (*.ics).\n2. Select a calendar under \"Add to calendar\".\nA popup notification will inform you about the number of events added and allow you to view the event or undo the changes while they have not been committed.\n\nSource code: <https://github.com/FabianHenneke/ics2gcal> (MIT License)\n\n\nPlease see below for libraries used and their associated license:\n\nical.js <https://github.com/mozilla-comm/ical.js>\n  Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0>\n\nchrome-promise <https://github.com/tfoxy/chrome-promise>\n  The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Tom√°s Fox\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
