This means you can learn a new language while browsing Reddit, Twitter, Substack, and more. \n\nUnlike other extensions, you can customize how much of the content on your screen you'd like translated. This means that you won't be overwhelmed, while still learning vocabulary.\n\nOur method is more effective than traditional flashcards since you learn the usage of words in context, allowing you to gain a deeper understanding.\n\nWe value privacy. Your data will NEVER be sold to 3rd parties. If you'd like to understand the permissions our extension asks for, we've documented them clearly here: https://www.usegoodbye.com/privacy"
