Testim Automate uses AI to give you the speed and stability of codeless end-to-end tests, with the flexibility of code. Customers like Microsoft, Salesforce, Wix, and JFrog run millions of tests on Testim each month. Learn more at www.testim.io \n\nTESTIM AUTOMATE:\n\nQuickly record, configure, and customize functional UI tests. \n\nRecord user journeys that are added to the Testim visual editor as discrete, configurable steps. Create reusable groups, configure validations, add loops, or insert custom JavaScript. \n\nReduce maintenance with AI-based Smart Locators\n\nEach element is uniquely identified by analyzing the entire DOM and assigning a score. When element attributes change, the AI-based Smart Locators learn and continue to identify the element and test its functionality. \n\nExecute CI-driven cross-browser tests\n\nRun parallel, cross-browser tests on our test cloud or Selenium-compatible grids. Integrate with your CI or dev tools to trigger test runs on pull requests or other dev milestones.\n\nTroubleshoot failed tests fast\n\nQuickly identify the root cause of failures with screenshots, console logs, and network info. Capture video or annotate screenshots to send meaningful bug reports.\n\nThe Testim Chrome extension only used for the purpose of creating and playing-back web application UI tests in Testim. No additional information is captured when not actively using the Testim application."
