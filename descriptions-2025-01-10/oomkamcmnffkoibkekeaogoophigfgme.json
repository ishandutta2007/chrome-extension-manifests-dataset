Singles are available for streaming as well, and in a future update, a few select samples recorded by Desolo Sub Humus will be available for downloading and remixing in your own work.\n\nThis extension is available for free, includes over 5 hours of music, and requires no permissions. (ðŸš«DRM)\n\n-The install will take a bit longer than many other extensions due to the large size of the extension, but this is because all music, animation, and images will be available to you locally; you will not need an active internet connection or wi-fi to listen to or watch any part of this extension."
