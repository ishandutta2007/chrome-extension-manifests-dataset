Login once, setup the board and saving a link to the current page is just one click on the extension button away.\n\n‚ö° Quick and Snappy\nCard creation is immediate, no waiting for Trello to load. Click the button and the page is saved!\n\n‚≠ê Features and Available Options \n- Quickly open the created task via the notification to add more information\n- Right-click anywhere on the page to create a task\n- Include selected text in the created task or use it as a title\n- Close the current tab at the same time (use it as a \"read later\" button)\n\nThis extension works well if you use an \"Inbox\" or \"Read later\" type list where you write down new things that you want to remember or re-visit. The \"close tab\" option can help: it automatically closes the tab if you hit the extension button. \n\nThe extenstion button is too far away? Right-clicking anywhere on a page also shows a One-click send to Trello button! If you select text before right-clicking, it will be used as the card description.\n\nüìã Changelog\n3.0.0\n- Updated to manifest v3 (rewrite of ca. 80% of the code)\n- Fixed login issues for new users\n- Added option to select card position in list\n2.6.0\n- Renamed extension to One-Click Trello\n- Reworked options UI for future expandability and improved usability"
