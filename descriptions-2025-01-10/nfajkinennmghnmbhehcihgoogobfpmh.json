However, a substantial proportion of students and staff members strongly dislike the design of the new logo: it is ugly, does not respect the most basic 2D design patterns, and fails to properly represent the university.\n\nThis extension does its best to reverse the ill-designed logo and atrocious colour scheme on the Imperial College website as well as some of its subsidiary teaching platforms. Note that it may not cover all places and pages since I focused on the pages that I use the most. Of course, any suggestions and additions are welcome!"
