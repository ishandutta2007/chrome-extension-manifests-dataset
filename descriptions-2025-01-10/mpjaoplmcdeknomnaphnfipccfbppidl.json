The development team apologizes for the app breaking.\n\nAs a Latin student myself I was often frustrated with constantly switching tabs to look up Latin vocabulary and I'm sure I wasn't the only one irritated by this. Wouldn't it be so much better if there was a way to look up words without switching tabs? This extension uses the wonderful application designed by the late William Whitaker (through a website set up by University Notre Dame) to seamlessly bring you Latin definitions while you're working, without ever needing you to leave the page you're working on. Carpe diem!\n\nHow To Use: Using this extension is incredibly easy, all you have to is double click on a word and the definition will appear. If you want to look up many words at once you can either drag-highlight the words and then right click and select 'Get definitions' from the Whitaker's Words Helper menu, or double click and drag. If you want to see only definitions, without the possible parts of speech, check the definitions only option. The Whitaker's Words Helper right click menu also has a 'Get scansion' option that will scan the selected text for dactylic hexameter. Finally, if you want to disable the extension, click on the icon in the top left, next to the search bar and click the toggle to disable the extension.\n\nThe original Whitaker's Words site can be found at https://latin-words.com.
