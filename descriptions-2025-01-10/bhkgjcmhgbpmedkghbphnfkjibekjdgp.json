As bypassing this type of technology is a game of cat-and-mouse, the code of the extension will be updated as often as possible to remain effective. As of January 2021, it is effective against all known implementations of Admiral's AdBlock Recovery. If you have any issue, please report non-functioning websites.\n\nThe better alternative to Admiral, for publishers, is Scroll. Scroll is a tool that allows readers to pay websites in micro transactions instead of viewing ads. It provides two clear choices: 1) Read for free and see ads, or 2) Provide a few cents to read without ads. This is much better than forcing everybody to have to put up with ads."
