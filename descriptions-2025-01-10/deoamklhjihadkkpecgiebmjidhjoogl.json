For example, language translation, processing, cleaning of raw data\n\nThis is a great solution to save on token costs when automatically processing documents with many tokens, or as a backup option for official API services, and to maximize the use of free resources from Bing Chat, Google Bard and Copilot\n\nEspecially, when one or several AI services experience issues or are down, the auto-switching feature between engines always helps keep your application stable, safe, and as fail-safe as possible\n\nFor instance, when ChatGPT is overloaded, Mono API can automatically transfer your prompt to other platforms like Google Bard, Bing Chat, or Claude to ensure you always receive a completion."
