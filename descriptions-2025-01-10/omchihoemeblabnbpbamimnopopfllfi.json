It checks matches suggested by Xero and clicks the OK button for you for those that match perfectly.\n\nSimply press the Start button when you are on the Bank reconciliation page of your Xero account. The Xero Reconcile Robot will click those pesky \"OK\" buttons ONLY AND ONLY IF it confirms one of the two following cases:\n\n1) the suggested match has a reference code that perfectly matches on both sides\n2) Xero suggested to create a new transaction based on a matching Bank Rule\n \nThe Xero Reconcile Robot was create to be used along with Stripe and Stripe Direct Feeds in Xero, to create a perfect accounting integration for businesses using Stripe or any automated payment processor. This way, you can automatically handle thousands of transactions each day and have your books in perfect shape. More information on Stripe Direct Feeds in Xero can be found on this page: https://central.xero.com/s/article/Stripe-direct-feeds\n\nIf you need help using the Robot or you have any suggestions, please reach out, or read the post from our blog (click on \"Support\" link above or visit this page: https://www.yodeck.com/news/integrating-xero-and-stripe-with-our-saas ).\n\nMade with love by yodeck.com -- the top Digital Signage platform\n\nNote: You will need to refresh any already opened Xero reconciliation page after you have installed the extension."
