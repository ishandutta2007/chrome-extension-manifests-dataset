Yet there are a few small interface tweaks and additional features that can drastically improve our experience while browsing through items and comments which this extension implements.\n\nHopefully, in due course, a few of these tweaks can be implemented by Hacker News themselves. You can help too by emailing hn@ycombinator.com!\n\nDetails regarding the features, such keyboard mappings can be viewed here: https://github.com/plibither8/refined-hacker-news#highlights\n\nThe extension has been inspired by Sindre Sorhus's extension \"Refined GitHub\"."
