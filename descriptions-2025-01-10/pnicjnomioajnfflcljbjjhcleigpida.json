The objective of the game is to move a stack of disks from one tower to another, following a few simple rules. The catch is that you can only move one disk at a time, and larger disks must always be placed below smaller ones.\n\nIn this Chrome Extension version of Tower of Hanoi, you can enjoy the game for free on the website https://leveldevil.net/. The game provides a user-friendly interface where you can easily drag and drop the disks to move them between the towers.
