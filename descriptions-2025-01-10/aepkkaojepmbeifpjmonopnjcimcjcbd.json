Using Verified Access, you can configure fine-grained access for your applications, ensuring that application access is granted only when users meet the specified security requirements (e.g., user identity and device security status).\n \nThe browser extension links the device security status to AWS Verified Access. If you are not using device security status in access policies, then your users don't need the browser extension.\n \nBy downloading the browser extension for AWS Verified Access, you agree to the AWS customer agreement, AWS service terms, and AWS privacy notice. If you already have an AWS customer agreement, or other agreement governing your use of the AWS services, you agree that the terms of that agreement govern your download and use of this service.\n \nAWS collects performance metrics, including metrics about your software and hardware configuration and usage patterns. Unless you affirmatively consent, we do not collect personal information like usernames or email address."
