For such websites you can use Center-Pages. Center-Pages simply adds a margin to the sides, which you can increase/decrease via two buttons. \n\n\n## Open Source\n\nCenter-Pages is Open-Source Software. The source code can be found at: https://github.com/feluxe/Center-Pages\n\n\n## Known Issues\n\nThe extension API does not allow for a clean implementation of this feature. Center-Pages is able to narrow down a lot of pages, but it doesn't work for all.\n\n## New in version 1.2.1\n\n* Add alignment buttons (left, center, right).\n* Cleanup UI.\n\n## New in version 1.1.0\n\n* Remember margin sizes: Center-Pages now remembers the margin sizes, so that you have to set them only once for each website.\n\n* Use simpler method to apply margins: Center-Pages now uses a simpler less conflicting method to apply the margins."
