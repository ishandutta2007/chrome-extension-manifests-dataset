It presents article web pages in a format optimized for reading.\n\nTo use recrun, install the extension, navigate to an article web page, and click the eyeglasses icon in the Chrome toolbar (there is an arrow pointing to this icon in the recrun screenshot).\n\nOptionally, recrun can use the Diffbot Article API to extract relevant content. A Diffbot token is required for this, and must be entered in recrun's options. If Diffbot is enabled, each usage of recrun will make a Diffbot API call with your Diffbot token, using the url of the page that you are viewing. By default, media specified in the Diffbot response will be retrieved and displayed in the recrun overlay. This can be disabled in recrun's options. By default, recrun's output uses the *html* field from the Diffbot response. This can be disabled in recrun's options.\n\nrecrun's options (including Diffbot token), are saved unencrypted in localStorage."
