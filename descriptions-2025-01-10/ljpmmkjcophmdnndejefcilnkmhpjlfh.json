The CodeSignal extension will generate a “Create Interview Link” option directly within the Greenhouse or Lever ATS, which you can click to automatically generate an interview link that will be auto-filled into your ATS (for Greenhouse) or can be easily copied (for Lever).\n\nTo get started, simply download the extension and log in to your CodeSignal company account. If you’re not using Greenhouse or Lever, click on the CodeSignal extension icon to get started! If you are using Greenhouse or Lever, then open a candidate's profile in your ATS, and autogenerate a CodeSignal interview link with the click of a button!"
