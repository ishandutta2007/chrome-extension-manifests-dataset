We created Buyzos so you can still take advantage of these features, without making Bezos any richer. Just shop on Amazon as usual and then Buyzos will let you know where you can buy products direct from small businesses, or smaller \"indie\" websites. \n\nYou will see a link that says \"Buy from Source.\" When clicked, Buyzos will do its best to find the creator of the product and link you directly to the product page. The results page will open in a new window and be ranked in order of how good the match is. We are working on improving the display of this results page :) \n\nWe hope to build out Buyzos to include more filters—such as environmentally sustainable or Black-owned alternatives—so this version is just the start!\n\nCheck out Buyzos.com to donate or learn more."
