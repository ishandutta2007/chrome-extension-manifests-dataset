You can navigate to the page you'd like to copy/paste from and click the extension icon in Chrome and then \"Allow Copy/Paste\". Generally this should work for most sites and allow you to carry on like normal. The extension will also store your preferences so you'll only need to do this once for each site.\n\nHowever, if that doesn't work you can also open Chrome Developer Tools and select the \"Allow Copy/Paste\" tab which will then give you a button to reload the page and attempt to prevent the blocking script from being added. https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open"
