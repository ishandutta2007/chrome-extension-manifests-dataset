This extension removes all of those related answers, improving the clarity of the UI. You can now finally assume that all the answers under a question are actually responding to that initial question.\n\nThis extension does not remove related questions, as those might be helpful. They also take up way less space, so it's not super cluttering.\n\nTo ensure that all related answers are deleted even as new ones are loaded in, the script will run periodically."
