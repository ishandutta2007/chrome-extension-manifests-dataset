And that's specially annoying if you use browse anonymously or automatically delete cookies after finishing.\n\nThis plugin removes or hides cookie warnings from most of the websites, saving you lots of clicks!\n\nThere are millions of websites on the internet. Some of them use \"similar\" tools to include those cookie warnings so they're easy to remove.\n\nSome others are very specific or even weird, so they're more difficult to be detected. If you find a website where the extension doesn't work, just let us know (\"report\" option) and I'll fix it asap."
