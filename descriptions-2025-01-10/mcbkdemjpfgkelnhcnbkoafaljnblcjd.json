Now, with Telescope, you can see it every time you open a new tab. You can click the title to visit NASA's website that contains an explanation of the picture as written by a professional astronomer. Clicking the picture fades everything else to black allowing you to focus in on all of the details.\n\nIf there's trouble downloading the picture, a randomly selected picture from the library of bundled images will be loaded instead. They're straight from NASA and high-resolution to boot.\n\n\"Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.\" - Plato"
