After installing this extension, you will find a small indicator next to every password field, telling you how many characters may be entered into that specific field. In case there is no character limit, infinity will be displayed. This way, you will have never to figure manually (for instance by digging in the source code of the website) how many characters are allowed to be entered in a password field.\n\nOne Note: in case there is no limit set on a password field, this does not automatically mean that the website will accept passwords with any length. Instead, it can happen that after submitting the form containing the password field, you'll get a validation error, telling you no more than XYZ characters are allowed. Unfortunately, this information may not be visible or detectable before actually submitting a form."
