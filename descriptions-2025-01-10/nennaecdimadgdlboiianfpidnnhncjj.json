Access your videos from anywhere and on any device and easily use them with other Google cloud services such as Google Classroom, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Forms.\n\nWhat are time-lapse videos used for? The practical uses for time-lapse videos in education are endless. Students and teachers record themselves solving problems, and using time-lapse technology, the videos are dramatically reduced in length and size, making them quicker to watch and easier to share. For a teacher, this means it becomes much easier to check your students’ understanding of their work.\n\n★ Effortless time-lapse videos\nRecord using your webcam and make outstanding time-lapse videos. Adjust the playback speed, add your own music (or choose from our selection of royalty-free songs!), trim and perfect your videos before they are automatically uploaded to Google Drive.\n\n★ Google Drive and Google Classroom integration\nAll time-lapse videos are automatically saved to your Google Drive account, guaranteeing that they are secure and that you save a lot of time by not having to transfer and back up everything manually. Upload your videos directly to Google Classroom and use them as supporting documents for an Answer, an Assignment, or a Question.\n\n★ Camera controls\nTake advantage of the in-built camera controls. The Zoom (up to 6x) slider can help you zoom in to get the perfect shot. The Rotate control can rotate the camera display clockwise and counterclockwise in increments of 90°. Selfie Mode can reverse the camera feed to ensure that you aren’t viewing things backward.\n\nIf you own an OKIOCAM, you can also take advantage of these impressive features:\n\n★ Additional camera controls\nThe Exposure slider lets you adjust your camera’s exposure settings on the fly. The One Button Auto Adjust feature will automatically correct your camera’s focus, exposure, and white balance settings to ensure that you get the very best shot.\n\nAbout OKIOCAM:\n\nWith an adjustable arm, ultra-thin foldable base, and a 360-degree rotating camera supporting super high definition resolutions, OKIOCAM makes it easy for teachers and students to take photos or videos of all their non-digital work. Whether it’s math homework, drawings, arts and crafts, STEM/STEAM projects, or 3D objects, OKIOCAM enables you to transport the physical classroom into the digital realm. Use OKIOCAM with our ever-growing exciting library of apps and extensions including Snapshot and Recorder, Stop Motion, and Time-Lapse for the complete experience.\n\nComments? Questions?
