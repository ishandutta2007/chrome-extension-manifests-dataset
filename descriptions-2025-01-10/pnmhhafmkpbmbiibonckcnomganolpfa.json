Easy to use, and support for more streaming services coming soon.\n\nThis extension does not guarantee the complete transfer of your playlist, because only those songs which are an exact match in terms of album and artist are exported to Spotify. The developer is not responsible for any changes in your Google Play Music or Spotify or streaming configuration. Use this at your own risk.\nFor any feature request or bugs, please leave it in the comments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInstructions\n1. Please ensure a stable internet connection to have a successful transfer.\n2. Do not close the extension, when exporting as it may dismiss the process.\n3. Follow the step by step process to ensure maximum success.\n\n\nSupport for more music streaming services coming soon. This tool is by no means supported by Spotify or Google.\n\nDevelopers and Collaborators: https://github.com/jawzf/Switcheroo\n\nCreated by Joseph Kuriackal (@jawzf) 2018"
