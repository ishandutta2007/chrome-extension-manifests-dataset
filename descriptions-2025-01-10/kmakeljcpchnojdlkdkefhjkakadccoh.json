How many times have you asked someone testing your software what browser they were using? Exactly what URL they were on? Exactly what they typed, where they clicked, what they saw?\n\nThe Codex Recorder extension exists to make that all go away.\n\nWith a simple \"record\" button, you can track all the information about a browser session that you need to debug your app. Use it to generate a shareable link, with an event history that is easy to step through, details for each event, and an inspectable playback window."
