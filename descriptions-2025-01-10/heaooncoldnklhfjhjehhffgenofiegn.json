It's drastic to block YouTube just because it's easy to get distracted and watch unproductive videos while you are using it to learn something for work or school. Block unproductive video searches instead\n\nScenario, you are watching a tutorial on YouTube, and before you have even finished watching the video, you might be searching YouTube for funny cat videos instinctively! This extension will block that unproductive search and will only allow searches that contain the words or phrases you allowed\n\nWhen opening YouTube without Pictaflow, you are greeted with videos that can grab your attention. And before you know it, you are already watching tons of unproductive videos, forgetting that you opened YouTube to study something\n\nWith Pictaflow, productivity wallpaper is your home page for your YouTube instead of suggested videos. Productivity wallpaper hides the suggested videos,  this is the initial step to curb the user's tendency to click unproductive videos\n\nStay focused & improve productivity while using YouTube. Block any distracting and unproductive videos\n\nmacOS Safari: https://apps.apple.com/app/pictaflow/id6448951838"
