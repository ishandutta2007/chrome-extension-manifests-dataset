Whether you want to have a video with proper controls and subtitles on top of your screen or an article that you are taking inspiration from before your eyes, this extension will help you.\n\nPlease note, however, that some pages will not behave correctly when their elements are in PiP mode.\n\nHow to use:\n\nPress a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-P)\nor\nClick on the extension icon in the toolbar\nor \nRight-click on the page and select \"Picture-in-Picture Anything\" to open the Element Selection Overlay\n\nSelect an element by clicking the left mouse button on it.\n\nHolding a Shift button when selecting an element will open a Precise Selection Panel. There, you can navigate the element tree and select precisely an element you want.\n\nPressing ESC before selecting an element will close the window.\n\nSometimes, you may want to play around with the element you choose to achieve the desired effect (selecting either a parent or child element may help you if an element doesn't behave correctly). \n\nPlease let me know if something needs to be fixed or if you have ideas for improvement.\n\n\nGithub repository: \nhttps://github.com/boryssey/picture-in-picture-anything"
