It was a decent free tool that added this crucial functionality to the Cloud Reader. But it has been recently bought out by a different company and the free extension no longer works. All of their efforts are on selling their \"Pro\" version.\n\nFortunately, the tool was originally open source. We were able to take the open source (MIT Licensed) portion of the code and begin this new free Chrome Extension. It picks up right where the old working Kindle Optimizer left off. We plan to fix a number of the small bugs and add a few basic enhancements."
