It allows you to save all the tabs in a window for later use. With just one click, TabNest saves all tabs and groups in the window, then closes itâ€”reducing clutter and freeing up system resources. You can easily access and reopen the saved tabs, making the switch between projects or tasks seamless.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Save all open tabs in the current window for later use and close the window.\n- Reopen saved tabs in a new window with a single click. TabNest saves and restores the exact tab and group configurations from when they were saved, including group name, color, collapse status, and active tab.\n- Update, rename, and delete saved links.\n- Sync saved tabs across devices using Chrome account storage.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/tokedo/TabNest"
