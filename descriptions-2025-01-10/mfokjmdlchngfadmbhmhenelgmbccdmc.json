    "en_US": "Kakuy is a search engine (unconventional) which works from the rest of the search engines (Google, Yahoo!, Yandex, Bing and Baidu) connecting users of those search engines who at that moment are doing the same search, allowing them to exchange and contrast the information found. Moreover, KakuyLive makes searches more social because unlike the current search engines that limit social search to the members of a social network, and within this to the user's contacts; Kakuy understands that the largest social network in the world is the Internet and contacts are all its users."
