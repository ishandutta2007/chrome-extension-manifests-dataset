This handy tool allows you to decode URL-encoded strings, a common encoding scheme used in web addresses, directly from your browser.\n\nHere's how it works: When you enter a URL into the tool, it automatically decodes any URL-encoded characters into a more human-readable format using UTF-8 encoding. The decoded URL is then immediately copied to your clipboard for ease of use, and you receive an alert to confirm this action.\n\nBut that's not all. URL Decoder also includes a history feature, allowing you to revisit any URLs you've decoded in the past. With a single click, you can view a list of all previously entered URLs and their corresponding decoded outputs.\n\nWhether you're a developer who frequently works with URLs, or just someone who wants to understand what those strange characters in your address bar mean, URL Decoder is a handy tool to have at your disposal."
