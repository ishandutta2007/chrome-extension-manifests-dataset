You’ll enjoy perfectly synced audio and video when streaming PC audio to wireless speakers using TuneBlade, Airfoil, or Sonos. It intelligently delays video playback to match the sound delay from wireless transmission, giving you a smooth, seamless media experience without any frustrating lag.\n\nThis extension isn't built for any specific website—it works on all websites. No matter where you're watching, it ensures your video and wireless audio are perfectly synced across all platforms.\n\nNote: This extension is still in early development. While I'm excited to share this preview version with you, more convenient features are currently in progress. Stay tuned for future updates!\n\nGithub: https://github.com/maggch97/Frame-Sync"
