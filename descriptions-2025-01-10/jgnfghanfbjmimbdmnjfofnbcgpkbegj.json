The extension adds an action button to your browser toolbar area. Pressing the button opens a panel that displays all the matching credentials for the current domain. You can ask the extension to insert the username, password, or both by pressing the action buttons. The extension also optionally submit the login form if you would like to. This extension offers a built-in OTP (One-time password) tool, so you don't need to have a separate plugin. \n\nThis extension supports the following applications:\n1. KeePass application with KeePassHttp installed\n2. KeePassXC with a custom manifest (uses native messaging to communicate)\n3. Direct read of KDBX3 or KDBX4 databases (when you cannot install a native application)\n4. Any other alternatives that support HTTP communication (such as MacPass)\n\nNotes:\n1. When using this extension, first make sure the login or password input box is focused on the page before opening the panel. Username and password filling occur if an input element is selected on a form.\n2. It is recommended to use the extensions manager of your browser to define a custom shortcut for this extension. This way you can fill the username and password fields without using your mouse. This extension supports keyboard shortcuts for almost all the actions.\n3. It is possible to generate one-time password tokens using this extension.\n4. This extension optionally supports automatic logins (this feature is not yet supported on manifest v3).\n4. This extension also supports native messaging communication for  KeePassXC. Go to the options page to configure the extension to work with KeePassXC.\n5. As of version 0.6.7, the extension supports reading the native string fields of KeePass for generating time-based passwords (\"TimeOtp-Secret-Base32\", \"TimeOtp-Period\" and \"TimeOtp-Length\" keys are supported)\n6. If you are not using the built-in OTP feature of the KeePass application, the OTP can optionally be stored in SHA-256 encryption. This is additional password protection for your secret keys.\n\nFAQs Page:\n  https://webextension.org/listing/keepass-helper.html\nBug Reports:\n  https://github.com/belaviyo/keepass-macpass-helper/\nPrivacy Policy:\n  https://add0n.com/policies/unixeco.txt\n\nSetup to work with KeePass application:\nRequirements:\n1.
