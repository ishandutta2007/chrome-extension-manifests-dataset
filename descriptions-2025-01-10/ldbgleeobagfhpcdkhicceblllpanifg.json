Regularly, we make a spreadsheet to rate and compare the places -  do we like the location, has it got a kitchen, is it work friendly? We ask these questions among a ton of others.\n\nAirbnb is great - but it misses the usual user flow - the final pick!\nhttps://alex-goff.medium.com/why-airbnbs-ui-is-frustrating-for-the-last-act-b5c573d9d242\n\nFinally, I have got round to making a simple Chrome extension to do it for us - and I figured it may be useful to others too!\n\nOh, and don't be a stranger! Message me your ideas, let's have a chat!\n\nCheers,\nAlex\n\nPs: Follow me on Twitter! https://twitter.com/AlexCharlesGoff\n\nPs: Thank you to all that voted this product for Product hunt! https://www.producthunt.com/posts/compairbnb"
