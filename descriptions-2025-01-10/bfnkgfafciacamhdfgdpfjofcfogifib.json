The method implemented in order to achieve this is by attempting to reduce the amount of thinking you need to do while researching something.  Another goal is to provide a convenience--we want to reduce the number of tabs and to free users from being forced to open links in new tabs during a research phase.  This extension adds bookmarks under Research Assist, the icon allows you to access a list of the current marks added.\n\nThis is a school project.  This is an open source project, source code is here: https://github.com/waterlgndx/ResearchAssist/\nYou can also fill out a survey for feedback: http://goo.gl/forms/L6WDOdIKlI"
