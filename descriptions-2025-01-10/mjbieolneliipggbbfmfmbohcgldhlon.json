While such data might be helpful for your friends, these recorded feelings also enable increased surveillance, government profiling, more targeted advertising, and emotional manipulation. Go Rando is a web browser extension that obfuscates how you feel on Facebook. Every time you click “Like”, Go Rando randomly chooses one of the six “reactions” for you. Over time you appear to Facebook’s algorithms as someone whose feelings are emotionally “balanced”—as someone who feels Angry as much as Haha or Sad as much as Love. You can still choose a specific reaction if you want to, but even that choice will be obscured by an emotion profile increasingly filled with noise. In other words, Facebook won’t know if your reaction was genuine or not. Want to see what Facebook feels like when your emotions are obscured? Go Rando. \n\n[Updated for the 2020 Facebook redesign]\n\n[Supports English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Danish — may work for some others too]"
