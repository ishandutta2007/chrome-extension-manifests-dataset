I have used it myself and it works well. So, I decided to put it in an extension to help others as well.\n\nIt should be noted that the reason behind Grammarly not working with Ghost's editor is due to it not supporting it. So, I am not sure if this solution will cause any problems on your side. For me, it works perfectly well.\n\nNote: This extension assumes you already have the Grammarly extension installed in your browser\n\nIf you find any issues or bugs, please submit it to the GitHub repository.\n\nExtension icon is from Dinosoft Lab on Iconscout at https://iconscout.com/contributors/dinosoftlabs"
