You need Longbox!\n\nLongbox is built for just such large-archive, serialized web sites (be they webcomics, blogs, fanfic, or whatever). Go to the first entry you want to start reading, then click the Longbox icon in your Chrome toolbar and add the site to your reading pile. Now, read the site as usual, and Longbox will keep track of the most recent page you read. No need to keep a tab open for days and weeks on end until you catch up, or manually adding and removing bookmarks every time you read -- next time you want to read, just click on the site in Longbox's reading pile, and pick up right where you left off!\n\nLongbox takes the hassle out of catching up."
