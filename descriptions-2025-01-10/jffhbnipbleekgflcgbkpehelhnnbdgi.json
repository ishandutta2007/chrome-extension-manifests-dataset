This slows down workflow when reviewing code changes.\n\nThis applies to...\n1. Pull Request file diffs pages\n2. Commit diffs pages\n\nThe extension detects if the white space setting is toggled by checking for the `w` in the URL query/search parameters. If the query param is not set to anything, the extension adds w=1 (hide white space).\n\nBy checking for the existence of the `w` param, it will allow users to have w=0 on purpose if they want to purposely show white space.\n\n==========\n\nThere is an existing extension for this, however, I believe they're not secure enough. My extension only uses a Chrome content script (scripts that only run in the context of one tab/page) and is limited only to https://github.com/*\n\nThe URL check function runs when you navigate to a page on github.com and when the URL changes within the current page.\n\n==========\n\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/hmh84/i-hate-github-whitespace\nIssues and Feature Requests: https://github.com/hmh84/i-hate-github-whitespace/issues"
