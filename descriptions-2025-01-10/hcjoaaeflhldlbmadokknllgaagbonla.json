That way, you'll never lag behind what your competitors are doing, or what your customers are saying about you.\n\nFetcher works completely local, which means we use your web-browser to do the listening. Sites visited are not (and never will be!) sent to Fetcher.\n\nBy leaving the Fetcher tab open, it does a content pull every 10 minutes. Fetcher only pulls posts which are new, and notifies you when new content."
