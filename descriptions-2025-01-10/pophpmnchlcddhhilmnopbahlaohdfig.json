In this article we tell you everything about this must-have for all Fasterize users.\n\nThis extension allows to obtain several informations:\n\nThe protocol used to serve the page: HTTP / 1.1 or HTTP / 2.0\n\nThe toggle button: it allows to switch from the optimized version to the non-optimized version and thus to check if a page is broken by Fasterize.\n\nThe Debug section: it is particularly useful for the Fasterize team (when configuring client sites for example). It gives key information when opening a ticket to support.\n\nThe X-fstrz field: it gives details on the status of the optimization by Fasterize. The exact meaning of each letter is indicated on the flyby. The full list is available here (see the Header section).\n\nThe X-unique-id field: this one is a reference number. It allows the support team to easily find the logs associated with the optimization and reproduce the bugs faster.\n\nThe Fstrz cookie: particularly useful during an A / B test, it allows to know if the session is optimized or not (true: optimized, false: not optimized).\n\nThe cookie fstrz_vary: At Fasterize, we apply a segmentation of the hidden pages. Thus, each cached page has different hidden versions: according to the browsers, the terminals or according to a specific cookie (we use the value of a cookie in our cache key).\nThanks to this \"cookie fstrz_vary\" field, we know if the page is hidden according to a particular segment.\n\nThe \"enable trace\" button is used to trace more debug information in the logs."
