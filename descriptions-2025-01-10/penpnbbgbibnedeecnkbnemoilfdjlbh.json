It allows you to get automatic suggestions of new, existing or unknown term occurrences on webpages, making your vocabulary creation effortless. \n\nWhenever you come back to a previously annotated website, your annotations will appear exactly as you left them, allowing you to smoothly resume your work wherever you've left off.\n\nTermIt is a tool to manage vocabularies, terms and resources in which are the terms defined and used. It is focused on management of terms based on their semantics – i.e. two ‘same’ terms in different vocabularies may have different meaning. Now, with TermIt Annotate, you can take the same great features it offers to any page of the web!"
