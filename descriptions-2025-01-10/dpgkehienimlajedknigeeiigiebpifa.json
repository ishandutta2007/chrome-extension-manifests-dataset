Just login with your Google account and begin, no forms to fill in, we only use your Google account for authentication.\n\nPLATFORM\nbootzee.com is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, this platform shares the same infrastructure that serves Google's Search, Adwords, Youtube, Google+ and Gmail products.\n\nThe app is built using Python on App Engine with the data objects stored in Cloud Datastore and the web assets stored in Cloud Storage.\n\nCODE EDITOR\nHand crank the code (HTML, Less, CSS and Javascript) using the popular Ace Editor. We've deployed it with the Source Code Pro font, enhancing it's visual appeal.\n\nVISUAL EDITOR\nOnce the layout is ready, add content using the TinyMCE Visual Editor. We've configured it in with \"fullpage\" mode, to allow complete pages to be edited.\n\nLESS\nWe've incorporated the Less CSS pre-processor. All you have to do is switch over to Less mode when creating a CSS file and the compilation is taken care of automatically when you save.\n\nIMAGES\nImages are uploaded to Google's Cloud Storage, from there the images are delivered through Google's global CDN and the same image can be dynamically reduced to a web-suitable size.\n\nMINIFY\nWe've added on demand minifying to CSS and Javascript files.  Once switched on your CSS and Javascript files will be either minified on next load and then cached.\n\nREADY TO GO\nEverything is on-line, cloud hosted and ready to go.  There is no downloading and unzipping of templates.  There is no need to set up a development environment.  There is no need to have complicated deployment scripts."
