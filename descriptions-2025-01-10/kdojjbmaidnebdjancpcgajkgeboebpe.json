Then, they take a 20-30% commission on your booking all for themselves. But when you use The Guestbook Chrome Extension, we split the hotel’s commission with you!\n\nSave money on hotels with The Guestbook Chrome Extension – your passport to 5% cash back on every hotel stay! 🌍✨\n\n🌟 Triple dip your rewards: Earn 5% cash back, plus get all your credit card points and hotel loyalty rewards when you book directly on the hotel website.\n\n💸 Redeem your earnings: The Guestbook secures 5% cash back on every direct hotel booking. Put money back in your wallet via Venmo, PayPal, Visa, or choose from tons of gift card options.\n\n🛌 No change to your booking routine: The ultimate travel hack – book as usual, except now get an additional 5% cash back every time you book.\n\n💼 60,000+ hotels: Explore over 60,000 hotels across most major brands. Whether it's a luxury getaway or a budget stay, we've got you covered.\n\n🎉 Automatic deal notifications: Get automatically notified when you can book directly on the hotel’s website for the best deal and triple dip your rewards, no other hotel price tracker needed.\n\n🥂 Earn hotel elite status: When you use our extension to book direct and triple dip your rewards, you get one step closer to earning the hotel’s coveted “elite status” (and all the perks that come with it).\n\n🛀 Beat third party booking platforms: When you use third-party booking platforms, they prevent you from earning hotel rewards, make cancelations difficult, and minimize your access to the hotel’s customer service team.\n\n🚀 Seamless installation: Installing our extension is a breeze – quick, easy, and absolutely free. Elevate your browsing experience effortlessly.\n\nThe Guestbook Extension adheres to the highest user privacy principles and participates in the US-EU and US-Swiss Privacy Shield framework (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNXmAAO&status=Active)."
