Spaced repetition is a learning method where you repeat something at gradually increasing intervals. For example, after revisiting the word \"apple,\" you'll be quizzed on it the next day. Successfully answering the quiz means you'll see it again in two days, then four days later, and so on. Each correct answer doubles your review interval. This makes sense because you don't need to review a word daily if you already know it well. Learn more at https://ncase.me/remember/.\n\nJust type the word you want to learn, and we'll prepare a card with various meanings and quizzes. \n\nThis tool is primarily for me because I was tired of creating Anki cards for every new word I wanted to learn. Plus, sometimes, I just don't want to shift my focus from the text to Anki.\n\nCurrent features:\n- Option to remove specific meanings\n- Audio pronunciations (available for many words)\n- Sentences generated by ChatGPT\n- Definition and Sentence quizzes\n\nUpcoming:\n- Custom themes\n- Vim-style navigation\n- Comprehensive support for word lists\n\nI'll be pleased if you will find this useful."
