It depends on how site was built. I have fixed many issues but I guess that is not all.\n2.On some sites a limitation of the image data size is not working. Images loads fully. It happens when a server ignores specific parameter in the request.\n\n*** Release notes ***\n\n2.1\n- Fix showing on popup host without \".tld\".\n- All net request rules are session now to fixed order of execution.\n- Fix reload original image after the first load error.\n\n2.0\n- First major release.\n\nAll the best!"
