Spend more time with the first half.\n\n\"focus\" is the cleanest, most intuitive time-management extension on Chrome that doesn't try to be anything more than it should. Let it know with one keyboard shortcut that you need to get things done, and it will steer you away from a customizable set of websites that you know you can't be trusted with. Tailor which sites you'd like blocked, which it should warn you about, and which it should limit your time on, and then make the internet work for you, free of distractions.\n\n\nPRIVACY NOTICE:\nOn installation, the extension is granted permission to \"Read your browsing history.\" In practice, the extension is only aware of the page you're currently on. It can't look into the past, it has no memory, and it never trasmits data from your computer."
