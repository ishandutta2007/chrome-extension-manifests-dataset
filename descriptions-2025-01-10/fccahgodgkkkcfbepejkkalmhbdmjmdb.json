It also includes comments, but not attachments, images, or custom fields.\n\nYou can modify the following settings:\n\nâœ…  The popup can be hidden when the full page loads / when you mouse over it.\nâœ…  You can choose whether to show the popup only if there's a faster cache available, or to show it anyway. \nâœ…  Choose whether you want to see the description or comments first.\nâœ…  Also, you can choose whether to show older or newer comments first.\nâœ…  Cache size can be set.\nâœ…. Clear cache.\nâœ….
