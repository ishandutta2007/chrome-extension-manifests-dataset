It allows you to set the watching state in your Discord profile in Realtime on a big variety of webpages.\n\nWhat is the difference to PreMiD\n- No remote JavaScript execution or remote dependencies\n- Permission requested only for the active Presences\n- minimal content script and it only gets injected for the active Presence pages.\n\nWhy is the other extension and application needed?\nDiscord decided that you need an actual application to access the RPC API, there is currently no other way. The \"Discord Rich Presence\" extension does the communication to that application and provides an API for other Extensions to use. This way you don't need an separate application for every extension that wants to add Discord support.\n\nThe included presences are not created nor maintained by me.
