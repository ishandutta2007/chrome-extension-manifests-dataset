Like using image macros? Like chicken and waffles? Well, Awful Images helps you with nearly all of them!\n\nSet a URL in the preferences and use single [img-namehere] tags in your post, and they will automatically be converted to [img] tags before your post is submitted. You can even preview the result without having to retype tags! That way, you have time to rethink the terribly unfunny meme you're about to get banned over. It even works with [timg] tags! WOW!!!!\n\n\n(Awful Images is not associated in any way with the owners or operators of Something Awful.)"
