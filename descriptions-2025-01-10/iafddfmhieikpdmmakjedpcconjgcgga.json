The dashboard is directly embedded as a devtool panel (alongside the \"Styles\" and \"Computed\" panels) for quick access. Simply inspect an element and quickly make changes to it in the StarterCSS panel.\n\nWith StarterCSS, you can:\n✅ Add and customize layouts like flexboxes and grids, in addition to various visual attributes, in seconds\n✅ Visualize and test CSS code in isolated environments\n✅ Encounter fewer context switches from needing to look up CSS docs\n✅ Export created designs/layouts into CSS for copying into your local code editor\n\nTo access the extension, go to the \"Elements\" Tab in Chrome Devtools (Right Click > \"Inspect\" or Command+Shift+C). You should see a separate row with tabs like \"Styles\", \"Computed\", and \"Layout\". StarterCSS will be another panel here; if you've just downloaded the extension, you may have to click the \">>\" (see more) icon to see all panels. \n\nMore info at startercss.fun!\n\nIf you'd like to leave feedback, visit bit.ly/startercss-feedback."
