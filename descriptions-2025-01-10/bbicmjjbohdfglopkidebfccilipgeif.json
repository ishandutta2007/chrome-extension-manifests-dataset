The number of validation errors can be seen in the tool tip and the detail can be seen in the console tab of Chrome's developer tools.\n\nValidity also gives you the option to use your own installation of the W3C Validation Service.  (For more information on installing the W3C Validation Service see the documentation at http://validator.w3.org/docs/install.html).\n\n*** PLEASE DO NOT POST BUG REPORTS AND FEATURE REQUESTS IN THE REVIEWS ON THIS PAGE as they are unlikely to be actioned, use the GitHub issue system instead (https://github.com/renyard/validity/issues). ***\n\nChange Log:\n\n4.1.0 (05/11/2022)\n* Correctly label info messages.
