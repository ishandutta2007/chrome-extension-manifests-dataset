In order to get your horoscope, you first must go to the settings and input your sign as well as a special token from OpenAI. There is a link to get your token, which is totally free. Once that is set up then your horoscope gets updated every 24 hours! The cool thing is that it is totally unique to you; no 2 are alike. This was a fun project and I hope you enjoy!"
