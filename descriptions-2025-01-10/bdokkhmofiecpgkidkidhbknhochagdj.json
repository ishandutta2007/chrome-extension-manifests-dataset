The most famous one is the navigator.sendBeacon() API. Another method is to use the \"ping\" attribute for anchor elements. The last method is via a <meta> tag with a \"report-to\" URL. This addon, when enabled, can successfully block all ping requests. Toolbar icon changes color when you click on it. The red color is when the addon is active and the grey color is for the inactive state. \n\nWithin the add-on options page, there are several settings to adjust. You can choose which type of ping request to block via the first three options. Next, there is a console log error checkbox (to log blocked URLs to the browser's console). The last setting is for adding domains to be whitelisted. All entries should be comma-separated.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/ping-blocker.html)."
