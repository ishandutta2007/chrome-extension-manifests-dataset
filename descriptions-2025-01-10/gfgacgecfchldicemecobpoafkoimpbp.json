It can even bring you memes that you choose with a funny honk sound (if you select). It's the perfect companion that everyone needs! \n\n--- Web Blocker ---\nIn addition, this extension will block all websites that you choose, including sub-paths and keywords. For example, if you type, \"yay,\" it will block Google searches containing \"yay\" to help stop your addiction from spreading. If you want to still use something like youtube.com but not YouTube shorts, you can specify: \"youtube.com/shorts\" and it will work! It is that simple! Get started today on your journey to freedom from the clutches of social media and modern entertainment.\n\nNote 1: For the sound to play along with the memes, you must click or interact with the page or tab for it to work (result of Security Practice by Google).\n\nNote 2: For the memes to be shown, the goose has to be enabled.\n\nNote 3: Goose may not appear on all pages."
