Just take it Aside!\n\nKnown Issues:\nDoesn't work well with twitter.com and other websites that outright deny embedding. Please consider using this extension alongside https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe?hl=en-GB to get around these issues.\n\n⚠️When the extension popup is open, it intercepts webpage responses and removes the x-frame-options header which is designed to prevent clickjacking attacks. See https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking. We recommend you use this extension only with websites you trust to not clickjack you. This behaviour is reverted when the extension popup is closed.⚠️"
