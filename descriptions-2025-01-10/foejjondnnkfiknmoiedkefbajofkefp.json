The extension operates as a secure interface between the user's browser and the \"Fintoda Wallet\" mobile application, adding an extra layer of protection to the transaction process.\n\nWhen a Web Application initiates a transaction, Fintoda Wallet provides the user with a secure interface to review the transaction details before approving or rejecting it. This ensures that users have full visibility and control over their transactions, minimising the risk of unintended or malicious actions.\n\nFurthermore, Fintoda Wallet does not create or store user secrets, such as private keys or passwords. Instead, it leverages the existing security measures of the \"Fintoda Wallet\" mobile application, which is designed to securely manage and protect user credentials.\n\nBy separating the management of user secrets from the browser extension, Fintoda Wallet mitigates the risk of potential security vulnerabilities that may arise from storing sensitive information directly within the extension.\n\nOverall, Fintoda Wallet prioritises the security and privacy of its users by providing a secure gateway for communication, transparent transaction review, and leveraging established security practices to safeguard user credentials."
