Have you ever used Ctrl+F only to find that your search yields literally hundreds of results on the same page? If you answered “Yes” to either of the previous questions, then you will find BM25 Page Searcher useful!\n\nBM25 Page Searcher does exactly what its name implies: it performs BM25 search on the current webpage. Simply put, this allows users to prioritize the most relevant parts of a webpage over less relevant parts of a webpage. Relevance, in this case, is based on the user-inputted query."
