The problem is that most standups we’ve observed aren’t that great. People aren’t always prepared, they think on the spot, it’s not engaging, people tune out, random topics drain the clock, and there’s no record of daily progress. If any of this sounds familiar, try Spinach.io. \n\n🥬 Before standup\nEach person enters their updates in Spinach. Choose from default Yesterday, Today, Blocker categories or create your own!\n\nWriting helps you articulate thoughts more clearly. Standup is spent sharing context instead of trying to recall what you did yesterday.\n\nJira integration allows you to link your check-in to specific Jira tasks for deeper context.\n\n🥬 During standup\nSpinach rotates through each person so there’s no fumbling with “who goes next”.\n\nYou can see each person’s update and how long they’ve been speaking.\n\nHave something to discuss? Add it to Team Topics and Spinach will bring it up at the end to keep things moving.\n\n🥬 After standup\nSpinach keeps a summary of each standup and automatically posts to Slack and in the app. \n\n🥬 Async friendly\nIf you can’t join standup, your check-in can still be “in the meeting” even if you're not. Meeting free day? The team can skip live standup and just post updates in Slack. \n\nHow to get started. \nAdd the Chrome Extension. Open Google Meet. Click the Spinach icon in the lower right corner. Spinach will open directly in Google Meet. \n\nFeedback? Questions? Help? Email us anytime at hello@spinach.io"
