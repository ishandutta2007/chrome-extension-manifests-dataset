Lucid uses the power of the crowd to identify and report fake or misleading news.\n\nSimply download the extension and navigate to any news site like cnn.com or latimes.com. Then open the extension from your toolbar, sign up or log in, and then start rating news articles that you read.\n\nLucid uses your ratings on the truthfulness and political bias of articles and applies advanced algorithms to mine for insights from the crowd of users. In addition, when you navigate to a news article, the Lucid icon will provide you a quick view of what the rest of the Lucid community believes is the truthfulness and political bias of that article.\n\nFor more information, visit www.lucidrank.com"
