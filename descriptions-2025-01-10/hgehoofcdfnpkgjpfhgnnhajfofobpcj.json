But does it work? also yes.\n\nThis extension simply requests the pricing history information still present on the mobile API for whatever car you are looking at, and then adds it to a small informational panel you can toggle at the top of your screen, so that you can see all of the changes that have been made to a cars price.\n\nWritten in 30 minutes, so it cant be that hard. Carsales, do your job!\n\nThanks to tom43 for suggestion"
