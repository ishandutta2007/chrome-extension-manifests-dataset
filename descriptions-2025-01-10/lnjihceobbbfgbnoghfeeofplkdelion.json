The visibility that the exceptionBeautifier provides enables fast recognition of the stack-trace and analyzing the issue straight from the actual place of the \"crime\" - the browser. \nThe extension has few features making it interesting part of every tester tool-set. The user can automatically get copy of the exception output to clipboard or clear the input fields. One of the cool features also is the dark theme, allowing every user to completely align the extension appearance to their personal preferences."
