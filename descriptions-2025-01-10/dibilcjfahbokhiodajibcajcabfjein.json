This helps both end-users and developers understand why a web-page might be slow or experiencing problems. With the extension, you can quickly identify how long a page took to load, the size of the page in bytes, if any requests caused bottlenecks, the number of hosts that served content, and details about the type of files delivered.\n\nCatchpoint data can be used ad-hoc to share directly with IT support teams to help resolve incidents faster. IT teams can also use the Catchpoint portal for collecting data and reporting it in a comprehensive analytics and alerting platform to evaluate trends and see a holistic view of employee experience across entire departments or organizations."
