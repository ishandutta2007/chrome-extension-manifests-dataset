This can help reduce eye damage and overall give a more visually pleasing experience to the eye.\n \nThis Chrome extension is designed to automatically switch the current website to dark mode. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:\n\n1.Apply dark mode: This extension will automatically change the site you are on to dark mode. This can reduce eye strain and can help reduce power consumption.\n2.Invert colors: if the 1st step is unsuccessful, the extension will invert the site’s colors in such a way that it gives a similar effect.\n\nThis approach ensures that the website will either switch to dark mode or invert its colors to achieve a similar effect.\n-Put together by Felix Abraham and Samuel Abraham"
