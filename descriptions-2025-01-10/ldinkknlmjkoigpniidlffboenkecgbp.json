Many people use Tempo in Jira to track time, especially if it's a consultancy and you need to bill that time to someone! Some workplaces have flexible working arrangements. If you have flexible working hours, TempoFlex can let you know how much time you have worked above/below what you should have worked (according to your Tempo Administrator).\n\nTested with Jira Server only. Might work with Cloud, but unlikely since the Tempo APIs differ.\n\nTempoFlex doesn't ask for any credentials - it just requires that the user has already logged into Jira (as requests will use the same authentication cookies)."
