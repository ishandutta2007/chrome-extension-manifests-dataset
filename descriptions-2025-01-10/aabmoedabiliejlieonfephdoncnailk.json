This deprives the offending sites of clicks, views, and revenue.\nView source at: https://gitgud.io/SomeAnonGamer/GGBlocker\n\nFollow on twitter for update announcements and news: https://twitter.com/SomeAnonGamer\n\n===Permissions===\nRead and change all of the websites that you visit.\n\n==Explaination===\nAs explained here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest in order to catch every webrequest to check if it is going to a boycotted site, the extension needs to read each request. The write permission is because the extension writes helper buttons into Archive.is pages. If someone knows a way to reduce the permissions on GGBlocker, let me know.\n===Version 1.3.4 Patch===\nRepaired a Vivian replication glitch which occurred when multiple archive.is tabs were open. Thanks to @2CleverUsername for helping with this bug.\n\nAdded http://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/ to the default filter list.\n\nRemoved http://childsplaycharity.com from the default filter list.\n\nNOTE: Changes to the default filter list will only affect new installs. I don't want to screw up existing customizations by forcing the new list.\n\n===Version 1.3.3 Patch===\nRemoved 4chan.org from default filter list.\n\nTweaked tool button sizes to compensate for users running resolutions < 1080p. IT'S *CURRENT_YEAR* FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! \n===Version 1.3.2 Update===\n\nSwitched default archive url to archive.is.\n\nAll archive.is pages now have a \"Fetch Fresher Page\" link.\n\nAdded the ability to delete filters. (finally).\n\nAdded basic update message functionality.\n\nAdded Tool Section inside of \"Edit Filters\".\n\nAdded tool for deleting all filters.\n\nAdded tool for exporting list of filters.\n\nAdded tool for importing list of filters.\n\nAdded tool for reseting filter list to default.\n\nAdded two bad jokes which I think are hilarious at this time of night.\n===Version 1.2.1 Patch===\nFixed a time-related bug that affected late night and early morning users.\n\n===Version 1.2 Update===\n\nThe extension now pulls the most recent copy of a blocked page from Archive.today, to the local hour.\n\nIndividual items on the boycott list can enabled or disabled according to your personal preferences.\n\nNew items can be added to your personal boycott list.\n\nAdded a quick archive button to save any webpage to archive.today or tweetsaver.\n\nAdded a new button that quickly enables or disables the extension.\n\nUpdated how the extension injects the \"Add To Archive\" button into pages for better compatibility with archive.today.\n\n===Version 1.1 Update===\nIf a blocked webpage is not in archive.today, GGBlocker will now dynamically inject an \"Add to Archive\" button into the archive.today error page. This will should help to increase the archive.today coverage."
