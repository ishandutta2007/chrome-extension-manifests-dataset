Will try to add a nice feature that possibly will be compatible with original Octotree-v3 version.\n\nRecommendations: \nTo enable icons in the tree-view install additional extension:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-icon-for-github-and/ficfmibkjjnpogdcfhfokmihanoldbfe\n\nTo enable dark theme you need to install a compatible third party extension and my preference is:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-dark-theme/odkdlljoangmamjilkamahebpkgpeacp/"
