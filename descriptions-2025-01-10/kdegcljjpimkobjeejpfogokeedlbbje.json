It's because the text in books doesn't move! \nWhen you scroll the text you're reading, you're giving your eyes a hard time.\nSnap Scroll brings the book experience to the screen by replacing that continuous movement with quick and predictable hops.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nKeep your hands off that scroll wheel! When you finish reading a paragraph, just click directly below it using the middle mouse button (or the left and right button at the same time) to instantly bring the next paragraph to the top - like a virtual page turn! Because there is no interruption you'll be less distracted.\n\nGive it a try and see your focus improve!"
