Township is a city-building and farming game where players can create and manage their own town. Cash, in this context, is a premium currency that can be used for various purposes within the game. Here's what cash is typically used for:\n\nSpeeding Up Processes: Cash can be used to speed up the production of goods in factories or the growth of crops on farms. This allows you to progress more quickly in the game.\n\nPurchasing Premium Decorations: You can use cash to buy special premium decorations for your town, which can enhance its appearance.\n\nCompleting Orders: In the helicopter pad and train station, you can spend cash to instantly fill orders or send products, saving you time and resources.\n\nExpanding Storage: Cash can be used to increase your storage capacity, allowing you to store more items and materials.\n\nBuying Special Items: Some unique items and boosts can be purchased with cash, giving you advantages in various aspects of the game.\n\nCash in Township is typically obtained through in-app purchases using real money, although there are occasional opportunities to earn small amounts of cash through in-game events and achievements. Players can choose whether or not to spend real money on cash in the game, depending on their preferences and playstyle."
