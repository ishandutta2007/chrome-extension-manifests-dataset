The original game was created by Sebastien Gabriel in 2014. Also called T-rex Runner, this game features a tiny dinosaur that runs through a desert.\n\nMake the Dino jump over hurdles by hitting the spacebar button or using the up-arrow key.\n\nThe more distance t-rex covers without hitting hurdles, the more will be the score. The moment dinosaur hits any obstacle, the game gets over. \n\nInstall the Chrome Dino game extension and start playing the game now! You can share your score with friends and challenge them to beat you."
