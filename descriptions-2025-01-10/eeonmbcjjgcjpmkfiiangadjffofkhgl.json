The plugin counts your contributions (pushes, issues, etc) and shows how active you've been today on every web page you visit. The idea is to encourage you to do more instead of pointless web surfing.\n\nSuitable for programmers, technical writers, QA engineers and anyone, who use GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket every day. \n\nContribute more for the greater good! Be a progaholic!\n\nMore information is here: https://github.com/dsavenko/progaholic\n\nPlease, send me feedback, like bug reports, feature requests or pull requests! The best way would be by filing issues on GitHub. You can also mail me at ds@dsavenko.com."
