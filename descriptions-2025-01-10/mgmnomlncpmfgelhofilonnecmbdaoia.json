With this extension, you can send links to the Brave browser without the hassle of manually copying and pasting links. Additionally, it can open all tabs in the destination browser with a single click. You can also close the tab opened in the destination browser if prefer so.\n\nIf Brave is already running, the link opens in a new tab; however, if Brave is not running, a new instance is launched, then the link is directed there.\n\nRemarks:\n1. To enable this extension to open links in the Brave browser, you'll need to install a native client. Installation instructions are provided upon requesting link opening. For visual guidance, there are two short video tutorials available in the screenshot section, covering installation steps for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.\n\n2. Currently, the native client only supports macOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems. Support for other operating systems is not available at this time."
