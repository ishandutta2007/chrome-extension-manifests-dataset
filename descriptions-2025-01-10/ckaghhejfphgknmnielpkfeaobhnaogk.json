When you copy with Code++, it adds a ton of context about the code and where it came from to your clipboard!\n\nUsers can even customize which information is added. In the settings menu you can toggle which of the following information is added: Title, Description, Tags, Links, People, Sensitive Information (i.e. API keys, secrets).\n\nGetting Started:\n1. Install the Code++ Extension\n2. [Optional] Pin the extension in your Chrome toolbar\n3. Select code you find on stackoverflow.com or your favorite coding site, then either Right-Click and select \"Copy with Code++ Context\"  or use the keyboard shortcut \"ALT + SHIFT + C\" (Windows/Linux) or \"OPTION + SHIFT + C\" (MacOS)\n4. Paste your code in Slack, in your IDE, in your favorite snippet application, send it to your friends or your grandma who doesn't understand what code is but is happy to brag about how good you are with computers\n\nMade with ❤️ by the Pieces team"
