Amazon AppStream deploys and renders your application on AWS infrastructure and streams the output to mass-market devices, such as personal computers, tablets, and mobile phones. Because your application is running in the cloud, it can scale to handle vast computational and storage needs, regardless of the devices your customers are using. You can choose to stream either all or parts of your application from the cloud. Amazon AppStream enables use cases for applications that wouldn’t be possible running natively on mass-market devices. Using Amazon AppStream, your applications are no longer constrained by the hardware in your customer’s hands.\n\nAmazon AppStream includes a SDK that currently supports streaming applications from Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 to devices running FireOS, Android, iOS, Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows, and now Chromebooks and Chrome Web Browsers."
