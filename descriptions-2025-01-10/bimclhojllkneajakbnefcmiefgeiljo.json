However, any comments on those files will be removed when the copies are made. \n\nThis extension will search through any Docs or Slides attachments and copy the comments from your original to the student copies. This can be really useful for giving more detailed instructions alongside your template Doc or Slides without interfering with the workspace or final result.\n\nAll comments appear with your name at the time the copies are made."
