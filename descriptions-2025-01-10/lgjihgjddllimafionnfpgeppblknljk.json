Now you can use the standard emoji shortcodes like :joy: üòÇ, :poop: üí©, :eggplant: üçÜ, and etc. You can find an exhaustive list of emoji shortcodes here http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/. Some of them are hard to remember, so a helpful toolbox with suggestions will also appear on the bottom right corner of your screen when you begin typing shortcodes. Simple, clutter-free, and easy to use!\n\nTotally free, and totally ad-free. Doesn't track your conversations.\n\n*Supports Facebook chat, Whatsapp Web, Gmail, and common input boxes\n** Let me know if you find an application that doesn't work that you would like to see support added for!\n\nThanks!"
