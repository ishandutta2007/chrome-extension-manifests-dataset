This extension allows you to selectively hide each of these sections and even block access to any of these websites.\n\nNote: Extensions do not access history and WE DO NOT send/store any browser related information.\n--------------------------------------------------- ---\nExtension developed by: ductri.it.kt@gmail.com"
