Need to keep an eye on queue but have work to do? ONX RP Alerts is here to help! This browser extension will allow you to see your position in realtime via the badge notification as well as in-window no matter what tab you're on. You can also set alerts for certain positions in queue, which will be pushed to your desktop on both Windows and macOS!\n\nThis is the first iteration of this extension and I hope to continue to bring you updates as I receive feedback. I made this sitting in queue, so if I can use it you can too!"
