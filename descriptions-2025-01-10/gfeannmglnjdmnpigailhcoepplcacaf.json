This behavior causes me huge problems like no ability to search and navigate between tabs, Chrome memory consumption raises and many other productivity issues.\nOver the years I've tried almost any tab extension out there, just name it - I tried it. Almost any extension had a feature I like but there is no extension where I can get all the benefits I am looking for.
