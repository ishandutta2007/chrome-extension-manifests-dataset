This is the browser extension of Flier.io for saving online articles with one click.\n\nFlier.io helps you rethink newsletter you subscribed and articles you saved to read later. It is not your job to read everything that hits your inbox, even if they are explicitly saved by the past you.\n\nInstead, let these articles form a newsfeed that made by your own choices. You can read them, skim them, or whatever you like. Flier.io helps you track what's the next article you can read without making reading feels like a job."
