Constantly working in the background, analysing data, finding rewards, and providing information on the products your looking at. All for greater convenience to the customer, as we make sustainable shopping effortless. Harvestâ€™s main goal is to improve your sustainable buying experience and the efficiency of businesses. Harvest saves the world by providing consumers information about how the product is made, advises reducing waste, and promotes sustainable businesses. Informing the consumer about their products gives them the power to contribute to businesses that have sustainable values. As more consumers make informed decisions, businesses are also challenged to develop more sustainable practices. The added bonus for the consumer to make these decisions is by offering other companies with similar products they could buy with additional discounts for using Harvest. The app incentives sponsorship, partnerships, and promotional deals with sustainable brands for funding."
