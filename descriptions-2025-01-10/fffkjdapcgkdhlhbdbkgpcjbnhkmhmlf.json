Recruiters and sales professionals can now simply find candidates or prospects on LinkedIn and click once on the app. RemotelyMe uses AI and neuroscience to analyze a contact’s information and go far beyond outdated personality apps by determining attributes, soft skills, and communication preferences. The RemotelyMe app pre-assesses and qualifies contacts against preferences and requirements for your Ideal Customer or Candidate Profiles (ICPs) to provide scores and analysis details. The app is highly accurate even for contacts with minimal LinkedIn information. The app then uses LinkedIn data, such as experience, skills, and interests, as well as neuroscience profile information including keywords, preferences, and message tone to automatically prompt ChatGPT to write highly personalized emails, messages, or phone scripts in the contact’s native language. Personalized Communications Playbooks are also created to help you build candidate or customer trust. Users can also leverage RemotelyMe’s exclusive LinkedIn Leaders Forum group to entice contacts to respond and take immediate action.\n\n“This groundbreaking app with automated ChatGPT personalized prompts can save hundreds of hours analyzing contacts and personalizing messages.” –VP Talent Acquisition, Talend/Qlik\n\n“RemotelyMe’s app is way better than personality apps and will save us thousands on LinkedIn InMail and licensing costs.” --VP, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate"
