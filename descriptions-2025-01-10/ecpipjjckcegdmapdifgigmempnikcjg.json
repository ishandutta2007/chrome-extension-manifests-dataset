You can use the extension to save links from your tabs and tab groups, articles, quotes from websites, and even RSS and Atom feeds.\n\n★ Privacy\n\nThis extension has a detailed privacy policy which you can read on our website, but the gist of it is that your private data won't be sent to our servers unless you log in to our website. You can absolutely use this extension 100% locally, and even without an internet connection.\n\n★ Save tabs and tab groups\n\nSaving tabs and tab groups is the primary feature of this extension. The extension can save and reopen any of your tabs and tab groups. You can also choose to close the tabs after saving. The extension will remember the names and colors of your tab groups as well as the links they contain, and restore them appropriately.\n\nWhile choosing which tabs to save, you can select the current tab, everything except the current tab, everything to the left or right of the current tab, tabs you've highlighted, or just specific tabs you've selected within the extension. The extension allows you to choose tabs from specific windows as well.\n\n★ Save articles\n\nThis extension empowers you to save articles from the web. The extension contains a polished article reader which not only allows you to read content from the web, but to edit that content. The article editor is a full rich text editor with the ability to add notes, highlight text, and apply complex text styling. You can apply all of the traditional text styles like bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough, as well as more complex styling constructs like lists, block quotes, links, and headers. If you've saved an article which contains source code, the article reader will even apply syntax highlighting with support for most popular programming languages!\n\n★ Save quotes\n\nThe extension can save quotes from websites. Just select a passage of text on a website, right click, and then click 'Save Selected Text'. The extension will save the selected text, as well as a text fragment link. When you click the link in a browser that supports text fragments, it'll take you to the original website and visually highlight the text you saved.\n\n★ Feeds\n\nThe extension can notify you if it finds an RSS or Atom feed on the current page (by updating the extension's icon with the number of feeds found). If you save a feed, the extension will fetch new links from the feed in the background, and you can choose to save or delete any of the fetched links.\n\n★ Sort by site, tag, or time period\n\nWant to find all of your saved data from a specific site, or annotated with a specific tag? This extension allows you to filter your data based on specific sites and tags, as well as view your data chronologically in a calendar view.\n\n★ Search\n\nThe extension supports fast full-text search, which you can access quickly from within the extension popup with a keyboard shortcut.\n\n★ Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nYou can open the extension by holding Command + Shift + O on a Mac or Ctrl + Shift + O in any other operating system. Once the extension popup is open, you can use shortcuts to:\n\n- Save All Tabs\n- Save the Current Tab\n- Save Everything Except the Current Tab\n- Save an Article\n- Search\n- Open the extension popup in a new tab\n- Toggle Privacy Mode\n\n★ Sharing\n\nSecurely and privately share your data with friends! Click the settings icon next to any collection of saved data to share that collection with others. The extension will generate a shareable url which compresses the data and appends it to the hash portion of the url. When you (or someone else) open the link in your browser, the page's code will decompress the data and present it to you. Data stored in the hash portion of a url is never sent to external servers by web browsers, which means only the people you share the link with will ever have access to that data."
