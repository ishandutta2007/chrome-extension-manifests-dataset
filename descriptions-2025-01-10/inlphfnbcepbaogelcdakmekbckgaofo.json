Unblock over 800+ global streaming services from across the world from your country.\n\n\nWhy choose NetflixVPN?\n\n    • Residential VPN makes the connection look like a standard home user.\nMost VPNs use commercial IP addresses that are normally allocated to datacentres.This actually makes them much easier to detect, if a website wants to block or restrict access to VPNs then checking the classification of the IP address is an easy option. Fortunately most of the broadcasting networks don’t use this method, with the exception of Netflix. At one point they blocked access to all non-residential IP addresses, which meant that none of the popular VPNs would work with the site. This does cause other issues though and currently Netflix have reversed this policy.We will help you fix proxy error for streaming.\n\n    • Provide access to libraries of different countries.\nNetflixvpn currently Unblocks 20 NETFLIX LIBRARIES as well as 800+ streaming sites such as Hulu, BBC iPlayer, DisneyPlus, & so much more!\n\n    • Unblock any website and stay secure\nWe not only help you unblock streaming sites, but also bypass websites blocked or censored in your country, company and school. \n\n\nPackages:\nBecome a Premium user in order to get the applications for all devices including PC, Mac, iOS and Android mobile phones, routers etc., using different layers of VPN security protocols(PPTP/L2TP/SSTP/OPENVPN) and get access to more server locations around the world.\n   * Premium: Residential IP VPN, Unblocks 23 NETFLIX LIBRARIES\n        ✔ 1 month: $5\n        ✔ 6 months: $25\n        ✔ 1 year: $40\n        ✔ 2 years: $60\n\nRemember 99% of VPN or proxy extensions you see advertised – with a datacenter IP address is much easier to detect than a residential VPN. Mainly because they’re much easier to obtain.\n\n\nWeb: https://www.netflixvpn.com\nSupport: admin@netflixvpn.com\n\nNetflixVPN keeps no connection logs and no activity logs, so no user can be matched to specific network activity or behavior.  https://www.netflixvpn.com/article/Privacy_Policy\n\nBy using this add-on, you agree to the Terms & Conditions available at https://netflixvpn.com/main/tos\n\nPlease rate as a 5 star and leave feedback, We are continuously improving the extension based on user feedback."
