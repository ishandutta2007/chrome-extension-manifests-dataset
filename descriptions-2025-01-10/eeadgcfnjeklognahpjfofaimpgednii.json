If that sounds like you then YOU LACK DISCIPLINE! and you need the help of your wise mentor, Master Foo Bar.\n\nAs you traverse the web, you may find a site that you want to block to keep you from temptation while you work. If so, just click on the You Lack Discipline! extension in the corner or Google Chrome and ADD the current site to your blocked list. You can then edit that list by clicking EDIT in the extension popup. When You Lack Discipline! is ON, it will redirect you to a reminder page when you try to navigate to one of the sites on your list. \n\nIf you are done with your work, you can turn the power off by clicking on the GREEN button in the bottom right corner of the popup. If the button is green that means it is on and you need to stay disciplined! But if it is red, then you are free to waste time to your heart's content.\n\n\nCopyright info:\nbackground image from: http://imageshack.com/i/n9black1926j"
