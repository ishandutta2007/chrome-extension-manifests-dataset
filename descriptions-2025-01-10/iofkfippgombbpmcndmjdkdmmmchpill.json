It could contain lots of mistakes.\n- 🛡️ No third-party server needed\n- 🛡️ No confliction with Youtube web player's CC\n- 🛡️ Maximum safety:\n  - No injection if you don't click the toolbar button.\n  - Minimum permission required.\n  - UI on browser toolbar, inject as less as possible to web\n\n[More of my addons]  \n  https://garywill.github.io \n\nYoutube has videos that provide subtitles (CC, closed captions) in different languages, but will not display more than one simultaneously on itself's web player. Why not display several at the same time? Why not? \n\nNothing fancy, this is a browser addon that works! **Watch with two subtitles on. Even more, three, four, five ... Simultaneously.**\n\nDisplay as many as you like! Different languages, translated, auto-generated ...\n\nUseful for leaning foreign languages.\n\n## Testing videos\n\n1. [Video with only auto-generated English CC] \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn5BkviAyvQ \n\n2.
