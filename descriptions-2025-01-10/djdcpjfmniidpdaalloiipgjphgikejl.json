If a user tries to open a tab when he's already at his tab limit, the newly opened tab automatically closes. This extension will be useful to users who find themselves opening more tabs than they need to. It will also helps users get less distracted from the task at hand by finding themselves opening unnecessary tabs. It is kind of a nudge for them to remind themselves that, hey, they need to stay focused on the task at hand. The user can adjust the number of maximum tabs they want open at any point in time."
