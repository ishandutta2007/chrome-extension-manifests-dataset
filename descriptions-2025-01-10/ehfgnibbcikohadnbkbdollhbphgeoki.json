The Basic Parse only captures the current position for quick data gathering, whilst the Full Parse enables you to create a record with multiple positions, qualifications and categories.\n\nVersion 1.0.17 adds the ability in Basic parse to set Progress Notes and Progress status when creating People and adding them as a Candidate to an Assignment.  \n\nVersion 1.0.18 fixes an issue where \"Null\" can be added to Progress Notes when basic parsing in certain workflows. \n\nVersion 1.0.19 fixes an issue where the parser was stuck in a loading state when parsing some CVs.\n\nVersion 1.1.0 updated the extension framework for stability & security improvements"
