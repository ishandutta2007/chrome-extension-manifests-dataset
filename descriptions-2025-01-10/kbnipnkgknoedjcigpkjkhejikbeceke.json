Here’s how it would work:\n\n1) Monitor Competitor Product Launches:\n The tool can track when new products are added to other Shopify stores (competitors). This helps you stay updated on their latest launches and trends.\n\n2) Identify Hot Products Early:\n\nBy seeing when new products are added to competitors’ stores, you can quickly identify trends and popular items, allowing you to react faster.\n\n3) Launch Timing Insights:\n\nIt gives you an idea of the frequency and timing of your competitors’ product launches. This information can help you plan your own launches strategically, avoiding busy periods when many competitors are launching.\n\n4) Competitor Analysis:\n\nThe tracker could show you how long a product has been listed in your competitors' stores, helping you understand which items might be older or not performing well."
