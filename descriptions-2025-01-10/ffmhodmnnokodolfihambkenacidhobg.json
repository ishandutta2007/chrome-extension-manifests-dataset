Now the thing about the joke, the male and female thing earlier, that's often a joke that if you call a male a female like \"you're a girl\" or \"a sissy\", because you are suggesting that by a man taking on female attributes that they are somewhat less, somewhat weak. This is inherited in a patriarchy of any kind but someone wrote something really interesting about this and that's Judith Butler, and in her book 'Gender Trouble' she talks about the idea of ‘gender performativity’, that all culture, that we live in, in the western world, permeates this idea of specific roles that men and women must have that are not biologically given to us, but are culturally given to us. For example, the things you might drink; a man has a pint of lager and a woman has a glass of wine. These things aren't biologically encoded into our genes, they're just cultural."
