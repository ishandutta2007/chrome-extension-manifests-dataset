To contribute to database you need to select Madiator Finder API.\nIf you want to be included in leaderboard you need to generate own profile from extension. It will generate public/private key that will allow to assign points based on your contribution (every channel/video you find count as one point). If you do not generate profile the api won't be counting points but will save videos you find to database (anonymous). Our API do not collect any informations like IP and everyone can purge their data using button on extension popup.\n\n\nDisclaimer!\nThis plugin is not made by LBRY Inc"
