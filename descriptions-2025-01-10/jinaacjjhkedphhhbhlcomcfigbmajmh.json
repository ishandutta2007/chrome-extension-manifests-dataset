It is as simple as clicking on a bunch of numbers to complete an equation. Difficulty levels include \"Easy\" which is just filling up 3 numbers; \"Moderate\" - to fill up 4 numbers; \"Difficult\" - to fill up 5; and \"Extreme\" which may get you thinking for a while.\n\nMathfillin's order of operation is MDAS. Meaning, Multiplication should start first, then division, then Addition followed by Subtraction.\n\nEnjoy!"
