It also adds approximate journey times.\n\n* the distance shown on member profile pages is changed to be the distance by road and also shows journey time\n* profile search results add text below the avatar with distance and travel time\n* the search results page has options added to sort by distance and duration in addition to the default ordering\n* casting call search results and the detailed casting call view show travel distances\n* results over the chosen search radius are dimmed to make it easy to ignore at a glance. They are undimmed if hovered over.\n* a glitch with the first page of recent images is addressed and the date range of images is shown\n\nNote: While travel distances are likely to be pretty accurate and tend to agree with Google mapping, journey times may be optimistic as they do not take into account traffic flow."
