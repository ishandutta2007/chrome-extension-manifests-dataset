If an attacker were to craft a request toward a server that performs an action, the request would contain any identifying cookies you have. As pointed out in academic literature, this can be used to empty bank accounts, change passwords, or anything in between.\n\nThis extension attempts to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery by stripping cookies from any (non-GET) request that does not follow the same-origin policy. In this way, normal browsing remains uninterrupted while any possible CRSF attacks are blocked!\n\nThe extension is easily disabled and contains a small report of all requests which had cookies stripped. \n\nThis extension is open source and the source code is viewable at https://github.com/brandonio21/no-csrf\n\nThis extension is based on a similar extension by avlidienbrunn"
