If it doesn't work for you, it could be a OS related bug. I am using macOS and before I make claims, I thoroughly test it through all major browsers.\n\nüöÄ Features\nThe only extension on the market with functionalities that no other extension in this category possess.‚Ä®\n\n‚ñ∏ Blazingly fast ‚Äî injection script that manipulates the video is written in plain JavaScript, has tiny footprint and is very fast.\n‚ñ∏ Limitless platforms ‚Äî not limited to any specific video streaming platform. Aims to work everywhere, including embeddable videos.\n‚ñ∏ Minimal interface ‚Äî thoughtful design that doesn't get in your way, but provides you with all the necessary options to get the experience you deserve.\n‚ñ∏ Appearance ‚Äî automatically applies the appearance that you are using as your system preference. If your system is in dark mode, the extension will be too.\n‚ñ∏ Cross-browser ‚Äî available for all major browsers and tested on Chrome & Firefox. It works in all Chromium based browsers as well.\n‚ñ∏ Internationalization ‚Äî supports handful of languages, but aiming to support all major languages with the help of the community.\n‚ñ∏ Keyboard shortcuts ‚Äî customizable within the browser to avoid conflicts with other extensions. Support for activity and mode toggling.\n‚ñ∏ Magic touch ‚Äî Toggle between modes with built-in pinch inwards/outwards on touch screens, trackpads with multi-touch gestures and mouse wheel while holding CTRL key.\n\nüß† Purpose\nGain power over the video in fullscreen mode. Primarily developed for 34\" ultra-wide screens, but powerful for other smaller or larger screens too. I am currently using it on my Macbook Pro 14\" to get rid of all black bars (horizontally and vertically), previously I used it on ultra-wide monitor.\n\nüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage\nRelatively easy to use, but powerful at its core. Comes with handful of options within small interface and keyboard shortcuts.\n\n‚ñ∏ Interface ‚Äì Popup interface that you usually open by clicking on the extension icon, has built-in shortcut to toggle it for an easy access at your fingertips.\n‚ñ∏ Activity ‚Äì This option will be enabled by default. To deactivate the features it applies to the video element, toggle the switch.\n‚ñ∏ Mode ‚Äì Upscale mode will be enabled by default and only one mode can be active at a time.\n‚ñ∏ Scale ‚Äì It works simultaneously with the active mode and can scale the video up or down. The default value is 1 and it means that no scaling will be applied.\n\nü§û Claims\nIt is working on all globally popular video streaming platforms. Including all embeddable videos. If it doesn't work somewhere, open up a ticket on the support link that's provided (Github Issues) and I'll try to fix it for you and everybody else.",
