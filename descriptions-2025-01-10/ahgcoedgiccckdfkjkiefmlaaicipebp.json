You have open tabs and windows on multiple synced devices (for example multiple smartphones or multiple laptops)\n2. You need a specific tab on your laptop, or you want to consolidate all your tabs on your laptop\n3. ...and most importantly you don't want to copy URLs manually from your device to laptop or avoid using open tabs on your other devices\n\n* How does it work? ü§ì\n1. Click on the extension icon\n2. The extension will search all your synced devices for the tabs and windows in the background\n3. For each device, it will open a new Chrome window on your laptop with all the tabs of that device.\n\n\nStill in active development, please find more info: https://github.com/FraDiBen/OpenAllTabs"
