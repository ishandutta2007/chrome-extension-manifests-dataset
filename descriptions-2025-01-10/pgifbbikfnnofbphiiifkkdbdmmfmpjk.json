The process is intuitive â€“ click anywhere on the document to select elements, use the keyboard shortcuts (up/down or w/d for hierarchy, left/right or a/d for siblings) to navigate and choose precisely. Once your selection is finalized, click the 'Take Snapshot' button conveniently located at the top left corner. This action stores your current selection in memory. To accommodate different media breakpoints, simply resize your browser and click 'Take Snapshot' again to capture the layout at that specific width. When you've completed your selection process, press 'esc' to finish.\n\n**Destination Tab: Oxygen Builder or Bricks Builder**\nSwitch to the tab containing your Oxygen Builder or Bricks Builder dashboard within your WordPress website. Click the Nimbufy icon on the browser toolbar to open a popup that allows you to organize the snapshots you took in the source stage into destination media breakpoints.\n\nWhen you hit 'Import into Oxygen' or 'Import into Bricks,' Nimbufy securely sends the snapshot data to its server, where it's transformed into a format compatible with your builder. Once the conversion is complete, the Nimbufy extension efficiently imports the data into Oxygen Builder or Bricks Builder. Please note that a valid registration or Nimbufy credits or Subscription to either Nimbufy service or WordPress plugins corresponding to either Oxygen Builder or Bricks Builder, are required for this processing.\n\nFor more details on Nimbufy, visit [Nimbufy's official website](https://nimbufy.com).\n\nIt's important to note that Nimbufy focuses solely on HTML and CSS, without reverse engineering any JavaScript on the target website. This ensures a seamless and efficient conversion process while maintaining the integrity of your design elements."
