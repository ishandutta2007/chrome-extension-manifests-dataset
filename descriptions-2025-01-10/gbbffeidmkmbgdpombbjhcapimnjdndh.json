Also, this is handy for investors seeking terrains suitable for their needs. \n\nNote:\nThe information provided by the polyGIS extension is unenforced by Romanian laws. All the information supplied is only for consulting reasons. For legally enforced documents, please refer to the nearest city hall or ANCPI, following procedures described by the Romanian laws.\nThe developer of this extension is not responsible for any damage created by the misuse of this application.\nANCPI or the Romanian State has the legal right to restrict access to this extension by referring to its developer."
