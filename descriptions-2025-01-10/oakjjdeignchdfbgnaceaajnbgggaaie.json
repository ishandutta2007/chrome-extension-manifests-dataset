But then we come across those useful videos that are in a different language, have irrelevant title or have no tags. Adding these videos to playlists and bookmarks wont help once there too many such videos . How does one recall such videos, what will you search for? Here's where tubeSeek comes in.\n\nTo use the extension , simply click on the tS icon when you are on a youtube video page and click Open on tubeSeek to start tagging.\n\ntubeSeek offers the following features to its users to recollect videos faster:\n1. Blazing fast searches : Responsive , search as you type \n2. Private tags : Private tags as against the public ones are only visible to the tag owner. With private tags you get to add twice the number of tags per video than public tags.\n3.

Search filters : You don't have to type your search query again and again, you store your search query and tubeSeek will display the latest videos of that search query."
