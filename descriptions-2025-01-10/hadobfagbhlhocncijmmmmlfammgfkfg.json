It adds visible labels to all HTML heading tags (h1 to h6) on the active tab, assigns background colours to each level of heading, and flags any headings that are out of sequential order as defined by W3C.\n\nThis extension is designed to help you quickly identify and navigate the heading structure of any webpage you are working on. By labelling each heading tag with its level (H1, H2, etc.), you can easily see how the headings are organised and make sure that they are in the correct order. The background colours for each heading level also make it easier to visually distinguish between different sections of the page.\n\nIf a heading is out of order, the extension will flag it with the word \"No\" and a red background colour in the pop up. This can help you quickly identify and fix any structural issues with the page.\n\nHeadLands also uses \"Phrase Focus\" for the first H1 on the page. For Product page or blog posts it should be close to 100% \n\nHeadLands is easy to use and requires no setup or configuration. Simply install the extension and it will automatically label all heading tags on the active tab. You can also toggle the labelling on and off using the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.\n\nIf you're a web developer or designer who wants to quickly and easily understand the heading structure of any webpage, the Headings Labeller extension is an essential tool that you won't want to be without. Try it today!"
