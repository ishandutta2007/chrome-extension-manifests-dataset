Cross your fingers.\n\nA free simple straight forward TTS extension with multiple voices, a right click menu, and a hotkey trigger. Just select your text and off you go! \n\nI was unhappy by all the free TTS options out there.  I made this for myself to help read emails and work documentation to me.  Hopefully someone else finds it useful too.\n\n1.) Is it ugly - Yes, everything about it\n2.) Was this made by an artist with no programming experience - Yes, I went to art school and work in the game dev industry.  This was mostly made by ChatGPT/Claude2.\n3.) Has it been fully QA tested?  Does it work? - No, and maybe...it works on my machine.\n\nThings I want to add:\n1. A pause and stop button - right now if you ask it to read a big doc the only way to stop it is to have it start reading another selection.\n2. Customizable hotkey\n\nFeedback is always welcome!\n\nI will probably post the code up on github for others to improve/giggle at."
