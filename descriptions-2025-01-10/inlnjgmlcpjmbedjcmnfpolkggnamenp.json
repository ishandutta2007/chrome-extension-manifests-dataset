The strong security is based on the use of a smartcard reader or a security token at client pc which is connected with a web-application by TRAVIC-Sign. \n\nDigital signatures applied by the smartcard reader protect order data – e.g. payments, inventory changes or product sales – by means of an advanced signature that is linked to a person. Signed data can be assigned reliably to a specific person by the bank. Additionally the bank itself is able to sign the order date which can be checked by TRAVIC-Sign. By verifying the signature combined with the hardened smartcard reader attackers are not able to manipulate the communication.\n\nThe TRAVIC-Sign extension available for download here is one part of the TRAVIC-Sign product. The second part is the installer which enables the browser to communicate with the smartcard reader. In order to work properly TRAVIC-Sign must be integrated in an existing web-application. The screenshots in the overview illustrate the portal TRAVIC-Port that uses TRAVIC-Sign for signing orders.
