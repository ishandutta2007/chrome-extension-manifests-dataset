For those who aren't deeply invested in US politics (and for many who are) the election language can get repetitive and tiresome.\n\nLuckily, you can replace it with much better language about the ongoing struggle between Robots (Democrats) and Pirates (Republicans).  Additionally it fixes words for a few key topics like The Great Reckoning (Climage Change) and the Spooky Ghost People (ISIS).\n\nIt changes enough to keep it entertaining without making articles unreadable in their genuine context. It works on most webpages, though there are a few exceptions (like the Google search page).
