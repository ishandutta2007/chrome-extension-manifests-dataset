Update to version 1.0.6 and reset default filter options to implement fix.\n\nWeb Guardian is a real time web content filtering solution.  It finds and blocks obscene words and restricts whole pages according to content concentration.\n\nWeb Guardian offers complete filtering flexibility by allowing users to customize a domain white-list, domain black-list, and list of obscene words.  In the list of obscene words, each blocked word is assigned a user chosen weight.  These weights are summed to determine whether or not a site should be restricted.\n\nWeb Guardian also does all of this in real time, meaning dynamically updated content (such as scrolling Facebook) is no problem.  New words are detected and blocked as they come into existence.\n\nWeb Guardian also features password restricted options so that changes may only be made by authorized personnel."
