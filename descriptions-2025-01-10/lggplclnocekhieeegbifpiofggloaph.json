Long messages can take several minutes, during which users might switch tabs or step away, often returning to find the message unfinished and needing manual clicks.

Optionally, it can alert users through sound or notification when the message is fully generated, making it ideal for developers and anyone relying on ChatGPT for lengthy responses.\n\n🤖 Automatically detects and clicks 'Continue generating' when ChatGPT reaches its token limit during long message generation.\n⏱️ Keeps ChatGPT active: Ensures continuous message generation, even with multiple auto-clicks.\n🛠️ Convenience: Allows users to be away or working in another tab while ChatGPT continues uninterrupted.\n🔔 Optionally plays sounds for 'Continue generating' and generation completion.\n📢 Optionally receive a system notification when generation is complete.\n🌐 Up-to-Date: Compatible with the latest ChatGPT and all languages.\n\n🔴 Official extension website: https://kgniewek.com/project/2\n\n⚙️ Popup Settings\n➊ Enable 'Continue generating' click\n➋ Enable click sound effect\n➌ Completed generation sound effect\n➍ Completed generation notification\n\n⭐ If you find this extension helpful, please rate it.
