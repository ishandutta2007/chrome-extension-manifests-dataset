When the extension is enabled, it will route all started downloads to Varia. This way, you don't have to manually copy and paste the link in order to download it via Varia.\n\nIn order to route the downloads to Varia, make sure to flip the switch in the extension, and make sure Varia is not running in remote mode.\n\nVaria is currently available for Linux and Windows.\n\nVaria uses aria2 under the hood, running on the 6801 port. If you have an aria2c daemon locally running on that port, you could use this extension for that as well, but it was primarily built for use with Varia.\n\nVaria - and this browser extension - is an open source project licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0. You can find it on GitHub to check it out, submit bug reports, or contribute code.\n\nhttps://github.com/giantpinkrobots/varia"
