The LeetCode Participant Locator addresses this issue by providing a straightforward way to locate your position in the contest list and explore other participants' codes without manually searching through the entire list. Please note that this extension does not display the actual rank of a user, but rather their position in the contest list.\n\nIf your friends have hidden the submission section on LeetCode, don't worry; this extension allows you to view their codes even if they have hidden their submissions.\n\nNote: To predict your rank and rating, you can use the LeetCode contest rating predictor (LCCN).\n\nFeatures:-\n->Quickly find your position in the contest list.\n->Easily view other users' codes.\n->Seamlessly integrates with LeetCode's contest page.\n->Can find users up to standing 16k in any contest.\n\nUsage:-\n1) Activate the extension by clicking on the LeetCode Participant Locator icon in the \n     Chrome toolbar.\n2) Select the type and number of contest. Eg - Weekly 355.\n    On first use and every 5 hours thereafter, the extension will fetch and update the \n    latest contest data. This initial load can take 2-3 minutes.\n3) Enter a username, and the extension will provide the page number where the user \n     can be found in the LeetCode contest standings.\n4) View and analyse other users' codes directly from the contest page by editing the \n     URL with the desired page Number and contest type.\n\nExample:-\n# Open LeetCode contest ranking page for page no.5 and weekly contest 398\nhttps://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-398/ranking/5/\n\n# Open LeetCode contest ranking page for page no.51 and Bi-weekly contest 112\nhttps://leetcode.com/contest/Biweekly-contest-112/ranking/51/\n\nFor any issues or feature requests, please open an issue on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Raj-kansagra/LC-Participant-Locator.git\nDon't forget to give a review on the Reviews tab if this extension helped you! :) ‚≠ê"
