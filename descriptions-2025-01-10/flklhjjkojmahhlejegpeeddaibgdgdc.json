It belongs to the popular Suika genre and revolves around watermelons. In this merge puzzle game, your objective is to strategically drop different types of blobs into a cup. As you drop them, the bouncy blobs fall individually, and when two blobs of the same type collide, they merge to form a larger blob. The challenge lies in creating the biggest blob possible without causing the cup to overflow. Be careful, as if the cup becomes too full and a blob spills over, the game ends. Test your skills and see how large you can grow your blob!
