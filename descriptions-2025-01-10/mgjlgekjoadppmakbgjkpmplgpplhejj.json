What is commonly referred to as the \"White Screen of Death\" (WSoD) is great for inspecting exceptions while developing. But this page is just so bright that when you launch a website from Code or Visual Studio with dark mode, the page is instantly burned into the retina of your eyes. That's why we've build \"Dark Screen of Death\" (DSoD).\n\nWith DSoD you get a beautiful dark mode version of the WSoD. Enable or disable it directly from the exception page."
