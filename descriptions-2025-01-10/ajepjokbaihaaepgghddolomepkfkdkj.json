Select the people you trust and automatically block the influencers they have tagged. You can select the people you trust based on their alignment with your values and opinions.\n\nWe know that social media platforms can't be trusted to deliver reliable and equitable content moderation. They underinvest in effective content moderation and their moderation rules may not align with our views.\n\nWith BYOMod, you take control of how you want content to be moderated by building a community of trust with the people you choose to be in our community.\n\nTo develop your community, in addition to selecting people you trust, you can also publish your own list of accounts to block and make that list available to others."
