Hyperlink Summariser is here to help! This extension allows you to instantly summarise a web page and all its hyperlinked references without ever leaving the current article. Stay focused and get quick summaries of the linked content, so you never lose your reading flow.\n\nKey Features:\n\n- Summarise the current page and all hyperlinked references in it, without leaving the page.\n- Summarise concisely for a quick review or in detail for a comprehensive overview.\n- Simple and distraction-free interface - No sign-ups, email requests, or annoying subscription prompts.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- You'll need an OpenAI API key to use this extension.
