Every dot is a week.\n\n\"Memento Mori\" means \"remember that you will die\" in Latin. Reminding yourself of the inevitability of death creates a sense of urgency to really live life. The Stoics used Memento Mori to invigorate life and create meaning. They treated each day as a gift, and reminded themselves to not waste time on the trivial but to invest time in virtue and living true to yourself. \n\n\"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\" ~ Steve Jobs"
