All of the functionality additions can be seen and used at the issues tab on any of their repositories. It is jam packed with additional features which GitHub does not provide.\nFor example:\nIt produces a ScrumBoard which allows a development team and project manager manage issues more closely by assigning them into pipelines\nIt has the ability to track issue description history and display who changed it\nAllows the repository owner to allow team members to view this issue history on a given issue\nAllows the repository owner to delete the issue history which they no longer need\nGives quick access to a slide in partial ScrumBoard for easy update of issues pipelines\nReal-time update of the activity on all repositories the user owns in the pop up window\nThe user can also donate to the project in the pop up window :)"
