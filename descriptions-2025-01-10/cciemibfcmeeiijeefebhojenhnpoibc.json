If you're a photographer and are interested in having your work featured, email steven@mindfulbrowsing.org.\n\n\nFree. Open. Safe.\nMindful Browsing was built by me, Steven Skoczen, to help with my own mindless browsing.  Friends liked it, so I made it available for free on the chrome store.\n\nMindful Browsing doesn't track any of your activity, and the code is open-source so that you (or a geeky friend) can verify nothing sneaky is going on.\n\nI hope you Mindful Browsing makes your life a bit better.  If you have ideas, I'd love to hear from you.\n\n\n\nNote: If you're looking for a way to block sites entirely, there are a host of other extensions out there.  Do a search for stay focused, or block site, or study blocker.  A lot of people have built ways to completely block sites for a period of time.  Mindful Browsing isn't one of them - we believe that it's better to learn to be mindful about browsing than relying on a computer to enforce it.  Think of it this way: if you hurt your leg, in the long run, would you rather do rehab and build your muscles, or use crutches for the rest of your life? :)\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nVersion 1.2.6\n- Updates to Chrome Extension V3 permissions.  This means the extension no longer needs the tabs or webNavigation permissions.  Hooray for fewer permissions!\n\nVersion 1.2.4\n- Adds new images.\n\nVersion 1.2.2:\n- Updates all images to SSL, so no warning appears on secured sites.\n\nVersion 1.2.1:\n- Fixed a bug that was causing images not to load.\n\nVersion 1.2:\n- Lots of new images, now changing daily\n- Hides the confirmation for small popups (like Facebook and Twitter's \"Authorize this app\" screens.)\n- Saves the daily image locally, for much faster and prettier responses.\n- A few odds and ends, like better fonts support, some tweaked spacing, and other beauties.\n\nVersion 1.1:\n- Fixes a couple bugs, including close button and empty lists. \n- Makes edit popup easier to read.\n- Even better credit of the incredible photographers we feature.\n\nVersion 1.0:\n - Initial release."
