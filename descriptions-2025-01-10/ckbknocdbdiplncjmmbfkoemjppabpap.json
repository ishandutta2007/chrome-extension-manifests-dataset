All while giving your favorite creators the tools they need to survive in a more hostile copyright environment!\n\n\nYouTube Creator?\n-----------------------------\nThis extension provides you two additional tools on YouTube as a creator!\n[fallbackVideo] and [replaceVideo]\n\n-- Fallback Video is simple! It normally does nothing. However, if your video is taken down for any reason, your subscribers and anyone else who has the link can still view it as if nothing happened! \n\nTo use it, simply upload a backup of your video to Vimeo, then add this to the bottom of your description:\n[fallbackVideo](https://vimeo.com/#########)\nWith your video's vimeo ID replacing the #. Then, if you get hit with a copyright strike, your users can access your video right on youtube, like nothing ever happened!\n\n\n-- Replace Video is the more robust tool, for when you know you're in the legal green, but Content ID is licking its lips hungrily at you. It allows you to have a video in your users subscriptions, and youtube's search, with full monetization, and absolutely 0 risk of a stike. Its simple- Upload a placeholder video to youtube, probably explaining to users without Orange what's going on. Then stick a replaceVideo tag in the description! All your users with orange see your vimeo video, right on YouTube, and you are protected from Content ID.\n\nTo use it, simply upload your video to Vimeo, then add this to the bottom of your description:\n[replaceVideo](https://vimeo.com/#########)\nWith your videos vimeo URL replacing the #. Your video will be instantly replaced with the Vimeo video, all right on youtube!"
