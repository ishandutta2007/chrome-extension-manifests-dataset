This guides the eye over the text and the brain remembers previously learned words more quickly. This facilitates faster, more accessible reading, especially for neurodiverse audiences.\n\nNote that this extension currently don't support any kind of locally uploaded content, such as pdfs.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments or simply want to see how this extension works, please take a look at Quick Reader's github repo: https://github.com/c23mj/quick_reader"
