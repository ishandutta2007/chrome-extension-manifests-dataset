We understand how tempting the 'play next' button on YouTube is but we also care deeply about your physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nBut we don't believe in arbitrarily blocking you from accessing a website. This strategy fails catastrophically if you ever tried to take away a toy from your younger siblings. That is why we have a three-strike system in place. If you ignore the first two notifications, that is absolutely okay because everyone deserves a small treat from time to time. But on the third strike, you yourself should understand at this point that it's better to get off. In this way, you are empowered to make the decision that is good for you! \n\nThe story of PPALLI:\n\nAs the tale goes, when our team was sent home due to COVID-19, some of us picked up this habit called 'K-Drama'. After about ten shows, we realized 'oh, this might be a problem'.\n\t'PPALLI' means 'come on' in Korean. In the context of a solution to fix binge-watching, it means 'come on and get your * off the couch from binging'. \n\tWell, you still might feel unsatisfied even when you stop. Unless... you do something interesting before diving into another episode. That is why our team came up with the feature to allow you to pick an activity such as a five-minute workout or a 10-minute meditation, nothing intimating, to do during the break.\n\n************\nIf you have any questions and feedback, please visit our website at:\nhttps://tpi-ppalli.github.io/web-app/"
