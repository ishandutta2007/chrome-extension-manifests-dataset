You can update the current city from the options page (requires geolocation permission). There is also a searchbar at the top toolbar to search for a new city. Once a city is found, please click on the - GO - button to search for the specific city. If you want the current city as the default location, please click on the - Set as default - button in the top toolbar. To add a city to the favorites list, please click on the - Add to favorites button. All the favorites items appear in the favorites tab. In the settings tab, there are several settings to adjust, including temperature unit, decimal point for badge icon text and etc. \n\nNote: this addon uses the free weather API from the - openweathermap.org - website which requires an API key. Each free key only allows up to 60 requests per minute. Therefore, before using the app please navigate to (https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) website, and signup to get a free API key for your addon. Then, add it to the setting page (bottom section). Once a new API key is added, you can start using the app. To read the privacy policy regarding the weather API, please read this page (https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy) on the openweathermap.org website.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/weather-forecast.html)."
