You will see a red dashed border around any coloring page image that is compatible and can be loaded into Create-N-Color. Just click the image and another tab will open to the link generator page on create-n-color.com; once the page opens just click the \"Share this page\" icon in the browser toolbar and select \"send to your devices\". Once you receive the notification click the link that says \"Open in Create-N-Color\"\n\nThat is it! Enjoy coloring!\n\nNote: Currently this extension is free to use and you don't need a Create-N-Color subscription to use this and can color any coloring page from the internet; but we reserve the right to require a Create-N-Color subscription at any point in the future.."
