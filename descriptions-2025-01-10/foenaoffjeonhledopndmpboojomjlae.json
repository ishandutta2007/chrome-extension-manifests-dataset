This method is much faster.\n- Limit number of comments: Decide for yourself if you want to include only 100 or 10000 or any other number of comments.\n- Calculate weighted sentiment: Likes left on a comment will be taken into account when calculating the sentiment. So not only the comment authors have an influence, but also the people who just leave a like.\n- Calculate on load: If you choose the API, you can have the sentiment calculated automatically when the video loads, without having to think about it.\n\nSupported comment languages: English (More coming soon)"
