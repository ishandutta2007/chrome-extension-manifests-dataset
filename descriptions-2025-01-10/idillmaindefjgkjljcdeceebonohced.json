It supports both the on-premise and cloud offerings of Jira.\n\nIt generates the command to create a new git branch, with the branch name having the format - \"PROJECTNAME-TICKETID-the-ticket-title\".\n\nThe entire command generated is like \"git checkout -b PROJECTNAME-TICKETID-the-ticket-title\". There is also a copy button which copies the entire command. The generated command is also editable if the developer wants to edit it. All these make it a good productivity hack for developers when they want to create a new branch on git for the Jira ticket they are working on. \n\nIf the current opened tab is not a Jira ticket then this command won't be generated.\n\nNOTE: This is not an Atlassian owned product/extension or in any way related to Atlassian company. It is an independently built developer productivity tool. Supports both cloud and on-premise (tested with Jira v9.12.14) offerings of Jira."
