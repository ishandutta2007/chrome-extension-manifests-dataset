Give you the Ah-ha moment of TRUELY understanding.\n-The difference between our extension and other LLM-driven translator: We combine the context of the selected word with the LLM to get the specific meaning, not the general meaning which has nothing to do with your context.\n-We also provide the original meaning for better understanding!\n-Use AI to boost your English Learning.
