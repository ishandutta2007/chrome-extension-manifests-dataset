I am too. That's why I made this extension to remove the tedium that comes with adding journal articles to my reference list. \n\nHow does it work? Simple!\n1. Navigate to the RMIT library page for the article you want to cite\n2. Click \"RMIT Harvard\" \n3. Copy-paste the result into your reference list. \n\nWant to get a citation without using the library website? I can do that too. \n1. Click on the puzzle piece on the top right of Chrome (if you pin the extension you can skip this step)\n2. Click \"RMIT Harvard Citation Tool\"\n3. Enter the DOI\n\nWith something this simple it's a surprise RMIT hasn't implemented something like this already...\n\nDISCLAIMER: This tool currently has only been designed to work for journal articles, and I don't guarantee every citation will be perfect. Make sure to double check Easy Cite and if any article breaks the tool please share it with me so I can fix it."
