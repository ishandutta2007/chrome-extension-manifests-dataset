It provides:\n\n- A seamless one-click experience for instantly downloading preview files not only via the item page, but directly from the results/listing pages as well!  \n- Automatic renaming for improved organization, so you'll never lose track of that item preview ever again.\n\nThe extension works invisibly behind the scenes, so you can browse the marketplace as usual without even knowing it's there.  A simple but flexible options page allows you to enable / disable features as well as create your own file naming convention using any combination of custom text and item information!\n\nWorks great for preview files & images on all applicable marketplaces, including AudioJungle, VideoHive, GraphicRiver, PhotoDune, and 3DOcean too!"
