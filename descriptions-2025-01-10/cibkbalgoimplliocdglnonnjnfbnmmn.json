This chrome extension operates only as part of the full product and does nothing if installed by itself. \n\nTo achieve this the extension requires extensive permissions: tabs, webNavigation, notifications, and unlimited storage - and of course, permission to access all http/https pages.\n\nThe SteelCentral product in its entirety and the chrome extension in particular adhere to strict security and privacy standards - including GDPR and HIPAA. For full details refer to our privacy page: https://help.aternity.com/privacy\n\nWhen operational, clicking on the popup icon this extension displays an interactive page that creates 'web activities', encoding a sequence of user interactions to track by the organization. This created web activities are tracked by an in-page sidebar with notifications for each individual interaction."
