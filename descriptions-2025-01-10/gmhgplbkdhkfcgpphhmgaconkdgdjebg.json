Think about the money you would've saved if you would've stopped trading: is it hundreds, thousands, or maybe more?\n\nYou're not alone if you've ever thought to yourself: \"I should've just walked away\". Managing emotions is the hardest thing to do in trading and trading platforms are specifically designed to make you lose control of your impulses\n\nThat's why we developed NOverTrade (patent pending). NOverTrade was created to help traders stay disciplined and manage risk.\n\nWe believe that every traders' greatest edge is mastering ego and emotions, so we designed a tool to prevent self-destructive instincts from getting in the way of success. \n\nNOverTrade is a browser extension that helps traders avoid emotionally over-trading. \n\nInstall the extension and set a PnL threshold (ex: -$100 or $200). Once the threshold is breached, our app will block the trading site for 14 hours, preventing additional risky and impulsive trades.\n\nThe concept is simple, but powerful. Trade with confidence knowing that NOverTrade is here to systematically help manage your emotions.\n\nNOverTrade: Trade Disciplined.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTES*\n\n- This does NOT replace the need for stop loss and take profit orders. There is no direct integration with trading platforms. If you don't set those orders and your threshold is breached, the site will be blocked and your trade will remain open\n\n- Contact support at info@novertrade.com\n\n- We are NOT affiliated with any brokers or trading platforms. The extension is a SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY TOOL NOT AFFILIATED WITH NOR ENDORSED BY any brokers or trading platforms. See full Terms of Use below\n\nThe extension is a SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY TOOL NOT AFFILIATED WITH NOR ENDORSED BY TradingView.\n\nNo user data from TradingView is collected or stored by this extension.\n\nOur goal is to support your trading discipline, but it's important to understand the scope and limitations of our product.\n\n\nAcknowledgment and Acceptance of Terms\n\nBy installing and using, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this User Agreement.\n\nIf you do not agree with these terms, you should not use this product\n\n​\n\nScope of Service\n\nNOverTrade provides a feature to set a PnL threshold for the TradingView website. If your PnL meets or exceeds this threshold,\n\naccess to TradingView will be blocked for a 14 hours time period to help manage trading activity.\n\n\nLimitation of Liability\n\nThis is not a financial tool, has no integration with TradingView directly, and does not replace the need for comprehensive risk management strategies, such as stop-loss orders. The extension is designed to serve as a safety net for managing trading discipline only. Users voluntarily choose to install and set their own blocking parameters. The extension does not modify, interfere with or reverse engineer TradingView's platform\n\n​\n\nNo Guarantee of Financial Performance\n\nYou acknowledge that NOverTrade does not guarantee any improvement in your trading performance or prevention of financial losses.\n\nTrading involves significant risk, and it is possible to lose more than your initial investment.\n\n​\n\nYour Responsibility\n\nIt is your responsibility to set appropriate PnL thresholds and to employ additional risk management strategies like stop loss orders.\n\nNOverTrade shall not be liable for any financial losses, missed trading opportunities, or any other damages resulting from the use of this extension.\n\n​\n\nIndemnification\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold harmless NOverTrade and its developers from any claims, damages, or losses resulting from your use of the extension.\n\n​\n\nAmendment of Terms\n\nWe reserve the right to amend these terms at any time. Your continued use of this product after any changes indicates your acceptance of the new terms.\n\n​\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThis agreement shall be governed by the laws of the USA, without regard to its conflict of law provisions."
