This is a \"patch\" for what Marc Andreessen called the \"orginal sin of the web\"....not having a native financial system.\n\nWe stopped waiting for \"web3 adoption\" on every site and started enabling web3 actions on any website by default. With Patch, everyone already has a wallet and you can start sending them tokens, NFTs, airdrops, and attestations today.\n\nPatch currently supports tipping and NFT gifting on Twitter and Warpcast as well as a registry for anyone to add web3 actions to any site."
