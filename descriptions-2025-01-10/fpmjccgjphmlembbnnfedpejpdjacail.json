If the streamer has VODs turned on, you will be able to pause, rewind, playback and download the current livestream.\n\nRecordings of livestreams will download every 15 minutes. The recording starts when you click the REC button. When you arrive on the page, the tool will keep a 5-minute rolling buffer before you click the REC button. So, if you are watching a stream and decide you want to record what you just viewed, you will automatically get back whatever was in that buffer as well.\nWhen you click the STOP button, the tool will make one more request to the server for the most recent stream data and then download. \n\nThis tool is still under development, so there will be some issues.\n\nATTENTION:\nBe sure you have enabled kick.com to download multiple files within your browser settings or you will only get the first video segment when downloading VODs.\n\nVersion 1.12 update: (27 Nov 2023)\n1) added the ability to pause, rewind, playback and download the livestream *(if the streamer has VODs set to record)\n2) VOD downloads are now m4v files. This should help with importing to editing software"
