This works by signing up for an account on Boundless Digital and creating an Access Control List within the Boundless platform.  Your users will then install this extension, and use it to sign into your Meraki organization using SAML. \n\nThe extension enforces the access credentials that you’ve allowed them through Boundless, ensuring that they can only access the resources which you’ve specified.\n\nWith Boundless Access Control IT teams can fully control access to the Cisco Meraki dashboard resulting in minimized risks of configuration errors and sensitive data exposure."
