The objective of the game is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to reach the elusive tile with the value of 2048. Each move allows you to slide the tiles in four directions - up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one, doubling the value. The challenge lies in strategically planning your moves to create larger numbers and prevent the grid from filling up. The game is addictive and requires logical thinking and problem-solving skills. You can enjoy playing \"2048\" for free on the website https://monkeymart.org/. Give it a try and see if you can reach the ultimate goal of 2048!\n\n*Note: We have added \"Classroom 6x\" button, making it easy for players to quickly access the games on our website! https://classroom-6x.org/, https://monkeymart.org/"
