Therefore some creators might average lower ratings even if their videos are top quality.\n- As views count goes up, views/likes ratios trend downwards. Once a video reaches hundreds of millions of views it's very likely that the video will display lower ratings even if the video performs well in the previous like/dislike metric that YouTube removed.\n- It does not work in live streams\n\n-------------------------------------\nIf this small extension gets any traction I will update it to add improve the metrics and allow customization.\n\n\n// Updates:\n\n18-12-2021: Fixed issue where values weren't calculated properly in certain languages."
