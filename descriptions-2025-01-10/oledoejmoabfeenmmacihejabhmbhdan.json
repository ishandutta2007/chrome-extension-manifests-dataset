If you want to watch all the goals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, your query would look like \"croatia france\". As long as the goal is posted on r/soccer, you can almost always find it.\n\nWhat's new:\n\n- Improved the readability.\n- The dates of the posts now take into account the users' timezones.\n\n- Added mirrors.\n- Added options (only the default sort option for now).\n- Previous search query now visible on reopening the extension."
