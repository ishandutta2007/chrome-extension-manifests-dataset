Unlike other messaging platforms, here you don't need to know your conversation partner and their details to communicate. Chat rooms are created based on the context of your internet browsing: one chat room for each website. A relevant analogy would be to compare a website to a physical location in real life: when you're at a supermarket, for example, you can meet and chat with anyone present in the same place as you, without necessarily knowing those people. It's the same principle here: every website you visit becomes a virtual space that allows communication with other visitors.\n\nThe chat is compatible with any website, and its operation is completely independent of the site, meaning the site where the chat takes place has no means to moderate or censor discussions. Participants in the discussions are connected to each other via peer-to-peer, and there is no central server. The content of your messages is your own responsibility. Messages are entirely ephemeral and are not saved on any server."
