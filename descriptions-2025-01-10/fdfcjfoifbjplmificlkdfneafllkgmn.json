Simply select text, then right click it to select the \"Highlight\" option. Alternatively, use the default keyboard shortcut 'Alt+H' (^H on Mac).\n\nAll highlighted texts are saved so that your highlights are not lost when exiting a page! Simply re-opening that page will bring back all the highlights. NOTE: This does not work on very dynamic webpages like Facebook and most email clients. Support for these might be added in the future.\n\n➪ View and copy all highlights on a page\n➪ Copy all your highlights to your clipboard easily.\n➪ Select existing highlights with a simple click to either delete them or to copy their content.\n➪ Customize your highlight colors (and text color).\n➪ Change the keyboard shortcut through Chrome settings at 'chrome://extensions/shortcuts'.\n\n\nThe code for this project is fully open-source and is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jeromepl/highlighter\nHelp this project by reporting issues and contributing there!\n\n\n---------\n\nDisclaimer: This extension uses Google Analytics to gather non-personal user information and usage information.
