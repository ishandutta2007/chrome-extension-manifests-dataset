Quickly work the list to eliminate your challenges!\n\nPerformance X-Ray (Members Only): Find which parts of your workspace take up more resource and drill down to the function stacks, looking at both quantity and per-run costs. \n\nDatabase Auto-Documentation (Free): Export your database schema to DBML to quickly generate a diagram and documentation\n\nEdit Function Stacks Faster (Members Only): Change tables and functions with ease, and export lines of your function stack across workspaces without limitations. (More expansive than the built-in copy-paste)\n\nTemplate and deploy functions across workspaces (Members Only): Even functions with dependencies can get copied with their dependent add-ons, tables and functions. When you already have one installed (e.g. a users table) just tell it to use the existing table instead of creating a new one - its as easy as picking from a list! \n\nAdditional features:\n\n- Improve awareness by adding your current workspace to the title bar\n- Improve security by turning off auto-CRUD creation on new tables\n- Improve your confidence by tracking hard-to-find health statistics of your instances at all times\n- Works on all Xano instances, including administering in custom domains"
