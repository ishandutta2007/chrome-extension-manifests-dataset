You can click the Mastodon button in the top bar (or the keyboard shortcut) to share the current tab, or right-click a link on any page. You can also select text and pick Mastodon in the context (right-click) menu to share a snippet.\n\nThe browser extension can store multiple server options, and synchronize them with your browser's settings. It uses the share dialog hosted by the selected server, so no API access or account permissions are required.\n\nShare to Mastodon is compatible with any Mastodon server, as well as platforms that have implemented Mastodon's share URL scheme, such as Calckey and Misskey. It also works with the Elk Mastodon web client.\n\nThis project is not affiliated with the Mastodon project or Mastodon gGmbH. The code is open-source on GitHub: https://github.com/corbindavenport/share-to-mastodon"
