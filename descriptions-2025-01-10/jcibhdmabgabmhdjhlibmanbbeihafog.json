LinkedIn and Indeed show old jobs that are not active and promote listings that pay them. There are millions of excellent jobs that we never come to know unless you are aware of the companies. In this AI world, the search criteria should be more about how people think and where they want to work rather than the 100+ applicants for inactive listings.\n I hope you find it useful. Please leave comments on how to improve and what you would like to see."
