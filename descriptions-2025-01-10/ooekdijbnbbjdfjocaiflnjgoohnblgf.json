(State is stored locally using chrome storage and IndexedDB.)\n\nTedit is now MIT licensed and will always have a free option for people who can't afford (or aren't willing) to pay for it.\n\nCurrent features include:\n\n - Mounting local bare git repos (including repos with packed objects and refs).\n - Mounting github repositories and editing them directly.\n - Unified workspace as local git repository in app.\n - Full virtual filesystem editing including files, symlinks, trees, submodules, executable bit.  You can create, delete, rename, move, copy, even between different remote repositories.\n - Create commits to snapshot the filesystem state and publish when mounted from github.\n - Live export feature with declarative build system that allows building chrome apps on chromebooks.\n - Local webserver with same build system for offline web app development.\n - Full keyboard navigation of tree with typedown filtering.\n - Quick toggling between recently opened files.\n\nTedit is self-hosting.  I use it exclusively to develop and build itself."
