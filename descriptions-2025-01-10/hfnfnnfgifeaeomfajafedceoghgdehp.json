I usually have too many tabs open and I never close my old tabs. This tool helps me keep my Chrome organized. \n\nUse cases:\n1. If you have a ton of the same tabs open, like reddit.com, then it will remove all but one tab.\n2. Close all tabs that have not been opened in 2 hours (or any time you specify). \n\nI hope you enjoy! If you have problems or feature request, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to help solve this problem for others! \n\nYou can view the open source code here: https://github.com/jchiare/tab-manager"
