You can now extract the article list for any topic, the article specification, and customer comments for a specific article with this plugin.\n\nIn contrast to prior Weixin scrapers, our addon takes more than just the post titles and captions.\n\n- We extract nearly every page data, including Search Keyword, Article URL, Article Title/English, Article Author/English, Weixin ID/English, About feature/English, Article Date, Article Type, Article Images, and Article Content/English.\n\n- It works with all of weixin.sogou.com's URLs.\n\n- Bulk URL allows you to add up to 100 pages/articles URLs, single article URLs, or both, separated by commas, and export data to an excel file.\n\n- The scraper automatically grabs article data when you click the Start Extraction button.\n\n- Click the restart button to resume extraction from that product if the extension shuts for any reason throughout the procedure.\n\nHow to use:\n\n1. Go to www.weixin.sogou.com\n2. Type any keywords you want in the search bar, such as a brand name, article keywords, and so on.\n3. Use the filtering option and then press enter to fine-tune the search results.\n4. Launch the chrome extension and click the start button after the search results have appeared. The information will be saved in an excel spreadsheet.\n\nWhat you get out of this product is:\n- Competitor analysis: Export the entire article list in excel format, including the profile name, author, text, and photographs, for further analysis.\n- Market research: Find out how buyers react to articles at different times.\n- Restart functionality: If the scrapper closes in the middle of a job, you can resume scraping data from the article.\n- Bulk URL: A comma-separated list of post URLs from which data can be collected is required for the bulk URL.\n\nYou'll be able to retrieve the following information:\n- Search Keyword\n- Article URL\n- Article Title/English\n- Article Author/English\n- Weixin ID/English\n- About feature/English\n- Article Date\n- Article Type\n- Article Images\n- Article Content/English\n\nWhat types of posts are supported:\n- All of the categories\n\nHow many numbers does the data support: There is no limit.\n\nSupported sites: weixin.sogou.com\n\nException: \n- This suggests retrieving no more than 1000 data points at a time.\n- Depending on the volume of data, the extension may hang or require an unusually long loading time.\n\nTechnical assistance:\nAny suggestions or ideas for improving the items are welcome.
