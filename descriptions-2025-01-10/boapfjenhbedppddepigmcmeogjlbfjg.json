If an element contains a background image, a message about the method of image insertion is generated.\n\n### Alternative Text\n\n* Finds all image elements in the document and checks if they have an ALT text present. If ALT text is found, a message is created displaying the ALT text.\n\n### Decorative Images\n\n* Identifies decorative images on the webpage. Images are classified as decorative based on various attributes (aria-hidden, and alt). Each classification creates a message explaining why the image is classified as decorative.\n\n### Missing ALT Attributes\n\n* Identifies images that are missing an ALT attribute. It looks for all the img elements in the document and checks if they have the alt attribute. If not, a message is generated indicating that the image is missing an ALT attribute.\n\n## SVG\n\n### SVG Accessible Name\n\n* Checks all SVG elements in the document for the presence of accessible names. It categorizes SVGs based on certain criteria such as, the svg has a role of 'img' but is missing an accessible name, if it is following best practices for a meaningful SVG, and if it is missing 'aria-hidden' or 'role img', or an accessible name. For each case, a message is generated explaining the status of the SVG.\n\n### Decorative SVG\n* Checks all SVG elements in a document to identify which ones are decorative. Decorative SVGs are marked with 'aria-hidden true'. If the SVG has an accessible name, a message will be created that shows it's marked as decorative but has an accessible name."
