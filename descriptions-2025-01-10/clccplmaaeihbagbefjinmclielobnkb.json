We make it so even the most difficult to integrate applications - those with no SAML support, are non-directory based, have many-to-one or many-to-few access models - can safely co-exist alongside other traditional Enterprise apps. The minimally invasive way we secure these apps significantly reduces the footprint of Shadow IT while also minimizing the surface area for common hacking and attack vectors."
