You then have to open it in iTunes or some other media player. This extension simplifies that process by no longer requiring you to play the station in an external media player. You also don't have to navigate to an individual station's web page to download the .pls file. All the SomaFM stations are listed right in the extension's popup, accessible by clicking the SomaPlayer icon in your Chrome window. Choose a station and hit Play. The popup will update periodically to display the name and artist of the currently playing track. There are also desktop notifications that will tell you which song is playing; you can disable these notifications on the extension's options page.\n\nScrobbling SomaFM stations automatically is not easy unless you use an external tool. Even the Last.fm Mac app, which normally scrobbles from what you play in iTunes, does not work when listening to web radio stations. This app lets you authenticate with your Last.fm account and will scrobble what SomaFM is playing as you listen to it. Scrobbling can be disabled on the extension's options page."
