A lot of points could be lost if you make bad decision - which formation to use in defence.\nThis application will help you to make proper decision by making forecast - how much points you may lose in defence on average vs certain attacker formation.\n\nFor more information please visit my discord channel: https://discord.gg/kPj8ZzNZgW\n\nWatch demo on YouTube: \nhttps://youtu.be/5uG8Kr8lvtU\nhttps://youtu.be/YKH4rf6_oPs\n\nSee you on top of ToE. Good luck, champion!"
