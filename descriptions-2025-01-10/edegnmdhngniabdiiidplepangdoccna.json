Google changed it to show the names in black, with just a colored dot to the left of the name to show the event's color. This extension changes the text color back to the event's color, and hides the dots. Events take up slightly less space without the dots.\n\nTO CLARIFY, this extension does NOT add new colors, nor does it provide a new way to choose colors. That function is already built into Google Calendar: (1) Each of your calendars has a default color; that calendar's events are shown in that color unless changed. You can change a calendar's color in the Settings. (2) When creating or editing an event, there's a dot that shows the event's color; click the dot to change the color.\n\nOpen source, hosted on GitHub. If you have any problems or requests, the best thing is to file an issue there. Or fix it yourself and submit a pull request! https://github.com/adelespinasse/gcalcolor"
