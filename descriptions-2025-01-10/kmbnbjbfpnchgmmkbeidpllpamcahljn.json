Create an empty Spotify playlist\n2. Click on the extension button in the browser toolbar\n3. Enjoy a random selection of your favourite tracks added to the playlist\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nChrome activates this extension only when you navigate to a Spotify playlist.\nIf you click on the extension button it will:\n* download the list of albums, playlists and liked tracks from your Spotify library\n* pick tracks at random and add them to the current playlist\n* you can select how many tracks to add\n\nOnly tracks from your library are considered. This extension does not make recommendations or unwanted additions.\nIf the playlist already has tracks, the new ones are added at the end.\n\nNo login or access granting is required.\n\nIt is safe to navigate away from the playlist or close the tab - the extension will continue working in the background.\n\nPRIVACY\n\nThis extension does not store any data or communicates with any website other than Spotify.\nAny data it downloads is kept in local memory and is disappears when you close Chrome.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/rimutaka/spotify-playlist-builder\n\nABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nSpotify apps do not have a Play button inside My Library to play all our music on shuffle with a single click. This extension is workaround for that missing feature.\n\nThis is a non-commercial project by a solo dev. I built it to meet my own needs and hopefully it can help others too. I am open to suggestions for new features and improvements. All the code is open source. PRs are welcome.\n\nSupport: https://github.com/rimutaka/spotify-playlist-builder/issues"
