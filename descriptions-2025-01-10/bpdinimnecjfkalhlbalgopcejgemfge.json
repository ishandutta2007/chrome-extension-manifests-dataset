In fact, our web browsers are are full of them.\n\nAnd so, we offered him the chance to follow anyone around and eat as many cookies as he wants.  \n\nTo feed Santa your cookies, simply download and install the Feed Santa Your Cookies Chrome extension. Visit any URL and click the extension to see a list of cookies placed on your browser by the site, and then choose one, or more, to clear by feeding to jolly old St. Nick.\n\nIn the end, your browser will be cleaner, and Santa will be full… of holiday spirit."
