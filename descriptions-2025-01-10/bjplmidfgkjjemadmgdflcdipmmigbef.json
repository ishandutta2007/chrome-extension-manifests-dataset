You can see the current temperature, and the forecast of the upcoming week for your location once you open a new Chrome tab or window. It's possible to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit when looking at the weather by pressing the corresponding buttons. Whether you're planning your day or just want to be prepared for the elements, this extension has you covered.\n\n*Using a VPN will disrupt the extensions ability to see the user's location, and as a result it won't be able to provide the actual weather forecast.\n\nBy clicking “Add to Chrome”, You accept and agree to installing the My Weather Chrome extension and setting Chrome New Tab to that provided by the service and the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. New Tab Search will be powered by Microsoft Bing.\n\nPrivacy Policy - https://hbcmediagroup.com/privacy-policy.php\nTerms of Service - https://hbcmediagroup.com/terms-of-service.php"
