I often found myself constantly copying URLs (of blog posts, articles, etc) and pasting them into Twitter's search to see kind of conversations were happening around them.\n\nOld way to view tweets featuring a URL = 5 steps\n1. Copy URL from nav bar\n2. New Tab\n3. Navigate to Twitter\n4. Paste into Search\n5. Click enter\n\nNew way using ViewTweets = 1 step\n1. Click ViewTweets Chrome extension icon on toolbar or type 'Command + K' (Mac)\n\nPretty cool, right?\n\n***FAQ***\nQ: How does this work?\nA: ViewTweets shows you tweets featuring the URL of your active Chrome tab when you click the icon on the toolbar or type 'Command + K' (Mac)\n\nQ: How (under the hood) does this work?\nA: This Chrome Extension takes the URL of the active Chrome tab and affixes it to the end to the search query for Twitter which enables the site to show Tweets featuring the URL.\n\nQ: Why'd you make this?\nA: See above (tl;dr to scratch my own itch)\n\nQ: Do you look at my data? Are there any cookies? Are you with the government?\nA: No. You can audit the code on this Github repo (that's why I made it public).\n\nPlease send any questions/feedback/bugs/gratitude to me via Twitter - @julianweisser"
