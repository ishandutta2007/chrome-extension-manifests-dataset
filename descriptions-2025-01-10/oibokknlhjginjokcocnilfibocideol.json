For each Legendary Challenge (and inside a same unit), the exercise pool is quite reduced, and you're only allowed two mistakes. This makes retrying a Legendary Challenge specially annoying, since you'll most likely have to retype the same answers over and over again. This extension aims to solve that problem by remembering your correct answers and automatically filling the input with the remembered answer.\n\nLegendary challenges contain almost exclusively exercises of type \"Translate\", that is, those where you must translate the proposed sentence by typing the answer in the input. Nevertheless, the extension has been expanded to support other types of exercises and it will continue to be expanded in the future."
