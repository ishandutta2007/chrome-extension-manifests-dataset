Also check out our Icon Clock. It uses the icon to display time. See it at https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/icon-clock-tidiest-toolba/jemimfaflibimklmebhllpmhmbihpjma\n\nðŸš€ What is Top Rocket?\nTop Rocket adds a back-to-top overlay button at the bottom corner of every website. It works on most types of pages. You can also use just the toolbar button, if you prefer. The overlay includes a reading progress indicator and some cute animation too!\n\nðŸš€ Why would you need it? \nBack to top, and reading progress, are both useful features. Chrome includes a Top shortcut, but itâ€™s nice to be able to just use the mouse when you are already browsing with it. And reading progress gives you a very simplified but glanceable estimate of how far along you are in a piece of content.\n\nðŸš€ How do you use it?\n1. After installation, click the puzzle piece icon and pin this extension.\n2. Drag it to where you like it in the toolbar.\n3. Right-click on the extensionâ€™s icon, or most pages, to set your preferences.\n4. Turn the overlay off (and just use the action button or the included shortcut key to get to top).\n5. Switch the overlay from the default lower left corner, to the right.\n6. Turn off the liftoff shake animation, if you want to get rocketing a second faster.\n7. Use a shortcut key to hide the overlay on the current web page, until next load.\n8. Use another shortcut key to rocket to top without clicking either button.\n9. Click Buy Us a Cup of Rocket Fuel and support extension development!\n\nðŸš€ Is this extension safe? \nThis extension does not ask for unnecessary permissions. It needs access to the pages you visit, to add the back to top overlay on them. It saves your configuration preferences to your profile. It doesnâ€™t track or save your browsing or actions. You can right click on the extension icon in your toolbar, to see exactly what information it can read from your browser.

Updated context-click shortcut Corrected FAQ and privacy notifications on Chrome Web Store to reflect that this extension does no tracking of any kind, ever!\n0.0.2: initial public release includes action button, rocket overlay, reading progress, animated effects, preferences syncing to your other PCs."
