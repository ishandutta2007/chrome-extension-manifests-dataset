HappyPath does the same thing for paths.\n\nInstead of bookmarking www.google.com or www.bbcnews.com, HappyPath lets you bookmark only the path, e.g. /cms/login.html or /api/introspect. This is mostly so that enterprise CMS users and other lazy webadmins can gain access to the same tools across multiple websites, without having to type in the paths repeatedly. The company I currently work for has about 500 websites, all with the same paths to the same admin tools - so this saves me a lot of time. Maybe it will save you some too.\n\nCHANGES IN VERSION 3.2:\nPORT SUPPORT!!! You're welcome, Internet. A port input field will be following along shortly.\n\nCHANGES IN VERSION 3.1:\nFix to re-enable context menu\n\nCHANGES IN VERSION 3.0:\nBug fixes\nUpdated for Chrome extension compliance\n\nCHANGES IN VERSION 2.2:\nRegEx transformations: You can now add a RegEx transformation in this format:\n{Label}>{RegEx URL match}<<<{Link to generate (with option attributes in this format: $n)}\nFor example:\nEdit this page>(\\/pages\\/?id=)([0-9]{1,9}).*<<</editpage/?id=$2\nIf HappyPath finds a RegEx match on the current URL, it will create a link using the transformation path.\n\nTo do (in no particular order):\n - Save domains as well as paths\n - Customise query string variables\n - Keep query string when switching paths\n - Better path management: improved UI, grouping, moving"
