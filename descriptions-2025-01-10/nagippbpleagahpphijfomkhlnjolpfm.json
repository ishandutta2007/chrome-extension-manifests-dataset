It works by automatically clicking on PAA questions in the SERP which then reveals more related questions. Once it has gone through this process, the tool will download a CSV file with all the questions. These long-tail keywords can then be incorporated into your content strategy.\n\nPeople Also Asked questions are a key source of information for SEOs, content creators, and digital marketers. These questions directly reflect the collective curiosity and search behaviour of real-life, human users, providing insights into the specific topics and queries that interest your target audience. \n\nBy analysing PAA questions, you can identify keyword topics, understand the intent behind searches, and discover gaps in your content. This enables the creation of content that is highly relevant and engaging, and that answers the questions that users are actively seeking. Or in other words 'helpful, reliable and people-first'.\n\nIncorporating answers to PAA questions in your content can significantly enhance your website's visibility, improve search engine rankings, and establish your site as an authoritative source in your niche, making them a crucial tool for anyone looking to strengthen their online presence and connect more effectively with their audience."
