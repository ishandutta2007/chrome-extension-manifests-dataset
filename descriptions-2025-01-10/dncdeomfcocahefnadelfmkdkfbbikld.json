Dynamyx can be launched externally via a web route from another application such as an Electronic Medical Record (EMR), Laboratory Information System (LIS) or Advanced Visualization solution.  These external applications may be web based or they may be thick client applications. The Dynamyx application provides a route directly to a case or specific slide saving the Pathologist valuable time that would otherwise be spent manually searching for that case or slide.   Each time the external application attempts to launch directly to a case, a new browser tab is created.  Again, to streamline the workflow, this new tab will look to see if there is already another running instance of Dynamyx and simply instruct that instance to load that case or slide.  This again saves time by avoiding making the user reenter their credentials.  Once this new browser tab is done instructing the existing instance of Dynamyx, it should be closed.  While the user can do this task themselves, it is much more elegant (and time saving) if the tab could close itself.  Due to browser security limitations, this is not possible.  When this extension is installed, it will detect when these orphaned tabs are ready to be closed and close them."
