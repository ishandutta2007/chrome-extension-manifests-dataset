Dhivehi language, from the Maldives, is written in this script form.\n\nChromeOS does not contain the Dhivehi language, nor an input keyboard to type in Thaana. This extension creates a new input keyboard for Thaana Phonetic typing. This new keyboard is attached to the existing Hebrew language, another right-to-left written language like Dhivehi.\n\n\nSteps to Install ;\n==============================\n  1.   Install this extension.\n  2.   Install the Hebrew language (if not installed). \n  3.   From input methods, select Thaana Phonetic Keyboard (if not selected).\n  \nThat's it. You can now type Dhivehi from the same Thaana Phonetic keyboards as on other operating system platforms. \n\n*Hint* : Use Ctrl+Shift+Space to cycle through keyboards.\n\n\nGotchas !\n==============================\nChromeOS does not provide an API for custom font installations that follows the user on to other devices. This extension does not provide any Thaana script fonts. This extension depends on the builtin Unicode font available on ChromeOS to display Thaana characters. \n \n*Hint* : In GSuite applications, convert the working document, sheet, slide, etc to the builtin PDF. Google substitutes a font that has much more pleasing Thaana Unicode characters. Display and/or print these PDFs to show aesthetically professional Thaana documents. \n\n\nThe POWER keyboard\n==============================\nThis Thaana keyboard also provides command keys for fast outputs. The back tick ` starts a command sequence. The following commands are available :\n\n\t``\t\t=> `\n\t`aa\t\t=> Allah in Arabic\n\t`ab\t\t=> Bismillah in Arabic\n\t`dh\t\t=> Hijree date\n\t`dg\t\t=> Gregorian data in Thaana script\n\t`ld\t\t=> list of weekdays in Thaana script\n\t`lmh\t=> list of Hijri months in Thaana script\n\t`lmg\t=> list of Gregorian months in Thaana script\n\t`sv\t\t=> letter writing - vedhun salaam... in Thaana script\n\t`sw\t\t=> letter writing - ikhthiraam gabool... in Thaana script\n\n\nUpdates\n==============================\n1.0.2 (2020-07-15): Code and documentation improvements.\n1.0.1 (2020-06-28): Command key functionality rebuilt from scratch to offer variable length commands."
