You may choose to only see quote tweets that have likes and/or retweets above any threshold you prefer. You may also choose to see both the quote tweets and the regular comments for a tweet in the same place. You may opt to see just the quote tweets from the people you follow, and/or quote tweets from verified users. And finally, you can choose to see only the quote tweets that contain and/or don't contain certain words.\n\nTo view the Quote Tweets for any Tweet, click on 'Q' among the icons at the bottom of the Tweet.\n\nFor suggestions or complaints, mention @dara_tobi on Twitter."
