It is not an entity that directly provides money transmission services, as it does not accept funds from one person and transmit them to another person or location.\nTRIO represents a breakthrough in blockchain cybersecurity and is specifically applied to online trade.\nTRIO Wallet is a new type of Identity wallet.  The wallet makes it easy to securely store, send and receive Ether (ETH), and Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens in a secure, private wallet. TRIO never has access to your funds.\nTravel Rule requirements:\nBe safe! All accounts are Identified (Identity-bound), thus bringing you in line with Travel Rule requirements, while preserving your privacy. TRIO provides the Identity of self-custodial account holders, the first ever! If you own an un-hosted wallet (hot or cold), you may import your account into a TRIO wallet and provide your consent to share your Identity with Crypto-Assets Service Providers as required by law. \nTRIO secure wallet :\nHold safe! Now you may create backup wallets without fear of being stolen. Even if your laptop with the wallet is lost, damaged, or stolen - nothing will happen to your crypto tokens, because the key is you!​​\nP2P  Payments :\nTransfer safely! For the first time, TRIO enables you to pay in real-time, any amount, to a person unknown to you, in complete security and compliance, without excessive fees. TRIO even prevents you from making erroneous transfers.  Newly created wallet accounts will serve you in the TRIO ecosystem for ether and tokens transfers and e-commerce/metaverse, offering you unparalleled security, resulting in fraud and theft prevention. (When we say prevention - we mean it!). This feature will require utilizing the TRIO Identity Authenticator smartphone app.\nHow TRIO Works:\nTo log into the TRIO wallet, one must provide his/her username and wallet password. To transfer tokens, one must authenticate his/her smartphone. Your transaction data is validated to prevent theft and fraud. You remain in control of your private keys, which are stored nowhere, but generated on your device on-demand\nTo start Onboarding:  https://bit.ly/4c6qc4W"
