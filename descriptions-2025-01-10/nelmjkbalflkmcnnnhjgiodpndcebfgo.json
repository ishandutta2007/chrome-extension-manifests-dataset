It also allows you to open, sort and close individual or a group of tabs.\n\nThis extension is very useful for those who end up with many tabs open without knowing the last time you even interacted with them, allowing one to easily get rid of old tabs. It also makes it easy to spot duplicated tabs and to navigate to recently opened ones.\n\nSee https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ow6f5zWRLI for details on how to use it.\n\nNote: Chrome shows a scary popup regarding Vertical Tabs View accessing your browser history. We do react to new tabs as a way to store LOCALLY the last time you interacted with them. However, nothing is ever sent to a server, nothing ever leaves your computer, this extension is completely private. Feel free to check the code at the website link.\n\n★ Vertically sorted tabs.\n\n★ Automatic group by website.\n\n★ White and dark mode\n\n★ Search bar that allows to search for title or url.\n\n★ Sort tabs by url and staleness.\n\n★ See the number of open and duplicated tabs.\n\n★ Highlight duplicated tabs.\n\n★ Delete duplicated tabs with one click.\n\nHow to use?\n\n★ Open shortcut, CTRL + i (windows), COMMAND + e (macOS) and CTRL + q (linux)\n★ Navigate your tabs using the arrow or TAB (on your keyboard)\n★ Open a tab via Enter key.\n★ Easily close a specific or multiple tabs.\n★ Click on the sort icon to sort by either, url, title or staleness.\n★ If you have duplicated tabs, click on the menu to highlight them or get rid of them."
