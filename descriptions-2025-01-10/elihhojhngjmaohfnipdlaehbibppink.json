Once known as SSRB Ball, this game has been rebranded to capture the hearts of cat enthusiasts and puzzle lovers alike with a simple yet engaging premise: combine cats to create the ultimate mega cat!\n\nCats Drop isn't just another casual game; it's a test of strategy and timing. Players are presented with a virtual measuring cup, into which various cats of different colors and sizes are dropped. The challenge lies in positioning these cats in such a way that identical ones merge, evolving into larger versions. With each successful merge, players see their scores soar, but there's a catch: space is limited, and the game ends when the cup overflows. \n\nThe controls are refreshingly straightforward, making Cats Drop accessible to players of all ages. Simply move your cat with the mouse and click to drop it into place. This ease of play, combined with the charming graphics, ensures that both young players and seasoned puzzle solvers can enjoy the game's layers of strategy.\n\nIf you have any questions about our Cats Drop Unblocked game extension or just want to give us some feedback, feel free to send us a message or write a review!
