This can also generate a unique password for each of your account.\n\nPassword Safe uses standard PGP for encryption, so you can decrypt your data with any PGP program. This program also allows you to automatically backup your data to Google Drive (in encrypted form).\n\nMobile users can open https://safe.manki.in/ on Chrome directly. There is also an Android app available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.manki.android.mpass\n\nCAUTION\n- If you ever forget your master password, it's almost impossible to recover your data. Make sure to choose a master password that you'll remember.\n- Since this app uses Google sign-in, do not store your Google account's password in Password Safe. You'll need to sign into your Google account before opening this app."
