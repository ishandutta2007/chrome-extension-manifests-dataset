The most popular streamers and games are always easily located near the top of the webpage. However, many people enjoy the experience of a smaller stream and a more interactive chat. This extension provides a quick and easy way to stumble upon a new streamer.\n\nThe extension helps you search for streamers who aren't playing the most popular games. Rediscover old games or just randomly find ones that sounds interesting. The list of games is searchable and always contains active streamers.\n\nFeatures:\n- Dynamic, searchable list of currently streamed games\n- Multiple games can be searched for at once\n- Minimum and maximum number of viewers controlled by a slide bar and manual input"
