Keeping track of multiple activities can quickly become a nightmare. \n\nFortunately for you, you have just found the tool you've always wished for (sort of:)\n\nKey features:\n  • Multiple timers, with multiple checkpoints.\n  • Easy to modify and adjust.\n  • The timers are persisent. Even if you close your browser they will be still waiting for you.\n  • Timers can be exported to and imported from a file.\n  • Keyboard shortcuts.\n  \nThis extension was initially meant to be used to track time on different projects while freelancing. We are actually surprised by how useful it has turned out to be, so we have decided to share it. Since we eat our own dog food, any suggestions and feedbacks will be greatly appreciated :)"
