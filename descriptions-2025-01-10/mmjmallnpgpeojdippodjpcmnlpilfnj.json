Create a timeboxx using the timeboxx extension button and giving it a duration. A notification will pop up when the timeboxx is completed. The big timer will take up as much of the screen as possible so you can keep track of your time from across a room!\n\nFor example, timeboxx is helpful in situations when you would like to:\n- focus on learning a language for an hour\n- focus on a half hour workout\n- give yourself 20 minutes to enjoy some funny videos"
