Do you find yourself wishing you could slide the navigation bar out of the way so that you can focus on content?\n\nMSDN Resize is a simple extension that allows the user to reduce the size of the side navigation bar and return it to normal with a click of the mouse.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBy adding a divider bar between the sidebar and the primary content of the page, all you have to do is click on the divider and instantly your content goes from 66% to 85% of the window. Click again to restore the original dimensions.\n\nRelease Notes -\n0.7 - This version is a temporary fix to account for the new MSDN theme chooser. The divider bar is now gray on all themes."
