The zlib library (1995) became a de facto standard compression library for gzip data.\n\nHTTP/1.1 in 1999 (RFC 2616) added support for gzip, compress and deflate compression as content encodings. gzip compression quickly became the default as it compressed better than compress, which used the patented LZW algorithm, and as Microsoft incorrectly implemented deflate as a broken raw deflate stream instead of the correct deflate stream inside a zlib format wrapper.\n\nCompression algorithms generally define a file format and how to decompress it. This allows the user to pick an appropriate compression level: either fast compression, which compresses quickly, but doesn't compress very small or instead best compression, which compresses slowly but generates a smaller output.\n\nWith gzip and zlib these levels range from 1 (fast) to 9 (best), with a default of 6.\n\nWhen you browse to a page with this extension and the content is compressed with gzip, a little badge is shown with the estimated compression level.\n\nIf the compression was achieved with a gzip compressor other than zlib, a fractional estimate of zlib compression level is shown.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe chrome extension notes the Content-Length of the page as it is loaded, then fetches the page again, tries to compress it with a variety of levels and then displays the result.\n\nThis uses more network and CPU. Use sparingly.\n\nTODO\n\nSome websites use the newer Brotli compression algorithm instead of gzip. This extension does not support Brotli yet."
