AI automatically extracts public email addresses and other social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc.), enabling you to find their contact information quickly. With automatic email matching and template filling, you can get the outreach job done 10x faster.\n\nFOR SALES\nEnrich your database with new leads and get more sales. With automatic email match and outreach mail merge, you can get the outreach job done 10x faster.\n\nFOR YOUTUBERS\nSimilarTube helps you find competitors. If you are a new YouTuber hoping to identify ideas or niches, it can help you analyze the competitive landscape and determine if it's worth investing in. If you are a marketer looking to find influencers, you can use it to expand your targets. \n\nFOR ANALYSTS\nThe AI Insight feature automatically assesses the value of the niche and highlights differences in core metrics among YouTubers of various tiers.
