Lets you choose from all downloadable content on a page.\n\nThe icon shows only when a page indicates that it contains downloadable content. Otherwise, the extension stays out of your way.\n\nMSI Multiple-file downloader uses the new HTML5 \"download\" attribute to decide if a file is downloadable. If anything on the page is downloadable, you see the download icon in your address bar. Click on the icon, choose the files you want and Chrome does the rest.\n\nMSI Multiple-file downloader works with non-HTML5 pages, too. As a website developer, you can put the \"download\" attribute into any anchor tags to instantly add multiple-file download capability to your web page.\n\n\n*** Changes\n\n* 1.4.2 resolved tab permission issue\n* 1.4.1 resolved storage permission issue\n\n* 1.4.0 download operations to background page\n\n* 1.3.0 make extension scriptable\n\n* 1.2.0 combine content columns\n\n* 1.1.1 include missing icons\n\n* 1.1.0 Remove \"links\" column\n\n* 1.0 Public Release\n\n* 0.8 Third beta release\n+ package metadata for store\n\n* 0.7 Second beta release\n+ Beta in name\n+ short name\n\n* 0.6 First beta release\n\n*** Notice\nPortions of this software are licensed to Media Science International, LLC (\"MSI\") under one or more contributor license agreements.
