It's also got many other features.\n\nFeatures\n\nAccept/End an incoming/current call\nPut the current call on hold\nReboot the handset\nSee current status of phone\nType a number and send the call to the handset\nRecognise tel:<number> links and start a call on the handset when clicked\n\n\nUsage\n\nClick the green/teal phone icon that appears in your browsers extension area. (usually the top right) Here you can see the IP you've set and the current status (will take a moment to update on first open) Every 2 seconds the extension updates the status of the phone by sending it a request. From the extension you can click the buttons to Accept/End/Hold a call and reboot the handset. Please note the hold button only works during a call and the reboot button will immediately reboot the handset.\n\nClick To Call\n\nCurrently, the click to call feature only has limited support. There are too many different phone formats on the web so at the moment GS CTC only suppors phone numbers inside a link <a href=> and those that start with tel:. Support for different numbers will eventually come. To activate click to call, simply click on the link and the handset will immediately start a call.\n\nNotifications\n\nWhenever a call is started or other action clicked, you'll get a chrome notification. When any call is made it confirms what number you're calling and lets you quickly cancel the call if it was started by mistake. All notifications should hang around for about 10 seconds, but you can dismiss it earlier with the \"dismiss\" button.\n\n\nPlanned Features\n\nMore support for different phone number formats\nMore user configurable options (refresh rate etc) from options page\nOption to call selected text when right clicking on a text selection\nLicense\n\nThis entire project is open source. It's available under the GNU GPL v3 or later license. Basically, this means you can use it for whatever you want as long as you release any modifications under the same license."
