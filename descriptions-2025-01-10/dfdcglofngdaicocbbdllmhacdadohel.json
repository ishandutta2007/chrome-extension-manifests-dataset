Now, with EasyNotePad, it's easier than ever to create a short list or a babble-box for your thoughts! \n\nCurrent commands: <list> creates a list of items\n\nCOMING SOON: Options page to control how big your text size is, how wide your extension window is, and other such details. Also coming is a code view and possibly even an events/calendar view!"
