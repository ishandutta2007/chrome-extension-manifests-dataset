This is a brand new extension and there are many features still to come.  I have much more planned for it. Stay tuned for updates, and please contact me with the link on the options page if you have any suggestions!\n\nWe do not collect or track any data with this extension and it doesn't use any external code. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Hide marketing promotions (light blue box that sometimes appears at the top of the returns list page).\n\n- Hide filter options and tax return counts from the top of the page.\n\n- Open a keyboard navigation prompt by pressing CTRL-space. ** Keyboard navigation is possibly the most useful feature! **\n\n- Trim spaces and leading \"$\" in numeric input fields (so numbers with \"$\" are accepted).\n\n- If parentheses around a number in a numeric input field, make it negative.\n\n- Disable password manager auto-filling of tax return fields.\n\n- Highlight filled input fields.\n\n- Hide \"smart navigation\" toggle button.\n\n- Change pagination options to show more items.\n\n- Highlight the \"Notes\" button when the tax return has notes.\n\n- Open the Notes box automatically if a tax return has notes entered.\n\n- Prevent auto-logout from inactivity (as long as the tab remains open and functional and your computer is awake).\n\n\nNote: ProConnect is owned by Intuit, Inc.  We have no association with Intuit."
