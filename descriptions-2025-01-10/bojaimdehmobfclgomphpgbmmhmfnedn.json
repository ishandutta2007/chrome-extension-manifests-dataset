No more pieces of paper under your keyboard, or files on your computer named \"password\" so you can remember which password belongs to which website.\n\nWith FrostCandy's PassBank (FCPB) you just enter your master password on the site you are on, then it builds you a secure password to use. Your password isn't hacked because there are no saved passwords to find except in your brain.\n\nMake the internet more secure with simplicity. Now you can remember your password no matter the device you are on for any website even those you only use once a year without needing to go through the password reset process.\n\nWeb administrators, you can add a button on your site near password boxes that popup FCPB to make it easier for logging in, which means higher conversion rates.\n\nDevelopers: I initially wrote this for myself. I have 100's of passwords for sites I maintain. I want to have secure SSH passwords for each of them, but I don't want to store my passwords in a database or on the cloud. This lets me remember a simple password to generate a secure password for each of those resources no matter which of my development computers I'm on to access those sites. You should love this product most of all.\n\nWatch the two YouTube videos. First is an introduction video, second is a how to video with some extra security tips. This is not necessarily an easy product to explain to people why they need it, so if you get it, help your friends that don't. IE: My Grandma likes that her browser automatically remembers her passwords for her, and she, and her hackers think that's secure enough. :D \n\nNote: When you install this extension you will get a popup about giving access to web history. This is because the extension reads the web URL you are currently on to automatically generate the resource for you, that's all.\n\nv0.0.1.5 update now forces at least 1 number, lowercase and uppercase character if none are present. You will also now see the Resource (URL) that will be used along with your Master Password to generate your encrypted password.\n\nv0.0.2.0 changed the password generation to be more compatible with websites that can not handle some special characters. You can access your passwords prior to version 0.0.2.0 by clicking the yellow bar at the bottom of the extension so you can log in and update your passwords to the new versions.\n\nv0.0.2.2 You'll notice two new blue buttons on the left of the resource and master password field. \n\n1)The resource simplification button will attempt to take a long domain like, \"account.google.com\" and turn that into just \"google\". If you don't understand why passbank doesn't work when you generate a password with account.google.com, and then try to login with login.google.com as your resource, you should use this button so your generated password works across the entire google domain. \n\n2) The Master Password simplification button. It's a little scary, but most banks and many websites whitelist the special characters you can use to set up your password. Passbank can't tell what any particular website will require and often creates high entropy password that your bank won't allow. Use this button to select a single special character of your choosing and it will modify your generated password only using that special character. Click [clear] if you want to get the default generated password back. \n\n\n\nTo support my development efforts or for more information visit:\npassbank.FrostCandy.com\n\nTHANKS!"
