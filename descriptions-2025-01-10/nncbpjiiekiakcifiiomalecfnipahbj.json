The spaced repetition algorithm will quiz you on what you've learned when you open a new tab or window, reinforcing your knowledge as you browse the web.\n\nAdd your knowledge to ForgetMeNot in Q&A format on the fly by clicking the icon in your browser toolbar. You can also import flashcards from less awesome spaced repetition systems like Anki."
