Feel free to use either version or contribute on Github as well.\n\nBeta Disclaimer:\nIf you have any suggestions, bug reports, or want to contribute to this userscript, feel free to create issues or pull requests in the GitHub repository.\n\nThis extension is still in its infancy, if you find sites that make it past this extension, please submit the link as an issue in the Github repository."
