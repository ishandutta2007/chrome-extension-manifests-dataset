Hands warm under your duvet. Outside, in the room, it is very cold. You have been passionate about a successful series for some time. Unfortunately, the episode ends, another starts, HOWEVER the intro credits also start...\n\nYou must then take your hand out of your duvet, to face the freezing temperature, in order to click on that damn button \"Skip the intro\"...\n\nThis is where we come in. With this extension you let us click on these buttons for you.\n\nWe support a number of streaming sites, and will add new ones over time.\n\nSo keep your hands warm and leave it to us.\n\nPlease note SKIPPY is not an ad blocker, but an auto skipper. It will automatically detect which buttons to click on."
