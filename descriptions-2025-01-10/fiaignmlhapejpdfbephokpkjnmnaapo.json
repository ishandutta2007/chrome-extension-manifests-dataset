That way you can submit PRs with minimum relevant changes, even if you didn't plan ahead.\n\nBut why?\nHonestly, you’ve worked hard on that feature, but when you opened the pull request you can clearly see it would've made more sense to split it into multiple smaller updates, each with its own PR.\n\nSince your commit history is unreadable, you can't use git cherry-pick and wish you could go back in time and turn it into something that plays nicely in git log.\n\nNow you can."
