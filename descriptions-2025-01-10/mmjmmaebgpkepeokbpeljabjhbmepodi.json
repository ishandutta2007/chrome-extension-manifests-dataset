Clicking on the toolbar button renders Instagram in a standalone UI.\n\nApp for IW opens in a simple and stand-alone popup window (as opposed to the toolbar-panel or sidebar), and once closed, completely clears-off and won't have any further background activities. Having this behavior, it is considered a very lite addon and does not add any additional burden to your browser. Moreover, you can adjust the window size from the extension's options page.\n\nImportant note: App for IW does NOT belong or related to the official Instagram application/website in anyways. It is an unofficial app that is developed and maintained independently. The official Instagram software is only released for smartphones and the web. This unofficial app (browser addon) is a wrapper to the original Instagram web application and tries to make it usable as a browser plug-in.\n\nNote 1: to start working with Instagram, you can read this help page on the Instagram website: https://help.instagram.com/\nNote 2: in order to report bugs, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/instagram-app.html)."
