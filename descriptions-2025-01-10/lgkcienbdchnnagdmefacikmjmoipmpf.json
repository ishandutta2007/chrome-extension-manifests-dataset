To eliminate redundancies as well as to create more bite-size source files, developers often create separate documents and add hyperlinks to them in the readme. Unfortunately, this doesn't lead to a good reading experience (there's a lot of clicking around to read all the documentation). It sure would be nice to have the ability to embed a Markdown file within another Markdown file!\n\nWhen viewing Markdown files on the GitHub website, this Chrome extension will find links to other Markdown files on GitHub and automatically embed the contents of those Markdown files beneath the hyperlink.\n\nThe source for this Chrome extension is available on GitHub (click the \"Website\" link)."
