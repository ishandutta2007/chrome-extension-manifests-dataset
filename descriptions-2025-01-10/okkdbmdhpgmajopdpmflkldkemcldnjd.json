After opening\nthe desktop client it tries to close the newly opened browser window.\n\n# How\n\nThe way the extension works is:\n\n1. If the URL visited is open.spotify.com or play.spotify.com then\n2. Don't do anything if the URL contains any of the following, else\n   - `/embed/`: Embedded playlists\n   - `/embed?`: Legacy embed playlist format\n   - `/log/`: Requests to Spotify's analytics\n3. Remove the protocol and domain part together with the first slash and\n4. Replace those with `spotify:` and\n5. Replace the remaining slashes (`/`) with colons (`:`) and\n6. Redirect to that URL and\n7. Close the tab that opened the URL if it was a newly opened tab\n\nAvailable in the [Google Chrome web store][store-url]\n\n# Changes\n## 1.4.1\n* Purely a technical implementation release, switched from using webpack,\n  in the unreleased 1.4, to relying on [native ES6 modules in the extension.][es6-modules-extension]\n\n[es6-modules-extension]: https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/es6-modules-in-chrome-extensions-an-introduction-313b3fce955b\n\n## 1.4\n* Don't touch analytics/log links and legacy embed links. \n  Thanks [@claui] for the PR.\n\n[@claui]: https://github.com/claui \n\n## 1.3\n* Don't touch embedded links, so that websites that embed a playlist\n  can do so without having Spotify trying to open the link automatically.\n  Thanks [@shape55] for reporting the issue.\n\n[@shape55]: https://github.com/shape55\n## 1.2\n* Opens links to user's playlists properly. Thanks for the bug report Robin H.\n\n[store-url]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-spotify-client/okkdbmdhpgmajopdpmflkldkemcldnjd"
