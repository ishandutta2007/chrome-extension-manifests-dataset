By default it will be set to Alt+H unless that shortcut is being used by another extension. To change the shortcut, paste this into the address bar: chrome://extensions/shortcuts\n\nNote 1:\nIf you have installed a replacement New Tab Page, this extension cannot function correctly. This is due to security policies within Chrome™.\n\nNote 2:\nBy default in Chrome™ the Homepage is the same as the New Tab page, but this can be changed in the Settings. This extension does not have access to that setting so it will load the New Tab page even where a Homepage has been specified. If you use a separate Homepage and want that to be loaded by this extension, click the \"Options\" link in the Extensions page and enter the Homepage address.\n\n\nCredits:\nHome, house, streamline icon by Webalys\nhttps://www.iconfinder.com/icons/185038/home_house_streamline_icon\nhttps://dribbble.com/webalys\n\n\nTrademarks:\nChrome and Chromebook are trademarks of Google Inc."
