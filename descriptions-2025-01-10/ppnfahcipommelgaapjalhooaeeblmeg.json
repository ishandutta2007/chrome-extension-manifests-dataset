These voices are synthesized in-browser, requiring no cloud subscriptions, and are entirely free to use.\n\nThis extension lets you install Piper voices to your computer, then adds these voices to the browser's list of available TTS voices, which can then be used by websites, apps, and by other browser extensions to synthesize text to audio.\n\nFor example, after installing your favorite voices.  You can use this tool to test them out:\nhttps://ttstool.com/soundboard.html\n\nPiper Project home page\nhttps://github.com/rhasspy/piper\n\nPiper extension project page\nhttps://github.com/ken107/piper-browser-extension"
