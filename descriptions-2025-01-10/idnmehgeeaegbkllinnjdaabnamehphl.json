Or how early the sun has been rising?  Keep track of your day using a 24-hour clock that displays the time of sunrise and sunset for cities all around the world.  Since the hour hand only rotates around the clock once per a day, easily see and understand proportionally how much time you have left in the day.\n\nThe hour and minute hands rotate counter-clockwise.  This follows the convention of \"East\" on the right and \"West\" on the left, so the hour hand rises in the morning on the right and sets in the evening on the left.  When the clock hits midnight, the hour hand points straight down.  When the clock hits noon, the hour hand points straight up.  Since the hour hand starts the day pointing down, the minute hand also tracks minutes starting pointing down as well and pointing straight up marks minute 30 of the hour.\n\nBesides the day, the year is another natural, meaning not-a-human-convention unit of time.  This clock will also help you visualize your year: the four circles under the clock track one quarter of the year each, and the proportion they are filled-in track how far you've gone through each quarter and together, the year."
