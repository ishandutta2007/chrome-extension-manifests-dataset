You can even use a moving gif!\n\nSo go out, take a nice picture or video on your phone and upload it to Chatroulette!\n\n----------------------------->\n\n+ Usage:\n\n> You will need to set a selfie before using this. Doesn't matter if it's bad. The extension just replaces that selfie. \n\n> If you're using a gif, make sure its very less in size. Preferably less than 5 MB. Reduce it's frames and compress it before uploading it. Everyone else can see your selfie move after that. Make sure your face is visible!\n\n----------------------------->\n\n+ Github: \n\nThe code's open source! Check it out on my github!\nhttps://github.com/SuppliedOrange/Chatroulette-Custom-Selfie/\n\n----------------------------->\n\n+ Note:\n\nI do not suggest using NSFW images, impersonating people, hiding your face etc. I am not responsible if you get banned on Chatroulette for it. Please read Chatroulette's rules before using this."
