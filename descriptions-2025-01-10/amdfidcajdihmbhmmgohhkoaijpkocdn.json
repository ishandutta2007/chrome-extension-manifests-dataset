This extension allows you to get feedback on any Pull Request and possibly catch bugs you didn't see.\n\nHow does it work? Navigate to a specific PR and click the extension icon — you will then get review comments in the pop-up window (see screenshots).\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: Are the reviews 100% trustworthy?\nA: Nope, as of 2022. This tool can help you spot bugs, but as with anything, use your judgement.\n\nQ: What aspects of the Pull Request are considered during the review?\nA: The model gets the code changes, the PR title and description, as well as a list of the files and folders in the root of the project.\n\nQ: Does the extension leave any comments on the Pull Request?\nA: No. If you want any of the feedback as PR comments, you can just copy paste the output.\n\nQ: Why do you want this?\nA: Plenty of reasons! You can:\n     - Pretend to work while playing games instead\n     - Appear smart to your colleagues\n     - Enable a future Skynet\n     - Actually catch some bugs you missed\n\nThis extension is free and open source — https://github.com/sturdy-dev/codereview.gpt"
