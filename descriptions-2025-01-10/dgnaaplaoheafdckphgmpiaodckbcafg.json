In my tests, some URLs stopped working after one day and others still working.\nWORKAROUND: Added support to Google Album Archive (http://get.google.com/algumarchive).\n\n\nUsage instructions: \nOpen an image and just click (left click) over the image. A message is shown at the page bottom.\n\nThis extension is open source and can be found in https://github.com/ddo02/GooglePhotosDirectLink"
