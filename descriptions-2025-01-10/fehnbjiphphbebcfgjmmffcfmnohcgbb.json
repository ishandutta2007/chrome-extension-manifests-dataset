This extension is the best way to interact with these apps!\n\nSimply click on the \"Open in Helium\" button in Chrome's toolbar to open the current page in Helium or HeliumLift.\nBy right-clicking on elements in a page you can also directly open hyperlinks, page frames or multimedia files! \n\nOpen in Helium has several tricks up its sleeve, such as the ability to autoplay YouTube links where you left off, open Twitch.tv streams in different styles with or without chat, and more! Tailor the extension to your liking in the options page. Your settings will sync to your Chrome profile. Best of all, Open in Helium does NOT have a persistent background page that will slow down your computer, or any special permissions!"
