This enables SSO (single-sign on) for basic access to the system.\n\nIn the case of acquiring digital signatures, Integral must require the user to re-enter credentials to obtain a signature token. Since Integral supports SSO, by default the Okta widget will bypass the requirement to re-enter credentials if a user has already been authenticated.\n\t\nTo require users to re-enter credentials, this extension allows Integral to display the Okta widget in Incognito mode, thus ignoring prior SSO credentials (cookies), and forcing the user to re-enter credentials to obtain a signature token."
