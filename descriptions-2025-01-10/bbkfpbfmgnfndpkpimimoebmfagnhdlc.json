Let's say one is looking for an hotel. He will probably Google for it. Once he is at that hotel's site he is held back from calling since 1-800 numbers do not work for over sea calls. If that hotel is N-SIP's costumer the user will see a green tube on the hotel's site, inviting to just Click-To-Call - for free."
