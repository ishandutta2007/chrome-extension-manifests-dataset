It also shows how much more/less a user has spent on Reddit compared to the previous time period of usage (e.g. previous day, week, month, year) to show Reddit usage trends.\n\nNote: Reddit usage time is only tracked when Reddit is the active tab. Time tracking stops when the Reddit tab loses focus (e.g. user clicks into another tab or another browser window), even if a Reddit tab is fully/partially visible on the user's screen.\n\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/justindho/RedditTimeTracker. Feel free to provide feedback and suggest new features.\n\n### Current Features ###\n\n- Keeps track of your daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and all-time Reddit usage statistics.\n- Shows you how much more/less you are browsing Reddit relative to the past time period.\n- You can set a daily time limit on your Reddit browsing (go to chrome://extensions -> Reddit Time Tracker (Details) -> Extension Options). Once you've reached your pre-set daily browsing limit, you won't be able to browse Reddit unless you choose to update your settings.\n\n### Latest Updates ###\n\n0.3.4 - Fixed bug where 'week' time wasn't resetting to 0.\n0.3.3 - Minor bug fixes.\n0.3.2 - Minor bug fixes.\n0.3.1 - Fixed bug where color of trend didn't change color. Minor fixes on options page.\n0.3.0 - Added option to set a daily Reddit browsing time limit. Fix bug where sign of trend increase/decrease wasn't showing up properly."
