The checkboxes save their state to the browser's local storage so they maintain their saved value. You can see the example screenshots for the \"before\" and \"after\".\n\nPlease keep in mind the extension is currently in \"Beta\" and might have bugs or not properly support every statblock on d&dbeyond.\n\nI plan on only building support for official creature statblocks but the extension will still work for homebrew content as long as the statblocks are following standard / typical content patterns used by the official stuff. I've tested plenty of my own homebrew.\n\nFuture plans include being able to inject other content into statblocks like adding legendary actions or other abilities to creatures."
