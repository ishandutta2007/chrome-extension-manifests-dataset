The remedy is to map blocks to the grid on a screen size of 767px. When mapping them at this width, the spacing issues are resolved. \n\nThis extension automatically makes your 7.1 site's mobile view 767px wide, so you don't have to resize the window yourself. It also provides a \"mobile preview\" mode, that shows the original mobile view in additional to the 767px editing view, so you can see what your site looks like across more screen sizes.\n\nThis will provide a much needed fix until (hopefully) Squarespace gives us an editable tablet view in the future. Then at that time you can uninstall this extension."
