We try to find you the best price, as well as the most convenient delivery options for all your class textbooks.\n\nSearching for a class pulls up all the information you could ever want, along with links to the cheapest copies of the textbooks available online. If you search for a group of classes, you can also export them to CourseRoad, name and share them, or view and export them to your calendar.\n\nThis extension will make all references to MIT classes on the Internet clickable, as well as add MIT Textbooks as a shortcut ('tb') to the omnibar.\n\nMIT Textbooks is not officially affiliated with MIT in any way (other than that the creator is a student!)."
