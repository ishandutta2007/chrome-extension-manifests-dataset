The default format is \"> [selected text] | [src]([current page URL])\", but you can modify it to suit your needs.\n\nKeyboard Shortcut Support: Assign a custom keyboard shortcut to activate the extension without clicking the icon. To set up a shortcut, visit `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in your browser and configure a key combination. 'Cmd + M' is a suggested one.\n\nSeamless Integration with Obsidian and Logseq: Effortlessly copy and paste markdown-formatted links into Obsidian and Logseq, enhancing your research and note-taking experience.\n\nSecure and Lightweight: The extension is developed with security in mind, ensuring no unnecessary permissions or security vulnerabilities are present."
