Through HEX, users can not only create accounts and wallets on the Hedera mainnet, but also create, purchase, trade, send and receive both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) created via Hedera's Token Service. The HEX extension can also serve as a hbar (native cryptocurrency of Hedera) paywall for content providers. It's Defi at the speed, cost and security of Hedera Hashgraph"
