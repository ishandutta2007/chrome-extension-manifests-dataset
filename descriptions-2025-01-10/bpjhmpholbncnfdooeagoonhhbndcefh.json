It is like an advanced bookmark/block websites manager.\n\nYou can set labels on each page and domain, as :\n- USELESS (light red flag + top label on the page)\n- USEFUL (green flag)\n- IMPORTANT (blue flag)\nOr simply block the page!\n\nYou can block a domain and unblock some specific pages of the same domain.\n\nYou also can set a note (short message) on each page, by example why you tagged this page or why you blocked it.\n\nThe extension also tells you how many times you visited the current page.\n\nI made this extension when I was making a lot of researches on many websites and I was not sure if I already interacted with some pages (example: call the number, send a message, read the info...). So I thought it would be nice if I could set a note/reminder on the pages, hence the creation of this extension.\n\nWith URLs Manager, you'll not waste time anymore!\nIf you want me to add some features, contact me :)",
