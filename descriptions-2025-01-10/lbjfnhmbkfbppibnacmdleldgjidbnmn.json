It can be even more harmful if the products are related to personal health.\n\nOne way to address is to only shop products sold by the retailer website itself. This browser extension automatically filters out products sold by third-party sellers in the search results on these websites. For example, on Amazon, this extension automatically filters the result to Amazon-sold products only.\n\nSupported Websites:\n\n- Amazon: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, United Kingdom, United States\n- Newegg: Canada, United States, Global\n- Target\n- Walmart: Canada, United States"
