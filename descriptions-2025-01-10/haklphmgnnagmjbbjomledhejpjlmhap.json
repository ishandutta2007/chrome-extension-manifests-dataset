With SoundNotify, you’ll never miss a crucial update again. This smart Chrome extension detects sound notifications from any specified tab and automatically switches to it, ensuring you stay on top of what's important.\n\nDetection Mechanism: The extension detects the rising edge of a sound notification. This means that when a specified tab emits a sound notification, SoundNotify will detect this initial sound rise and switch to that tab automatically.\n\nVideo Playback: If a video is playing in a specified tab, the extension will also detect the sound from the video. However, once you switch away from this tab while the video is still running, the extension will not continuously switch back to the video tab. It only reacts to the initial sound rise, not continuous sound.\n\nWhy Install SoundNotify?\n\nNever Miss Important Updates: Whether it's an email alert, a message notification, or any other sound cue, stay informed by automatically switching to the relevant tab.\n\nEnhanced Efficiency: Save time and boost productivity by reducing the need to manually switch between tabs to check for updates.\n\nStay Focused: Maintain your workflow without the distraction of hunting down the source of a notification.\n\nPerfect for Freelancers: As a freelancer, staying on top of work notifications is crucial. With SoundNotify, you can instantly switch to your work notification tab and respond promptly. For instance, if you have only 30 seconds to read and accept a task, this extension ensures you don’t waste precious seconds searching for the notification source. This feature was inspired by my own experience as a freelancer, where missing a notification often meant missing out on important tasks.\n\nQuiet Work Environment: Enjoy a peaceful work environment without the need for loud audio. SoundNotify detects notifications even when your PC is muted, ensuring you never miss an important update while maintaining a tranquil workspace.\n\nVersatile Use: Perfect for professionals, students, and anyone who works with multiple tabs and needs to stay on top of various notifications."
