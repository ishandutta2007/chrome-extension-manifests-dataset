Amazon has different prices on all their European storefronts and even when you include shipping costs you can save quite a lot of money simply by ordering the product from a different Amazon store. \n\nYou can either check the prices manually by opening all stores in separate tabs or you can use this simple Chrome extension that adds a button on every Amazon product page that you can click to check the prices for you. \n\nIt's fast, easy, free and can save you some cash. Get a good deal on Amazon, get amadeal.io :)"
