Imagine the scenario, you're working through a form fill or on a series of documents, but in order to continue you must close the screen you need to be able to reference. The solution? Take a screenshot and store it in this extension, you can reference it from here.\n\nThis app will store up to three screenshots, and they will remain stored until you discard them, even when your browser is closed down and re opened.\n\nIt could have many creative uses, even just as a mind dump or reminder to do something but you don't have the time to write down the item you've seen whilst browsing the internet.\n\nThe app is stylish, works well, and is simple to use. Just take a screenshot, open the extension, and either use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V or mouse right click and select paste.\n\nThis extension has been upgraded since it's first release, the added functionality brings the ability to paste text and store it, and also tabula data (for exampe the likes of Google sheets or Excel)"
