The artist hopes that her work can similarly absorb energy from traditional culture, and then be transformed through her own visual language.\n\nEve is an East Asian illustrator/motion designer based in New York. She specializes in visual design and art direction. Her work experiments with visual storytelling through the use of illustration and animation. Her interest lies between design and pop culture, and she is exploring ways to combine both to make her work even more emotionally appealing."
