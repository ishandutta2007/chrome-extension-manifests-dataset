Why would you do that, you might ask? There’s a couple of scenarios we could think of: \n\n- Getting rid of a particularly nasty pop-up and directly switching back to the page that opened it (although reasons to visit such an aggressive site are elusive) \n- Integration of a web telephony client system which cannot be configured to call a URL in the - background, instead always opening up new (empty) tabs with a backend system that uses the URL called (to be displayed in empty tab) to display customer information in that applications tab (which we will then switch to) \n- Playing pranks on your kids by always closing off the time killing pages they visit in favor of the platform containing their homework… \n\n\nThis extension does not process or store personal data apart from the two values you configure in its options.
