I'm working on it, but you should be able tp navigate to another route if you'd like to see them.\n\nPerforator will help you determine your Ember.js app's performance bottlenecks. When activated, Perforator will time the rendering time of your Ember components and give you several ways to dig in to investigate individual components.\n\nMain features include:\n\n- In-page overlay of the render time for your components, colorized by relative speed. See at a glance what is taking so long! Hovering the tabs shows the component's classes and ember ID's. Clicking on the tag scootches it a bit :)\n- Sortable table of useful rendering stats and information inside your dev tools console.\n- A visual hierarchy of components as they are rendered inside the \"Timeline\" tab in your dev tools (scroll down to the \"console\" row label inside the \"Timeline\" tab).\n\nThe browser icon and popup provide some useful information as well:\n\n- Icon is colorized when Ember is present on the page, grayscale otherwise.\n- When Ember is present, clicking the browser icon pulls up a popup window that will allow you to turn Perforator on and off (for when you aren't doing performance tuning!), *which will refresh the page*\n- Popup has a button for you to toggle the visible state of the timer tags on the in-page overlay.\n\nNo personal information is required or harvested, and no calls are made to a remote server (check the code!). No reliance on jQuery or any framework other than Ember.\n\nProudly developed at LinkedIn!"
