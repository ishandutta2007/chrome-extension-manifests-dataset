(YouTube, Instagram etc.) It's very easy these days to visit such websites and waste hours without even thinking about it. With this extension, the guy from said channel will audibly remind you of what you're doing to shake you awake so you can ask yourself whether you actually want to visit that page, or your dopamine-fried brain just wants you to go there. This extension should help you to be more productive and to stay focused and disciplined.\n\nNotes: \n- This extension is in no way associated with the God of War game or the Far From Weak YouTube channel; This is a fan-project and I'm just a guy who likes programming and self-improvement. :p\n\n- Also, if the audio samples don't play, it's either because I'm dumb and didn't add said website to the list, or because the Chrome API sucks. Please email me about any bugs you encounter.\n\n- The \"reminders\" do not contain obscenities of any kind and are not intended to actually be insulting. It's like a \"tough love\" kind-of thing, if you catch my drift. I only want to foster more productivity and discipline with this extension. I'm also not attacking any website with this extension, only laziness.\n\nSupported Websites:\n- YouTube\n- Twitter\n- Instagram\n- TikTok\n- A few adult websites (not tested)\n- More to come (feel free to email me suggestions)\n\nPlanned Features: \n- Drop-down UI\n- User-customizable site list\n- Mute button\n- More lines\n(If I can't figure out how to add these blame Java Script lol)\n\nThanks,\n\nZachary Peel\nzacharypeel7@gmail.com"
