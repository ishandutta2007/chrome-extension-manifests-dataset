As for your participants, you can invite them with their email address through the extension, or you can copy the session’s link and share it externally. \n\nSessions is the platform that makes the most of your time. It turns pointless meetings into engaging, efficient & neatly organized sessions that consistently deliver a clear outcome. It allows you to prepare, run, and manage your sessions, turning them into powerful collaborative experiences. \n\nThe great part? All the tools and integrations you might need are available on the platform. You can forget about screen sharing and tab hopping. There’s simply no need for that anymore. \nJoin Sessions here: https://sessions.us"
