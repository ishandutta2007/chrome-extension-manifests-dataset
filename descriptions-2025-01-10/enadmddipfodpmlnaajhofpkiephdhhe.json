If that section or paragrah has an HTML id attribute set, browsers will scroll to it if you append it to the URL hash https://github.com/dergachev/chrome-xpath-link#chrome-xpath-link\n\nThis extension allows you to easily copy a direct link to any element (with or without id attribute) simply by right clicking on it, and selecting \"Get link to XPath\" from the context menu.\n\nGenerally the paths will be of the following form: https://github.com/dergachev/chrome-xpath-link#readme/article/p-3\n\nUpon visiting a URL that contains a valid xpath, the script will highgliht and scroll to that element.\n\nA valid xpath is either any standard XPath expression (eg //*[@id=\"dom-element-id\"]/div[4]), or an encoding of one as produced by this script (eg dom-element-id/div-4).\n\nInstallation\n\nTo use the plugin, simply download this CRX package file: https://github.com/dergachev/chrome-xpath-link/blob/master/chrome-xpath-link.crx?raw=true Note that it may be out of date relative to the source.\n\nInspiration\n\nXPath code shamelessly copied from the Firebug Lite chrome extension: http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite#Debug My Chrome extension development was greatly aided by this tool: https://github.com/Rob--W/Chrome-Extension-Reloader"
