Amongst other things, they make us spend impulsively, be overly influenced by what other people think. They change our beliefs, our opinions, and our decisions, and we have no idea it is happening.\n\nWhen we are aware of our biases, it is sometimes possible, to estimate the bias and then modify our behaviour. This procedure is called bias correction, and this is the reason why we built this extension.\n\nInspired by the Cognitive Bias Codex by DesignHacks.co. List of biases mostly by Wikipedia.\n\nUpdate\nIf you're looking for a more advanced plugin, get a Cognitive Bias, Mental Model or Dark Pattern explained every time you open a new tab from BrainyTab.com. It also gives you an amazing way to save and manage bookmarks easily (super fast search included)."
