No-nonsense, just that.\n\nClick the button once, and when the video finishes, it'll hit the replay button for you! Kasette does one small thing, but it does it pretty well. Watch the video to see how it works!\n\n- - -\n\nThis is just a version-one, so let me know what you want to see added to Kasette, or if you encounter any problems, through the reviews / feedback forms here!\n\nIf you're curious how it works, or want to make sure there's nothing shady going on behind the scenes, you can check out the entire source code on GitHub here: https://github.com/thesephist/kasette\n\nI've found it really useful to be able to put music videos or audio on repeat on YouTube over the years, so hopefully it's useful for you as well! - Linus\n\n* Kasette currently works best for English-speaking YouTube users. If your language of YouTube is different, Kasette might not work super well. Sorry about that. I'm working on a fix!"
