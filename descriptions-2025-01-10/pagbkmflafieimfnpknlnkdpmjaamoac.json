Virtually undetectable by anti-adblock warnings, HyperBlocker only blocks commonly used domains for ad and tracker blocking that are carefully vetted - meaning that HyperBlocker will never break a website. What's more, by eliminating redundant domains from the blocklist, HyperBlocker doesn't slow you down - in fact, it boosts your browsing speed greatly thanks to eliminating unnecessary requests. Blocks up to 97% of ads according to d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock. Hyperblocker runs with Manifest V3 with no issues."
