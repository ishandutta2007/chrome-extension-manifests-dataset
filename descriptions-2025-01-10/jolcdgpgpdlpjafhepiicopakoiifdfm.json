Simply click the colored lollipop circle in your browser to see the metric kilotons of CO2 / hr updated every 5 minutes. Check it any time of the day! \n\nThe Energy Lollipop will show you what times of the day your power is the cleanest and what times of the day (and year) it is the most polluting. Electricity is the cleanest during the middle of the day when California’s solar panels are active. It’s the dirtiest in the evening at dinner time and on hot summer days (from AC use) when the grid relies heavily on gas power stations.\n\nData is drawn from the California Independent Systems Operator. \n\nWe hope this data will inspire you to join our mission to get the electricity grid to zero emissions - through saving energy and influencing your local community.\n\nLet's get to it zero!"
