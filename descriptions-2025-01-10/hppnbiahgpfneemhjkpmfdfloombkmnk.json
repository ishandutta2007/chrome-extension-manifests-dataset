This extension allows you to create groups to organize your lists and scroll vertically as well as horizontally.\n\n* To create a new group, add the | character to the header of any list. This will create a new group below it. \n* Any text after the \"|\" character will be the group name\n* Long titles will cause strange formatting of the lists, but otherwise will not break anything. I recommend limiting them to approximately 20 characters\n\nAll existing functionality, such as creating new lists, dragging to rearrange them, or moving cards between lists, is preserved."
