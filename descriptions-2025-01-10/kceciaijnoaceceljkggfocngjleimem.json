Hackers do this by either getting the victim to click on a malicious link in an email that loads crypto mining code on the computer, or by infecting a website or online ad with javaScript code that auto-executes once loaded in the victim’s browser.ither way, the crypto mining code then works in the background as unsuspecting victims     use their computers normally. The only sign they might notice is slower performance or lags in execution.But fear not, this extension will block infected websites scripts from executing in your computer. If you are inside a website doing such practice, extension icon's will change showing a blue exclamation mark. This will be recorded in Cryptojacking Log Tab.\n\nShare your experience at the Chrome Store and rate Simple EasyRedirect extension (ER).\nExtension made by Adrián Arbizu Donoso (Spain). \nFramework used: Angular 12."
