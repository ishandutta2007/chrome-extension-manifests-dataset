These days a link can take you just about anywhere. Wouldn't it be really handy if you had some indication of what you were clicking on? With Link Alert you do! It'll highlight links with a little tooltip indicating where the link is likely to take you. For example, links to PDFs show a small PDF icon in the tooltip, external links show an icon and you can even see which links aren't secure from secure pages.\n\nYou have the option to select which icons are shown as well as changing some aspects of the display of the tooltip, such as the background and border colours.\n\nThe extension will also be updated regularly to include new icons and options. Updates can be found from the options for the extension."
