It provides the Mayer Multiple, which is a measure of Bitcoin's current price relative to its 200-day moving average price. This extension equips you with critical insights about Bitcoin's price behavior right in your browser.\n\nThe Mayer Multiple is calculated automatically using real-time Bitcoin price data retrieved from the CoinGecko API. The resulting value is then displayed as a badge on the extension's icon, keeping this vital statistic just a glance away.\n\nThe Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Chrome Extension refreshes the Mayer Multiple value every day, ensuring that the data you see is always up-to-date without any need for manual refreshing or opening the extension.\n\nMoreover, the extension provides visual cues about Bitcoin's current state. Depending on the Mayer Multiple value, the badge color changes. It turns green when the Mayer Multiple is 1.0 or less, indicating a potentially undervalued state. When it's between 1.1 and 2.3 (exclusive), the badge turns yellow, signifying a neutral state. When the Mayer Multiple hits 2.4 or higher, the badge turns red, suggesting a possibly overvalued state.\n\nThis extension also provides alerts based on the Mayer Multiple value. You will receive a notification when the Mayer Multiple falls below 1.0 or rises above 2.3, allowing you to promptly respond to these critical market shifts. \n\nBy using the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Chrome Extension, you can stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's price performance in a convenient and efficient way. It is not just a tracker, but a tool that keeps you informed and alert. This extension is essential for everyone keeping an eye on Bitcoin's market trends."
