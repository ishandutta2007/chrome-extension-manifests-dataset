In our district we prefer to have the Stream set to 'Students can only comment' but there is no way for a Google Admin to change that default. To prevent teachers from needing to go into every Google Classroom that is auto-generated by the Google Admin to change the setting, installing this extension will prevent students from posting announcements to the Stream even if the setting has not been changed by the teacher. This does NOT prevent them from commenting on posts made by the teacher.\n\nGoogle admins wanting to use this in their domains should force install this extension on student Google accounts with Developer Tools disabled otherwise they could use the Inspect Tool."
