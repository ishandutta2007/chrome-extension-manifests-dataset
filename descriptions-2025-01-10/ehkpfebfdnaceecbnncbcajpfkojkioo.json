Simply go to website that you want a custom cursor for, open the extension, customize your cursor, reload the tab, and you are good to go. \n\nIf you like colorful cursors but need a classic black and white cursor for more professional settings, you can set that up. Set your default cursor to be colorful and add classic cursors for all your work sites. \n\nIf you want a on theme cursor for all your frequent pages, go to each of your frequent sites, customize the cursor, and save them to your list. The next time you visit these sites your customized cursor will be displayed."
