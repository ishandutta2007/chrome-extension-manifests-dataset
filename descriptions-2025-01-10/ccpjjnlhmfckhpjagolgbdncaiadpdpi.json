Borrowing its syntax from plaintext e-mail formatting conventions, markdown has been praised for its slenderness as much as its easy readability.\n\nWith the language having become so prominent, it is difficult to see why none of the major web browsers comes pre-packed with the ability to render markdown documents. For this reason, I have put together a simple userscript wrapper around the <strapdownjs.com> markdown renderer, which ensures that any pages with the .md, .mdown, .markdn or .markdown suffix are rendered as an html document rather than plain text."
