If this small text is enlarged, the page and website becomes easily readable (especially for far-sight condition of eyes).\nThis extension enlarges text and makes text colors a contrasting black / white color and a few subroutines.\nText contrast can be increased by the 'Strength' slider, with high positive values making text more black / white and negative values keeping text color unchanged.\nThe strength slider also determines the Zoom %, with default zero strength giving 175% (1.75) zoom value.\nThe text size is increased inversely depending on its size. This means small sized text is made much bigger than larger text, which is slightly increased in size. All text within size of Threshold setting is increased in size with text closer to Font Threshold size increasing less than text much lower size than Threshold, depending of Font Increase % setting.\nText size of ANY TEXT IS NOT DECREASED (unless '--g_smaller_text' is enabled) to less than its normal size. Smaller text becomes as large as (or larger than) text of Threshold size. Text near the Threshold size is unchanged or changed very slightly.\n\n\nNEW CHANGES\n\nSetting '--g_avoid_negative' to \"nowait\" in custom / global CSS will avoid the 'negative' colors flash due to a wait condition in reverse colors. However, to completely avoid negative colors, g_avoid_negative must be set to 1 / true.\nReverse colors will now have short flash of \"negative\" colors (which might be avoided by enabling '--g_avoid_negative') and become normal in end (of processing).\nIf size (area) of background images of BODY tag is greater than 100 times '--g_min_image_size', their colors are  preserved in reverse colors.\n'--g_smaller_text' now does normal scaling of font sizes, instead of inverse increase. Text sizes will appear similar to original text. The amount of smallness of text sizes is adjustable by \"Increase font %\".\nStyle sheet processing for colors is skipped if 'Dark mode' is set. Bugfix for images with 'PICTURE' tag not displayed in reverse colors on some sites. Stop the mutation observer when applying settings. Mark as done the parent nodes of new mutation nodes.\nIf content is 'appended' to page after it loads, the page settings will now also apply to the new content.\nIn 'Start 3 letters bold', the variable '--g_start3_caps' can now be set to line / paragraph mode, in which starting LETTER of line / paragraph is changed to different style specified in the variable value.\nAdded Pause / Resume function of speak out loud when zooming text. The Escape key pauses the reading, and pressing Escape again resumes the speech from where it was stopped.\nEnabling 'Process black text' now changes originally black text to white color if background color brightness is less than '--g_min_bg_brightness'.\nNew variable '--g_skip_css_colors' which skips hue correction (and contrast) of elements processed in stylesheets. Setting '--g_skip_css_colors' to greater than 10 skips more elements than less than 10, and if greater than 99, skips text contrast. Default value is disabled.\nThe '--g_svg_bg_white' now also works for PNG images. Set this to enabled / 'dontinvert' if icons do not appear correct in reverse colors.\nBugfix for speak out loud text-to-speech, which would stop speech after few sentences. Now it might stop in long sentences, but less often.\nSimplified contrast calculation. If text color brightness is more than background color brightness, text is made white, otherwise black.\nSOME SITE SETTINGS will need adjusting. As the calculation relies on background color being correct (text color is generally always correct), most adjustment will be setting background color, through custom CSS, of elements having mismatch in color of background displayed vs. background calculated in CSS.\nFor SVG images in reverse colors, setting '--g_svg_bg_white' to 'dontinvert' will not apply invert filter to the images. If icons are not appearing correctly in reverse colors, try setting '--g_svg_bg_white' to 'dontinvert'.\nMany small bugfixes.\nThe '--g_skip_css' now processes only pseudo elements/classes (:before/:after/:selection/:hover) part of stylesheet. To skip ALL processing of stylesheets, either set '--g_max_css_rules' to 0 (zero) or '--g_skip_css' to 99 (which skips pseudo class/elements AND rest of stylesheet).\nNew variable '--g_smaller_text' which is opposite of 'inverse text increase'. Text size is decreased proportionally to size. So sizes near the threshold get much more small than sizes away from threshold.\nNew variable '--g_min_image_size' in place of hardcoded value 199 for images less than this size to skip applying 'Invert image' filter in reverse colors.\nPart of the stylesheet processing is now done by new variable '--g_change_vars' which changes variables of color values. Set this to enabled if some site colors are different.\n'--g_keep_colors' now works with text background / border colors and :hover/:selection/:before/:after classes of text. Support for loading of cross-origin stylesheets which depends on variable '--g_load_crossorigin'.\n\"Process :before/:after elements\" now does ::hover/::selection colors for hue correction in reverse colors. Use with '--g_load_crossorigin' and '--g_max_css_rules' to load all stylesheet rules. Default value of '--g_max_css_rules' changed from 1000 to 100.\n\"Start 3 bold\" option now has variable '--g_start3_caps' which, when enabled, makes start 3 letters CAPITAL and bold.\nText is now READ OUT LOUD by speakers through Text-To-Speech engine when a page element having text is zoomed. The language of speaking is set by webpage language.\n\"Avoid colored text\" option works correctly with reverse colors. The amount of colorfulness is specified by '--g_min_colorfulness' below which text can be made high contrast. A value of 256 / 300 will make all text high contrast, depending on strength slider.\nCopy/Paste icons on popup menu to copy settings of one site and paste the settings to another site.\nNew option 'Process gradient colors' to enable / disable processing of background gradient colors in hue correction to keep original color pattern.\nKeep text color same as original for short text with colorful backgrounds in reverse colors hue correction, which is enabled by setting --g_keep_colors to true or 1 (one).\nNew option 'Process black text', which is false by default, that allows processing black text when enabled or skip black colored text if disabled.\nNew variable \"--g_svg_bg_white\" which set to true, will make background of SVG images white in reverse colors.\nChild elements of shadow root are processed similar to HTML elements.\nVariables to allow skipping classes/tags/ids of elements from being reverse colored.\nA new variable \"g_max_css_rules\" sets the maximum CSS rules count. If style sheet exceeds that, it is not processed. Default value is 1000.\nBackground color is preserved in reverse colors if the colorfulness is more than \"--g_min_colorfulness\" value (default: 41)\nAdding \"#full_url\" to URL in Address box will store the settings with the full URL of the page so settings of special pages can be changed by adding \"#full_url\" to the Address box URL.\nVariable '--g_max_child' which sets maximum child elements a node should have to set its line height.\nVariable \"--g_foot_re\" in either custom CSS or global CSS rules will make footer areas of website colors as normal in reverse colors.\nZoom value (and the keycode assigned to it) can be given in custom CSS rules. as following : html { --g_zoom: 5.0; --g_zoom_keycode: 17; } which sets the zoom value of 500% (not possible by Strength slider) and the 'Control' keycode (17) to press (along with Numlock enabled).\nSetting Strength to -300 (minus 300) skips doing high contrast text changes totally, resulting in faster processing.\nRest of changes described in Help."
