This extension allows you to add movies to a queue that lives in your browser.\n\nBookmark permissions are needed because the extension uses your bookmarks (the 'Film Stack movies' folder) to sync your queue across computers.\n\nPlease report any bugs you find in the comments, thanks!\n\n\nUpdates:\n\nv1.5.0: Fixed for Netflix's new layout.\n\nv1.4.2: Added domains movies1.netflix.com and movies2.netflix.com for users of unblock-us.com\n\nv1.4.1: Adding Netflix movies now works in Genre pages.\n\nv1.4.0: You can now add Netflix movies to your queue directly from the popups in the main Netflix page!\n\nv1.3.3: Fixed plugin to work with the new Cuevana layout.\n\nv1.3: Added filtering by Series or Movies and a search box. Fixing bug with some series in Netflix.\n\nv1.2: Movies and TV series are now sorted by default. Movies that are already in your queue show \"Added to Film Stack\" in the movie's page.\n\nv1.1: Now it works for TV series in Netflix. Fixed bug with movies with trailers in Netflix."
