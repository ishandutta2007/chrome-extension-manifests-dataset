Then recycle the questions with FormRecycler Add-on. After recycling, toggle the Domain only back on for the Form you are recycling for (if you wish). \n\nSteps for success:\n1. Install this Chrome Extension\n2. Sign-in with Google\n3. Refresh the Form.\n4a. Use FormRecycler Add-on to recycle questions.\n4b. Use FormCreator to create a Form/Quiz with images in a question.\n5. FormRecycler Add-on will tell the FormRecycler Chrome Extension when it is finished and will enable you to Insert Images in your Form.\n6. Click the Insert Images in this Form button in the Chrome Extension.\n7. The Chrome Extension will continue to insert images until it is done.\n\nV4.0.1 update: Fixed issues after the change in the underlying structure of Google Forms. \n\nV2.1 update: Now will recycle embedded images on Forms that are in Spanish language."
