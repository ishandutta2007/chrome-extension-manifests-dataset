It used to show you posts from the subreddit you're currently viewing when you did a search.  Now it shows results from all of Reddit first, and you have to click again to restrict the results to the current subreddit.  And if you prefer the search results to be sorted differently, you have to click again.\n\nI finally got sick of having to go through 2 extra pages every time I searched on Reddit, so I made this Chrome extension.  Whatever subreddit you are viewing, when you search, it'll search that subreddit by default.  This extension also has an option that lets you choose the default sort order for search results.\n\nThis extension does not work on the \"old\" Reddit."
