But since they introduced their new Unsplash+ service, browsing it has become a bit of a pain as it's now crowded with watermarked images blocked behind a pay wall. This extension aims to improve your Unsplash experience and get you more productive by getting rid of all that bloat. By turning Minus for Unsplash on, you will no longer see watermarked Unsplash+ images in your feed and will be able to focus on those that matter.\n\nNotice: it is possible that Unsplash updates their site from time to time, which might break the addon. I can't really do anything about it since there's no way to predict the changes, but I should still be able to fix it quickly.
