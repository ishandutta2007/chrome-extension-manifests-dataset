Using advanced code analysis techniques and AI-powered risk detection, Socket searches for malware and security vulnerabilities throughout your open-source dependency tree and defends your project against cyberattacks in advance.\n\n---\n\nOver the past decade, it's become clear that open source software has won. Sharing code freely has made it drastically cheaper and faster to build software â€“ and tech innovation has accelerated as a result. But security has often been an afterthought.\n\nWe are a team of open source maintainers with over 1 billion monthly downloads to our names. Working on the frontlines of open source, we've witnessed firsthand how supply chain attacks have swept across our communities and damaged trust in open source.\n\nThe entire security industry is obsessed with identifying known vulnerabilities. There are hundreds of variations of CVE scanners, but they all miss the point. Looking for known vulnerabilities is reactive. Vulnerabilities take weeks or months to be discovered. In today's culture of fast development, a malicious dependency can be updated, merged, and running in production in days or even hours.\n\nUnlike other tools, Socket detects and blocks supply chain attacks before they strike, mitigating the worst consequences. Socket uses deep package inspection to peel back the layers of a dependency to characterize its actual behavior.\n\nWant to defend your entire organization against open-source attacks? Install the Socket GitHub app at https://github.com/apps/socket-security and get protected today!"
