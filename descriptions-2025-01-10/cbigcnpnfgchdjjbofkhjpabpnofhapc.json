Whenever you go to a Twitch streamer's page, Speedrun Buddy gathers speedrunning information on the streamer, as well as the game they are currently playing.\n\n*** Features ***\n- Automatically pulls up speedrun leaderboards associated with the game you're watching\n- Automatically pulls up speedrun statistics for the streamer you're watching\n- Provides convenient links to quickly get more info on the game, runner, or runs\n- Responsive UI and unobtrusive display\n\n*** How To Use ***\n- Go to a Twitch page with an active livestream\n- If game or player information are found, relevant speedrunning statistics will be pulled up under the stream\n- Cycle through the games and categories of information or click on the links for more information\n\n*** Notes ***\n- Gathering the data for a page takes a moment; sometimes it takes up to 10 seconds or so to update to the new page. This will not, however, affect the speed of loading the Twitch page. \n- If you're seeing the wrong information for a page, feel free to just refresh; that usually fixes it!\n- This is just a little tool I made for my own Twitch viewing experience; if you've got any suggestions on how to make it better, please leave me some feedback and I'll try to implement it!\n\nThank you!"
