We use it so much, there are little tweaks here and there we started writing to optimize our workflow.  We originally wrote Active Collab Inline Timers, but we needed a more modern tool that used current web technologies to add in even more features.\n\nActiveCollab Additions primarily provides a streamlined interface for tracking, editing, and submitting time to your ActiveCollab site. You can start, stop, and pause timers from your my work, project pages, or task pages. You can set defaults for your timers from the extensions menu in top right navigation area, including default Job Type, Minimum time entry, rounding interval, color scheme, style, and blurring overlays.\n\nAdditionally, there are many handy shortcuts available. One we use often is the ability to change members in a project directly on the task page. No longer do you need to exit the task, head to project members, invite members, go back to the project, and go back to the task.  We added a \"Change Members\" shortcut right below the task assignee field.\n\nAnother interesting modification is the ability to assign a task a job type without assigning a time estimate.  This allows you to predefine the type when you don't have a time estimate available yet.\n\nActiveCollab Additions was tested against ActiveCollab version 7.4.83.  It theoretically should work in all of version 7 and beyond.\n\nCode for this extension will be available on GitHub (https://github.com/drmproductions/ActiveCollabAdditions).\n\nDeveloped by DRM Productions (https://drminc.com/).\n\nChange Log\n\nVersion 12\n  - Fixed issue with task assignee selection\n\nVersion 11\n  - Initial release"
