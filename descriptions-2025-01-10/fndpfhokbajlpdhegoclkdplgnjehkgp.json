Unfortunately, there are many places where your only option is to type your message.\n\nVoice Drop is a Chrome extension that gives you the choice to use your voice where only typing is provided. Just record your message with the record button that will appear on every long text field, and then drop it as a voice link.\n\nYour recipients can play it anytime and at the speed of their choice. They can listen to you while looking at the context of the message, while talking a walk or fully focusing on the verbal and non-verbal content of your message.\n\nVoice Drop - Speak even where you can’t"
