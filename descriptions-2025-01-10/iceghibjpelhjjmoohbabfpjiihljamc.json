Uploading this one to share it with others who may find it useful.\n      • I will maintain and improve HueMore in my free time, ensuring it continues to meet your color picking needs. Feel free to leave feedback or suggestions for the tool. Your support means the world to me - sending virtual hugs your way! 🤗\n\nINSTALLATION and UNINSTALLATION\n      • Installing HueMore is as simple as visiting the Chrome Web Store, searching for “HueMore - Color Picker”, and clicking on “Add to Chrome”. If you ever need to uninstall, just open the Extensions menu in Chrome, find HueMore, and click “Remove”.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING and SUPPORT\n      • If you’re experiencing issues with HueMore, you can try reloading the web page, restarting the browser, checking for updates, or toggling the extension. If you’re still having trouble, please comment your issue in the feedback section on the extension’s page in the Chrome Web Store.\n\nSECURITY and PRIVACY MEASURES\n      • HueMore does not access, collect, or modify any information on any site you visit. It operates under manifest version 3, which only grants storage permissions. This is solely used for storing the list of colors that users have collected.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES\n      • The color list on the right side of the extension is sorted by the latest picked colors. If you pick a pixel and its color is already in the list, it won’t be added again to avoid duplication. However, it will still be selected, and its corresponding color code will be displayed.\n      • Please note that HueMore was developed and tested using the latest version of the Chrome browser. Compatibility with older versions has not yet been verified. The tool utilizes the EyeDropper API, which is currently classified as an “experimental technology”.\n\nFor a comprehensive guide on how to use HueMore, please visit --> https://color-picker-7v4.pages.dev/\n\nThank you for choosing HueMore.
