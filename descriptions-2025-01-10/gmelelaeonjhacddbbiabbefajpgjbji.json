The experience is great for Excel and Word based documents… but when it comes to web-based questionnaires, things can get messy.\n\nFor starters, you can’t always easily export those questions into an offline format, which makes it difficult to automate the response process. Additionally, web portals are often limited to a small number of users which makes it difficult for you to collaborate with subject matter experts when responding to a complex questionnaire.\n\nWith 1up’s browser extension, you can generate answers directly on any web-based questionnaire. The same great answers you get from 1up can now be instantly plugged into any webpage."
