It's made to prevent Chrome quits when you close last tab. But it's not really work as you may expect. It keeps you Chrome has at least two tabs. Because *intercepting* last tab closing is not possible without JavaScript injection into webpages, therefore this is one possible way to get around.\n\nOptions:\n\n * Automatically select newly created tab.\n * Automatically pin newly created tab when there is no pinned tabs. (v0.4.1+)\n * Automatically close New Tab tabs after opening a new tab.\n * Open custom page. (v0.5)\n * Support Chrome Sync. (v0.6)\n\nThis extension is an Open Source project, licensed under the MIT License.
