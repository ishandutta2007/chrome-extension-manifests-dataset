Now it does, thanks to Craig.Chat!\n\nCraig.Chat is a Chrome extension that seamlessly embeds a Disqus commenting thread into every Craigslist posting you visit.\n\nSee an ad that seems too good to be true? More likely than not, someone else has thought so too - check the comments to see if anyone has noticed suspicious wording, or recognized the ad to be part of a scam operation.\n\nWondering if a used car part for sale will fit your vehicle? Get feedback from the Craig.Chat community, or use Disqus's built-in \"Share\" feature to link the conversation directly on your Facebook Wall or Twitter account."
