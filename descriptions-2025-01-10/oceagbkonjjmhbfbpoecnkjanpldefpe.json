The Congree Authoring Server is scalable and thus supports the editorial work in small, medium-sized, and large enterprises.\n\nRule-Based Language Check\nApart from the spelling, grammar, and terminology, the rule-based Language Check also checks the style. Predefined rule sets cover most application cases; additional company-specific rules can be added as needed.\n\nAuthoring Memory\nThe Authoring Memory serves as a sentence repository, which shows all text segments that are similar to your text and that were written and approved in the past. You can apply these text segments with a click. New sentences are included in the Authoring Memory after they are checked and approved. Congree Data Grooming can help to maintain and improve the quality of your Authoring Memory.\n\nTerminology Component\nThe connection of third-party terminology software enables access to a wide range of information on terminology hits. The terminology component in Congree delivers definitions and usage information on specialized terms â€“ including preferred terms, admitted terms, and deprecated terms."
