By viewing Content Credentials associated with content you consume online, and depending on what the content producer chose to include, you can learn:  \n\nWho produced the content — which may include information like name, social media profiles, and websites. \nThe tools and editing methods used to produce the content, including whether generative AI was used in the process. \nDevice information, including cameras or editing software used to create and edit the content.   \n\nMake sure to pin the extension to your browser's toolbar to keep it visible as you visit different websites.\n====================================== \n\nFEATURES  \n\n⭐︎ Reliably view Content Credentials (when available) on any website. \n\n⭐︎ Customize Content Credential display preferences. \n\n⭐︎ The browser extension can read both embedded Content Credentials and invisible watermark information. \n\n====================================== \n\nABOUT \n\nContent Credentials are a new kind of tamper-evident metadata that serves as a “nutrition label” for digital content. Content Credentials can help you learn more about the content you consume online and provide you with information that can help you decide how to interpret it, whether you trust it, and how to stay more informed about it.  \n\n \n\nContent Credentials are powered by an open standard developed and maintained by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)  and the Content Authenticity Initiative — the cross-industry community building open-source tools for Content Credentials to create a more open and transparent internet. \n\n====================================== \n\n NOTES \n\nSupport: For help with questions, suggestions, or problems, visit https://www.adobe.com/go/helpx-contentauth-extension"
