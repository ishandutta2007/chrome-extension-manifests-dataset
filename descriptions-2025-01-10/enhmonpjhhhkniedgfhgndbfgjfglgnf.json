Freaked out by the prospect of the UK government triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty? Then install Execute Article 50!, which replaces all instances of the phrase \"trigger Article 50\" with \"execute Order 66\", and \"EU\" with \"Galactic Empire\". As a bonus, all the main political players are given their proper titles (e.g. Grand Moff Gove).\n\nSometimes reading news about the British EU referendum makes it seem like the galaxy is on the brink of destruction. Thanks to Execute Article 50!, it is!\n\n(Regardless of what it says when you install this extension, I can't see any of your browsing data.)"
