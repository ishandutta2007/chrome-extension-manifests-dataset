When activated, this extension deletes selected text on a website, calls the OpenAI API for a translated version, then places the new text in the original text's place. Elucidate will generally complete a translation within a few seconds, however, the translation time will increase roughly linearly with the length of the selected text. We anticipate three main use cases for this extension:\n\n1. To convert pieces of text to more approachable versions for those developing their reading skills.\n2. To covert technically-dense passages into more generally accessible translations.\n3. To facilitate learning another language by enabling a user to practice reading text in their target language at a comfortable reading level.\n\nThis project represents a continuation of our submission to the Duke Generative AI Hackathon (https://devpost.com/software/elucidate-ycvbs5).\n\nUsage\n\n1. Pin the Elucidate extension to the Chrome bookmarks bar.\n2. Click on the Elucidate logo in the bookmarks bar to toggle the visibility of the Elucidate UI.\n3. The Elucidate logo should be visible on the bottom left corner of the Chrome Window. Click on the logo to access the Elucidate UI.\n4. Highlight a selection of text you would like to translate.\n5. Choose a desired language and reading level in the UI.\n6. Click \"Translate Text\", wait a moment, and the translation should soon appear in the selected text's place."
