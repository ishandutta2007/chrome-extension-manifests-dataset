Goal is to provide wake-up reminder for users who spend working at PC or simply want to be reminded that they have to to something.\n\nApp 2.0.0 version is an update of an old one, technically a complete rebuild of the app. Chrome has changed its capabilities - meaning that from 2023 this app will stop working without another update. Playing sound from Chrome has never been harder."
