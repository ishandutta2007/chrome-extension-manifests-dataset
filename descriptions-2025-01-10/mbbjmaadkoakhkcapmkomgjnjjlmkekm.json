With TextLinks, a short text string sends you to your most important URLs without taking your fingers off the keyboard!\n\nTo use this extension, click the 'TextLinks' icon in your extensions menu, enter keyword and url combinations. In the URL bar, type \"go\" + spacebar (or TAB), your keyword of choice, and press enter!\n\nOther extensions charge you for similar functionality, but TextLinks will always be free for as many links as you want to store.\n\nDetailed Setup:\n\n1. Install the TextLinks extension\n2. Click the extension icon at the top right of Chrome (i.e., the \"puzzle piece\"), and pin TextLinks to your extensions pane\n3. Click the TextLinks logo, and add your URL pairs (e.g., \"goog\" and \"google.com\")\n\nDetailed Usage:\n\n1. Go to the URL bar (Ctrl + L to keep hands on the keyboard)\n2. Type \"go\" followed by either spacebar or TAB to enter the TextLinks omnibox\n3. Type the short string you've set up and press enter!\n\n(Optional) Say goodbye to your bookmarks bar:\n\nIf you prefer this text linking approach, you can clear up some visual space in your browser by hiding your bookmarks bar. Click on the elipses on the top right > settings > Appearance > Show bookmarks bar."
