Keep track of the time you spend on the web, writing code, playing games, or even reading a book. Clocker allows you to do all of these things! Clocker also sends desktop notifications to users after an hour (by default) has passed, alerting them to take a break. Break notifications can be adjusted to be sent every hour (by default), two hours, or three hours. This concept is based on the Pomodoro Technique, which states that frequent breaks can increase mental agility.\n\nUse: to start a session, simply click main button. The timer will run in the background, even if Google Chrome is closed. Notifications will be sent at the specified time intervals. To stop the timer, either click on the desktop notification or click the main button again. Immediately after ending a session, you will see the session time added to your weekly time spent metric, as well as the all-time spent metric.\n\nI credit Artur Stolear for helping develop this Chrome extension."
