Peach is cool. :)\n\n*LIMITATION* it has been reported that the popins doesn't display properly on osx because they make the extension close itself. Those popins appear for example when trying to add a friend. To use those features, just go on the main website, at http://nectarine.rocks/ . This is the webapp that is loaded in this extension, so you won't have to log in again if you're already logged in from the extension."
