Helping your productivity, 1 click at a time.\n\nApp website: https://www.rename-email.com/\ncloudHQ website: https://www.cloudhq.net\nPricing: https://www.rename-email.com/pricing\nSupport page: https://support.cloudhq.net/category/browser-extensions/gmail_rename_email\nBlog: https://blog.cloudhq.net\n\nGmail, Google Calendar, and  Google Workspace are trademarks of Google LLC.
