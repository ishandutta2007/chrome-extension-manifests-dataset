Unlike ad blockers, this extension fully complies with YouTube’s Terms of Service, which prohibits ad blocking. Instead of blocking ads, the extension either shows the skip button when it's typically hidden or pushes the ad to the end, allowing the skip button to become active.\n\nHow It Works:\nSkip Button Availability: The extension ensures that the \"Skip\" button becomes available for you to press, even if there is a wait timer that would typically delay its appearance. It does not bypass or block ads but makes the button accessible as soon as it's available.\n\nAd Skip Feature: If the skip button isn't immediately available due to a timer, the extension provides a separate button that allows you to skip the ad to its end. This action will bring you to YouTube's static ad page, where the regular skip button will appear. You can then press the official YouTube skip button to move past the ad instead of watching it in full.\n\nNote: This extension offers convenience while adhering to YouTube’s Terms of Service by avoiding any form of ad blocking. It provides users with faster access to the skip button, giving them more control over the viewing experience without disrupting YouTube’s ad ecosystem.\nThis gives you freedom over your viewing experience without violating YouTube’s rules. The extension runs locally within your browser and does not collect any user data, ensuring your privacy while improving usability."
