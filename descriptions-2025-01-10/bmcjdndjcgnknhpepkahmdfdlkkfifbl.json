If you're not worried about citing your sources, the references may be unnecessary clutter - especially in plain text, where they're bigger and can't act as hyperlinks. Maybe you'd rather have something like this:\n\nMultiple researchers all reported instances of coyotes killing bobcats, whereas bobcats killing coyotes is more rare.\n\nThat's where this extension comes in. There are two ways to use it:\n* Select text, right-click, and choose \"Copy without notes\".\n* Select text and use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+X.\n\nThat's it! You can still perform regular copying as you usually would. WikiCopy can be used on any site, but it's fine-tuned for Wikipedia.\n\nIf the keyboard shortcut doesn't work for you, it may be because Ctrl+X is already taken by something else. There's an easy fix:\n1) Navigate to chrome://extensions in your address bar.\n2) Scroll down if necessary, and click \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" in the bottom-right.\n3) Choose any key combination you like!\n\nIf you have a moment, please rate, review, or contact me directly through the support tab. I look forward to hearing from you!"
