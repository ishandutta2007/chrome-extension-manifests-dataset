It is still functional on old.reddit.com*\n\nTired of only Reddit's top sort only using the last hour/day/week/month/year? With Custom Top Sort you can get the top posts from the last three days, 21 hours, 7 months or whatever you want!\n\nCustom top sort works with both old Reddit and the redesign.\n\nNote: Due to this extension using Reddit's default sort and then removing old posts that are too old, the result will be quite empty when the time interval uses small numbers. E.g. top posts from the last 2 hours will yield almost no results. It will fetch posts from the last day and filter posts that are 2-24 hours old, which vastly outnumber the 0-2 hour ones, and will remove virtually every post."
