Press command/control-k to open the list of tabs, type to filter the tabs, press enter to select one.\n\nThis solves two problems:\n- you can pop over to a particular tab just by knowing its name. Lost your Gmail tab in ten windows with twelve tabs each? No problem: Just press command-k and type some of the name of the tab.\n- you can easily bounce between two tabs, the way that you can alt-tab between apps: command-k, enter.\n\nVersion 2013.9.21 fixes bugs with full-screen windows and with not bringing a window to the front when switching tabs (apparently because of a change in Chrome's behavior) and removes the toolbar button. Now the keyboard shortcut is the only way to use PowerSwitch.\n\nVersion 2013.4.2 fixes a bug that caused the list of tabs to be empty after loading certain kinds of tabs.\n\n(PowerSwitch is similar to Emacs' iswitchb and also to the Recent Files UI in IntelliJ.)"
