(click the eye patch icon to see.)\n\nNew feature in v0.3: after you pass the problem, Acceptance Rate and Difficulty level will show right below the \"Accepted\" text to add extra satisfaction when finishing a problem and seeing it was actually hard. Suggested by Chryscord from reddit.\n\nGithub url: https://github.com/Nevvea7/eyepatch  Feel free to contribute in any way!"
