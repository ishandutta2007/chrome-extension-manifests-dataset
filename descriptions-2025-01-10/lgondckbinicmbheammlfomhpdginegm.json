Also this version adds queues to the downloads instead of downloading them all at once, also because of the way chrome has changed.\nVersion 1.1 - Removes the need to add your own proxies, it now collects them automatically.\nVersion 1.3 - Changes yet again as Chrome has changed a lot of their rules, such as the dialogue popping up every time you want to open a magnet link. This update adds a queue that you have to manually continue. My apologies but it appears to be the only way to bypass this.\nVersion 1.4 - Now adds the option to use the newly replaced option to allow links to be opened automatically again, allowing you to download in bulk.\nVersion 1.6 - Moved away from ETTV as they were down for a while, now we are using Zooqle, it's faster too as they have the magnet links there on the search result table.\nVersion 1.8 - Now using an API which uses a few torrent sites for the links. There may be still be a few bugs going forward but I will try to keep on top of them.\nVersion 1.8.1 - Had to remove the link to Episode Calendar from clicking the extensions icon. As this is no longer permitted.\nVersion 1.9.0 - The place I was getting the torrents from changed the url, this has now been fixed. Also updated to manifest v3."
