However, I changed the environment where the PIP mode is played to Youtube only.\n\nFirst of all, you can toggle PIP mode on and off by pressing Alt + P or clicking the extension in the Chrome browser tab where the Youtube video is playing, and you can toggle it on and off by pressing the Alt + P shortcut in other Chrome browser tabs.\n\nThis also works for tabs in a new Chrome browser, not just tabs in the same Chrome browser.\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/VVSOGI/picture-in-picture-from-korea\n\n2024.11.27 Add platform chzzk\n\nThis is really good, so if you can't use it, please contact me for help. I'll message you and if I'm not sure, we can also talk on discord.\n\nvvsogi@gmail.com"
