I know other similar extensions like this exist but I was concerned about their privacy and a lot of them seem to have frills. So I made one that was as readable and as lightweight as I felt I could get away with so even a user unfamiliar with programming could be sure no shenanigans are going on.\n\nButton Functionality:\n\nSave and Close: saves and closes tabs open in the current window. In interests of privacy any instance of extension only has access to a single window.\n\nRestore All: Restores all tabs saved in History, but does not remove them from the history.\n\nRestore and Remove All: Restores all the tabs saved in history and removes them from the history.\n\nRemove All: Removes all tabs from the history without restoring them.\n\nUndo Remove All: For a period of time after you deleted the history you can still restore it.\n\n\"Printable Version\" checkbox: transforms clickable URLs into text web addresses in case you want to back up the tabs you had open by copy-pasting it in a notepad or similar."
