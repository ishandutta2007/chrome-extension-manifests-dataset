If you have not collected the item, it will display a red exclamation mark next to the item name.  Items that are bought from the store that you cannot collect will show a yellow $ icon to denote that the item could/should be quick sold.\n\n\n- **Important for first time setup**: Any time you go to your collections page (items and collectibles), the extension will read the page for item names and add them to the internal storage for which items you have.  In this regard, I recommend going through all the pages on your collection tab (items and collectibles) after installing the extension to generate a list of what you already have.\n\n- This extension works on any page that shows your inventory (i.e.  Market, Dumping Grounds, and of course inventory itself)\n- Items you add to your collection will automatically be updated.\n- There is a default list of items that are bought from the store.  If the extension ever finds an item that is store bought and can't be collected, it will add it to it's internal list and you won't see\n- No icons will be displayed for items that have no collection status (i.e. materials, potions, food)\n\n- In the popup (clicking on the extension icon on taskbar or in extension dropdown), you can set a quicksell threshold limit for all items.  Setting this will make any item that quick sells more then the entered amount show a yellow $ icon instead of the green/red icon.\n- In the same popup, you can import and export your current lists.  Exported lists save as .csv files so you can easily use this in Excel.  For importing lists, you can select the .csv that was created by extension or you can make it yourself (start with \"ItemList\" in A1 and then each A row after that, add an item name)."
