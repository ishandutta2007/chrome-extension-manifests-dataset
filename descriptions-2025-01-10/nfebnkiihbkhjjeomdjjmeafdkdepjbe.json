Quickfix is a really easy way to edit CSS in Google Chrome. It automatically saves your fix per domain and you can easily toggle the fix on and off.\n\nPerfect for fixing layout bugs really quickly. Never wait for the next deploy cycle to get your changes out there. Edit your site in realtime.\n\nThe idea was born out of frustration from having worked with a UX/UI team that were eager to fix the over all styling of a big project. It took way too much time to implement the fixes and foremost discussing the changes, so instead the team was handed Quickfix to change the appearance them selfs. A major success for the project and the look and feel of it - all thanks to the Quickfix CSS editor."
