Where can I see the source code?\nRight Here: https://github.com/TheGuyWithTheFace/Redirectron\n\n2. Why on earth do you need the \"tabs\" permission?\nOddly enough, it's required for the keyboard shortcut. Think I'm doing something wrong? Have a look in the source code!\n\n3. Who made that fancy icon?\nAlas, not I. A friend of mine, Kevin Rabinovich, is a designer, here's his site: http://kevinrabinovich.me/\n\nDISCLAIMER: You and you only are responsible for your actions when using this extension. If you get in trouble, that's your fault-don't come crying to me."
