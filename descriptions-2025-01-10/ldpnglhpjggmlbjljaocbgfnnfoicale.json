You will need to get our NFT on OpenSea https://opensea.io/collection/whaletogether - then join our discord and verify that you're a holder.\n\nOur current features you’ll get access to are:\n\n​​✅ Rarity rankings - Fetch the rarity/ranking of the whole collection with the click of a button.\n\n​​✅ Top traits/properties - See ownership % of that NFTs’ top property while browsing the collection or activity page.\n\n​​✅ Quick buy button - Click our buy button on collection or activity page. This then opens MetaMask for you to confirm the transaction. No need to click multiple times before being able to buy the NFT.\n\n✅ Gas preset - Set a gas preset for priority + amount of gas you’re willing to pay. This preset is for the “quick buy button” above, which helps you snipe NFTs before someone else does from the activity page, for example, if you set a slightly high gas preset.\n\n​​✅ Contract ninja - Enter the collection’s contract address + number of NFTs + price of NFTs to buy directly from the contract. The value of this is in that you can buy directly from the contract if the collection’s website is down/under attack, etc. It can also help mint more quickly than buying on an overloaded website. \n\n​​✅ Gas tracker - See live gas prices directly in the extension's widget without you needing to go on yet another website.\n\nMore features are currently in the works which will revolutionize even more the way you purchase NFTs. Some of these features are:\n\n- Mass bidding.\n- Batch listing.\n- Watch bot.\n- Smart filtering on OpenSea.\nAnd more (we don’t want to reveal everything just yet!)\n\nFeel free to read more on:\nhttps://whaletogether.gitbook.io/whale-paper/"
