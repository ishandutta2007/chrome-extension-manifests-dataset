This is what happens: when you are on the website Zalando.com you will every other minute get a notification from your website. The notification is a link to Sellpy.com with the same category that you were looking at on Zalando.com. If you're looking for \"Nike shoes\" on Zalando.com, the notification will give you a link to \"Nike shoes\" on Sellpy.com. The reason for this is to remind users that they can shop second hand from Sellpy istead of buying newly produced from Zalando. The production of the raw materials required to manufacture new garments is very water- and energy-intensive and leads to emissions. This extension is for users who want to reduce their consumption of newly produced garments and need a reminder to shop more sustainably."
