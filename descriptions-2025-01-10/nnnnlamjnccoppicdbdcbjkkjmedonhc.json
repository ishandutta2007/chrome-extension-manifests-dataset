The past is marked with skull emoji, and the future with a rose emoji. \n\nI chose the symbolisms of clock, skull, and rose, to represent time, death, and life, respectively. This symbolism is not arbitrary but have a history. For instance, can be seen in Phillippe de Champaigne's vanitas.\n\nHopefully, with the reminder, you will remain focused on whatever you need to do, and keep that productivity up! Carpe diem! \n\nYou will be asked for your birthday on first use, in order to properly visualize your life. It is only stored locally. \n\nYou can also select the time unit you want to use (days/weeks/months/years). \n\nYou can enter the age expectancy in years as appropriate for youself\n\nThe settings page can be accessed by clicking on the extension's icon."
