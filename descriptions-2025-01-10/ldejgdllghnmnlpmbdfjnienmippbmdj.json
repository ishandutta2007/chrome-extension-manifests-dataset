Viz Tab creates a visual snapshot of all your open tabs so that they can be easily organized and recalled later with just one click.\n\nIdeal for users who need several tabs open based on a specific project or interest. With Viz Tab you can open a full browsing session organized by project, group, or subject in seconds, instead of wasting time searching through bookmarks and visited sites to recreate a session.\n\nViz Tab can also be set as the default home page that opens whenever a new tab is opened. Categories and pages can quickly be renamed to make organizing even easier."
