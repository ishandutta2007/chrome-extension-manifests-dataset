Earning fish eggs is simple - spend enough time on a popular site and you will eventually unlock a unique fish. Your fish will grow over time without needing food or care, happy to swim around the dynamic aquarium in your browser.\n\nI hope you enjoy using this browser extension - as an independent developer, I had a blast creating each fish from scratch based on the world's favorite websites, and I'm always coming up with new ones to add to the game. I hope you have fun watching your fish tank grow as you continue to browse the web!\n\nPrivacy notice: your browsing activity is occasionally sampled in order to generate unique fish for you - it is not collected by me or anyone else."
