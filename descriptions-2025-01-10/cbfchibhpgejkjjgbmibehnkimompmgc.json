Your positive feedback and reviews have confirmed that Parsley has provided significant value to our industry. We created this service to enhance the community that has embraced StaffUpApp (staffupapp.com) and has given us hope for a bright future.\n\nI understand that experiencing a service shutdown is inconvenient, and I assure you this decision was not made lightly.\n\nPlease note the following important details:\n\n* Support emails will be answered through March 15th, 2025. After this date, we will no longer be able to respond, and access to the site will be disabled.\n\n* Subscribers will be charged for January and February, but no fees will be applied in March.\n\nIf you have further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me at rick@getparsley.net, and Iâ€™ll do my best to reply.\n\nThank you again for your support and understanding during this challenging time.\n\nBest,\nRick Richard\nFounder, Parsley\n\n========================\n\nA good sourcing tool should feel effortless.
