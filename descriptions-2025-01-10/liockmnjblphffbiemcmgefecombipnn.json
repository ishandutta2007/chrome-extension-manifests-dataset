When you install the newTAB chrome extension, ads will be displayed every time you open a new tab. As time goes on, the amount you earn adds up resulting in true passive income.\n\nYou can use these funds to donate to a wide range of charities. As of now, the charities we support are:\n- Water.org\n- Rainforest Trust\n- Eden Reforestation Projects\n- Scholarship America\n- African Wildlife Foundation\n- United Way\n- PRASAD Project\n- Sankara Eye Foundation\n- Breast Cancer Research Foundation\n\nnewTAB places a large emphasis on the environment. That's why, alongside numerous green charities, we also support searching with Ecosia, a search engine that plants trees with its profits. If you use Ecosia, you'll be able to see personal stats such as KGs of carbon sequestered and # of trees planted."
