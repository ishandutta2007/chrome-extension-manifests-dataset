Quizzes that don't have an associated gradebook entry will not auto-populate (they don't affect the score)\n\nAre you tired of opening two windows just so that you can see what you've answered in the previous quiz attempt? Well, I understand. It gets even worse when you have multiple submissions that need to be combined into one. \n\nCanvas Quiz Loader has been built to solve this common problem. It scans your previous submissions, picks out correct answers, and automatically applies them to the current attempt. \n\n==============================================\nCurrently supported question types:\n   - Multiple Choice\n   - True/False\n   - Fill In The Blank\n   - Multiple Answer\n   - Matching\n   - Numerical Answer\n   - Formula Question*\n   - Essay Question\n\n* If formula or variables within the formula change, the answer might have to be changed as well. \n==============================================\n\n\nAcknowledgment \nIcon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com"
