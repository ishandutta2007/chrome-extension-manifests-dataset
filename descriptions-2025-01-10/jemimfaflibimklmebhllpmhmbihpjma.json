System dark mode following, lockable to a different time zone, cool font choices, and analog face option! What more could you ask for?\n\nðŸ•¤ Why would you need it? \nWorking in your browser in full-screen mode is great, but then on both Windows and Mac, the system clock is hidden. Icon Clock lets you place an easy to read time right in the browser toolbar. Additionally, analog mode is quietly informative without being too jangly.\n\nðŸ•¤ How do you use it?\n1. After installation, pin the extension icon using the puzzle-piece icon in the address bar.\n2. Drag Icon Clock to where you like it in the toolbar.\n3. Click on the icon to open preferences.\n4. If you want the face to automatically reverse contrast when your system changes to dark theme, select \"follow system theme.\" \n5. If you use custom colors inside chrome, you can force dark mode on it its' better for your theme. Also try adding a contrasting background behind the numbers.\n6. If you want to track time in another part of the world, you can set the clock to any zone you like. By default it follows whatever your system is using. \n7. Don't like AM/PM time? Use the 24 hr time option. \n8. Don't need up to the minute? For a low-key glanceable \"about four\" update, try the analog face. Soothing and zen.\n9. Click Buy Us a Cup of Rocket Fuel to support extension development!\n\nðŸ•¤ Is this extension safe? \nThis extension does not ask for unnecessary permissions. It doesn't track you. It doesn't save any information about you. You can right click on the extension icon in your toolbar, to see exactly what information it can read from your browser. You can read our detailed terms of use and privacy policy here: https://garagerocket.com/terms/privacy-extensions/\n\nðŸ•¤ What is the use license for this extension?\nCopyright 2024 Garage Rocket, all rights reserved. Use and enjoy, but please don't copy, redistribute or monetize.\n\nðŸ•¤ How can I get more info about the extension?\nFAQ, privacy policy, terms of use, the ability to donate to support development: https://garagerocket.com/extensions/iconclock\n\nðŸ•¤ What if I find a bug or have a feature request?\nWe are grateful for ideas and suggestions! If you run into issues, please leave a bug report instead of a negative review. We use Chrome Web Store's built-in support portal, near the bottom of this page.\n\nðŸ•¤ What's on the roadmap?\n- On-page clock overlay: it might be nice to have a bigger easy to read but translucent analog or digital clock overlaid on every page. Also, it could optionally provide back-to-top and reading progress functionality too, just like our Top Rocket extension. Or is that crossing the streams? What do you think? Leave a comment in the support section of the extension's page in the chrome web store.\n- Remove custom font files: they are overkill when we only use 0-9 numerals. Instead use exported SVGs for each numeral, for each font option. This will make the extension smaller, simpler, faster and less resource intensive.\nðŸ•¤ What's changed in this release?\n1.1.0: Swapped out one font due to licensing restrictions, and one font for performance reasons. Removed font previews from the popup, slowed everything down too much. Added version info to popup.\n1.0.1: Fixes three small bugs: sometimes user prefs are not saving correctly; sometimes force dark mode and follow system dark are not mutually exclusive; sometimes the time is out of date for a minute on system wake from sleep.\n1.0.0: Adds a timezone reminder, with time and date clarification, in the action icon's hover tooltip. Calling this feature complete.\n0.0.5: Minor fix: broken image path for one of the popup example images.\n0.0.3: Added an analog clock face option. Corrected FAQ and privacy notifications to reflect that this extension does no tracking of any kind, ever.\n0.0.2: initial public release includes 24hr time or AM/PM, auto follow of system dark mode, three cool fonts, manual time zone override."
