You'll no longer see ads, promoted tweets, \"Discover more\" tweets, \"Who to follow\" tweets, and other unwanted content. The \"Trending\" section is hidden by default, but you can  change this on the options page. Unlike other similar extensions this one doesn't rely on you scrolling to block dynamic ads. Instead, it hides them the moment they're added to the page, so you won't even notice them. \n\nIf you want to say thank you (ha-ha, I know you don't), feel free to buy me a coffee https://buymeacoffee.com/arrr.\n\nSupported languages: English."
