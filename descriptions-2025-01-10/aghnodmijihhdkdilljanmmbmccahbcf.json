If you wish to seed servers till the population is higher simply multiply the value you want it to stop seeding at e.g stop at 40 enter 80. If you don't want to seed the server at all just enter 0.\n\nThe reset button can be used to remove all your settings, this can be useful when you add or remove servers from/to your favorites.\n\nFeedback is always appreciated. :]"
