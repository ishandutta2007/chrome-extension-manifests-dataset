Who reads /r/nosleep anyway? Get rid of unwanted content by clicking on the 'Hide' button next to each post or block an entire subreddit from showing up by clicking 'Block sub'. Install this plugin to clear up the clutter and start consuming fresh content today!\n\nWith this plugin, you get a link next to each post for hiding, and a button next to each sub for blocking. In addition to stats about how many posts you've hidden, you'll also get a seamless interface at the top of the page that lets you: \n- Hide all the links on the current page.\n- Temporarily see the links that have been hidden on the current page.\n- Unblock all the subs you've blocked.\n- Reset the extension, making everything become visible again.\n\nFAQ:\nYes, you can use it while logged out of Reddit (intended usage).\nNo, it does not sync with your phone.\nNo, it does not work with Incognito mode.\nYes, you should provide feedback about this extension.\nNo, your hidden links are not tracked.\n\nContributions are welcome! The Riddit source code is currently hosted on github:\n\nhttps://github.com/maximusdominus/riddit\n\nNote: up to 200,000 links can be hidden at any time, any additional hidden link will cause the oldest ones to be shown again. This is due to browser memory limitations."
