Doom element let's you remove DOM elements by clicking them while pressing ctrl+alt on Window and Linux and cmd+option on Mac. It also keeps track of elements recently removed so that they can be restored by pressing ctrl+z (cmd+z on mac). \n\nThe changes are not permanent: reload the page and it's back to normal.\n\nIt's a just a few lines of code that you're welcome to have a look at (see the website).\n\nNote: doom element respects the content security policy of websites so it won't load any sound effects on websites that disallow it (eg. duckduckgo, twitter)\n\n1.1.7: issue with scrollable body after shooting modal\n1.1.6: unwanted log messages. fix of undo inline style for body and html tag.\n1.1.5: suppress other click and mousedown events while aiming\n1.1.4: fix cmd+z on macos."
