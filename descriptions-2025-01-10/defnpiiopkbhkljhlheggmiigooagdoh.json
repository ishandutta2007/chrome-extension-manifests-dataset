Is a page indexable?\n2. What would that page look like in Google?\n\nIt uses traffic lights on the left hand side of the page and a pop-up to show you this.\n\nYou can see the screenshots for example of what this creates above. It's excellent for general awareness while browsing as well as raising awareness of SEO problems if it's installed on a wider team. (For example getting people to pay attention to what pages might look like in Google.)\n\nTo generate this information it looks at canonical in the page and headers, robots tags in the page and headers and the robots.txt file.\n\n- You can customise the traffic lights\n- You can customise the domains it appears on\n- You can toggle it on and off with a shortcut"
