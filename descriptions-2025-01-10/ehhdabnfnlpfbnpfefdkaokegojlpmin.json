Posts you've liked will be colored blue and posts you haven't liked will be colored orange for easy differentiating.\n\nSome sponsored posts will show in red.  Sponsored posts that have been liked by one of your friends currently show up in orange, but this will be fixed in a future version.\n\nAs you scroll down the page and more posts are displayed, Likey will automatically color them in blue, orange, or red (as applicable).  If you refresh the page or go to another Facebook page, you'll need to click the Likey button again to run it on that page.\n\nIf you discover any bugs, please leave a detailed comment so the issue can be addressed.  Suggestions always welcome!"
