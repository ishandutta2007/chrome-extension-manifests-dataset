Hereâ€™s how it works:\n\nOpen the LinkedIn Profile: Start by navigating to the LinkedIn profile of a candidate you're interested in.\n\nPaste the Job Description: Copy the job description for the position you are hiring for and paste it into the designated area in the extension.\n\nClick 'Match Profiles': Once the job description is pasted, click on the 'Match Profiles' button to initiate the analysis.\n\nReceive Match Rating: The extension will then process the information and provide a match rating for the candidate. The ratings are categorized as:\n\nLow Match: Indicates that the candidate's profile has few qualifications or skills that align with the job description.\n\nMid Match: Suggests that the candidate has a moderate alignment with the job requirements.\nHigh Match: Signifies that the candidate's profile strongly aligns with the job description, indicating they are potentially a good fit for the role.\n\nWhen a profile is rated as a \"High Match,\" it implies that the candidate is likely well-suited for the position based on the job description provided."
