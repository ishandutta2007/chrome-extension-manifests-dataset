They could potentially stole them.\n- They could very easily store your cookies and access, on your behalf, all your apps, emails, bank accounts, from remote servers.\n\nWhile monitoring the activity of certain popular extensions like Hola Internet , counting 9 millions users (don't install !), we found that certain Extensions are visiting websites on our behalf, in the background of our browsers, without our explicit consent.\n\n                     FREAKY ISN'T IT ? \n\nThen we found that 80% of extension's developers don't have websites or don't have a support email or are hiding their personal data behind anonymous services. Many are located in countries where data privacy is not a concern. \n​\nSo, it is time to take control on your extensions."
