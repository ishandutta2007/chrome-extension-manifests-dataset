These bots often post unrelated content, making it difficult to find comments related to the original tweet.\n\nTo address this, I began muting these accounts, which significantly improved my experience when reading comments. However, some farm accounts still slipped through. By using this extension to mute these accounts, you'll see far fewer farm bots, enhancing your experience and helping other users enjoy a cleaner comment section as well.\n\nFor more information, access the source code here: https://github.com/pedrolzoliveira/mute-bot-twitter-x\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to message me on Twitter/X: https://x.com/PedrolzOliveira"
