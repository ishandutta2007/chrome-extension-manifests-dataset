But like many of us, I struggle with having too many Chrome tabs open, often losing track of my Claude conversation.\n\nI created this simple sidebar extension to solve my own problem, and I hope it helps other engineers too. It lets you quickly pull up Claude whenever you need it and hide it when you're done - no more searching through tabs!\n\nWhile it's a humble solution, it's made my workflow much smoother, especially when I need quick help with:\n🔥 Reviewing code\n🔥 Looking over design docs\n🔥 Writing code snippets and unit tests\n🔥 Creating bash scripts, or SQL queries\n🔥 Fixing LaTeX!!\n\nI'm sharing this with fellow engineers who might face the same challenges. It's nothing fancy, but I hope you find it as useful as I do in your daily work.\n\n---------\n💻 How to get started:\n🔸Click the \"Add to Chrome\" button and pin it to your toolbar.\n🔸Go to https://snapanswer.io\n🔸Use Google auth to sign up for a free account.\n🔸Start using the sidebar!\n\n📪 If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact us at hi@snapanswer.io - I'd love to hear from you and make this extension better together!"
