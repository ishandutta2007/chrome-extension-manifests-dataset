You can jump right into the discussion if the the link has already been submitted. Otherwise a \"Submit this link\" is provided for a link to reddit submission page. \n\nThis extension will save you some time if you are about to repost a link. Also this extension is a quick way to check for reddit's comments on a blog or article.\n\n** UPDATE 0.8\n1. Cache results to reduce network overhead\n2. Bug fixes: Sometimes, clicking the button opened the submission page even when there were results.\n\n** UPDATE 0.7\nUI Improvements\n\n** UPDATE 0.6\nAdded Blacklist on Options page to not run Reddit Check on certain websites. For example, you may not want Reddit-Check to run on your company's internal website or your bank's website. You can add these to your blacklist.\nAdding \"bank\" will stop Reddit Check from running on any URL containing \"bank\".\n\n** UPDATE 0.5\n1. For youtube, check the url without '&feature=' and '&context='. Also do https + http.\n\n\n** UPDATE 0.4\n1. Better design\n2. Show reddit post count on each tab in icon\n\nThanks for the feedback!\n\n\nSource: http://github.com/hsbakshi/reddit-check\n\nContributers: Akshay Anand (https://github.com/xaksis)\n(https://github.com/ggPeti)\n\nIcons: http://satedproductions.com/\n\nSome ideas from Paul Burton (Better Reddit Check)\n\nFor giving feedback or for support leave comments below."
