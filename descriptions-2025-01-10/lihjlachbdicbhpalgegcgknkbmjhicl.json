The concept behind ATbar is simple: One toolbar to provide all of the functionality you would usually achieve through the use of different settings or products.\n\nATbar is free and allows you to change the look and feel of webpages, have text read aloud and spell check forms. It is a simple tool which is available for most popular browsers. There are three versions of the ATbar toolbar."
