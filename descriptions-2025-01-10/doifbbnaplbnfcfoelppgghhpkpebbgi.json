Therefore, copying LGTM images from other sites is very time consuming. However, without images, it would be very bleak. This extension solves that.Second, a review batch can be quickly posted to clearly communicate the intent of the review to the implementer. This allows for quick and accurate codereview.The two uses are quite simple. Just you can fix this extension and solve it by pressing that button. If you need help, we have a help page with English text."
