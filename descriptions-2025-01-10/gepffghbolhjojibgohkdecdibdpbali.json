You can now create a floating window out of any part of a website. Create your own floating widgets, which always stay on top of other windows.\n\nAfter installing the extension, simply click on the extension icon, and select the part of the page you want to open in a floating window.\n\nExample:\n- Weather widget\n- Video game\n- Chat window\n- Stocks ticker\n\nNotes:\n- Might not work correctly some parts of some webpages, as this depends on implementation of source webpage\n- This extension is not affiliated in any way with webpages in screenshots\n- Some pages work better when first viewed in mobile view (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode)\n\nThis extension is open source, and its source code can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/MKaandorp/anyPiP)."
