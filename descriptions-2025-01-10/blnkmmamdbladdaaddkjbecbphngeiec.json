Create a room or join an existing one to participate in group discussions, send direct messages, and share files privately. Your data can't be seen by anyone except yourself and the people you invite to your room.\n\nPlease note: Cryptodog is experimental software that may have vulnerabilities. Don't use Cryptodog if you have a critical need for secure messaging. If you decide to use it, please follow these safety recommendations:\n\n* Install the Chrome extension to ensure you always have the official, most up-to-date version.\n\n* Choose a room name that's hard to guess, and only share it with trusted people. Try clicking the dice icon to generate a random room name.\n\n* Nicknames are currently not encrypted end-to-end. For now, please don't use your full name or anything that personally identifies you."
