This extension creates a\nnew window with the same properties as the closing one when this happens. You\nmight get a flicker, but the perceived effect will be that a new tab replaces\nthe closed one.\n\nAs there is neither a way to capture the window properties while the tab is\nclosing nor an event that informs about updates to the properties, they are\ncached whenever the focus of the window or a tab changes (which includes\ncreating new windows and tabs).\n\nThis extension only works if the `Continue running background apps when\nChromium is closed` setting (under `Advanced`) is enabled (it is by default).\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nXFCE: The properties of non-maximized windows given by Chrome are incorrect as\nthey do not account for border and title bar. This results in a displacement\nwhen the window is re-created.\n\nFeedback\n--------\n\nYou can report bugs or make feature requests on\nhttps://github.com/sblask/webextension-do-not-close-browser-with-last-tab\n\nPatches are welcome."
