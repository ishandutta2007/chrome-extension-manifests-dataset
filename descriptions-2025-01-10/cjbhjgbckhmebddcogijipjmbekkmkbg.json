With this extension, you can greatly cut down on the amount of work required with just a simple click of a button, and then a random email signature is generated and pasted into your inbox for you!\n\nAdditionally, this extension comes pre-loaded with a handful of experimental email signatures ready for use, taken from this Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/NateMJensen/status/1575231032357715968. But if desired, users can save and use their custom signatures.\n\nNote: This extension is primarily designed for Gmail. Performance may vary on other email platforms."
