When ever you visit the source host, the Host header is modified to the mapped virtual host. If you try to directly visit the virtual host, you will be redirected to the source host.\n\nUsing the extension, you can access any site on multi-site host without making any DNS changes (local or otherwise). This is perfect for use cases where you have an IIS server running hosting multiple sites and you want to access one of them. This is also great for accessing and viewing other machine's sites which can be great in a collaborative environment where you want to see the exact state of another machine. An example of this is a project manager, QA tester, or another dev being able to view another worker's progress directly. Good for testing, debugging, and comparing changes.\n\nThis extension supports configuring a global preset list which is used by default when the extension is turned on. You can also limit the extension to only work on tab you explicitly enable using the extension icon in the toolbar for each app. You can use a combination of these features by using tab overrides without enabled the tab sandbox option in the options page.\n\n========================== v0.0.0.3 ================================\nThe source host is grouped and allows you to open all of the virtual hosts for a given source host group. This will open a new tab for each virtual host entry. This makes it easy to view all of the sites (virtual hosts) on a given machine (source host)."
