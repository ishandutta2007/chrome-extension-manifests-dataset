Open a new tab in Chrome and you'll know right away.\n\nRed color indicates beer is currently not on sale. Orange means the sale either begins or ends within 15 minutes. Green means the sale is on!\n\nThis is an open source project built with ReactJS. Feel free to check out its Github page and contribute!"
