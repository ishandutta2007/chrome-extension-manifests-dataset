Well, now you can do something about it!\nWith Polygon Modulator, you can just add that user to your list of blocked users. You won't see their comments in the thread, and new comments will be picked out as you go.\nBetter yet, you won't have any way to respond to that user (just in case you are tempted).\n\nThis product was developed on my own initiative, but does not conflict with the Polygon Community Guidelines. You are only affecting what you see in your browser."
