Also this will allow you to ship up to 100 orders in under 5 minutes. Simply check the order item you want to work on scroll up and click \"select all\" and the extension will find every order for that specific item. If you check an order with a quantity of one it will only locate the orders with one, if you have orders with multiples it will only locate those orders.\n\nOur Amazon bulk shipping automation tool allows you to ship your FBM orders in a fast and more efficient way. We believe by creating this powerful shipping extension this will allow your business to allocate more time towards product research which will help your bottom line versus spending unnecessary time on shipping.\n\nOn the final shipping page we've also created another option that allows you to change all the orders on that shipping page to the same shipping option. Again all you have to do is scroll up the page and you'll find a button that says \"make all same shipping\" simply click that button and the orders will automatically change to whatever shipping option you selected. I.E USPS FIRST CLASS, UPS GROUND, FEDEX etc. As long as that option is available for that order it will be selected, in the event that shipping option isn't available the extension will automatically default to the cheapest shipping option.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this extension as much as we enjoyed developing and creating it. Give it a try, we're eager to hear your feedback and ways on how we can improve."
