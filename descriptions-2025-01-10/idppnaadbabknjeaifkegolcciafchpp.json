Such resources can, in some cases, be exfiltrated by malicious sites making use of CPU-level information leaks on users' devices, such as the Spectre vulnerability.\n\nThe tool identifies resources which are exempt from default protections enabled in Google Chrome (Cross-Origin Read Blocking, SameSite cookies) and which can be embedded cross-site. The results are added to Chrome's DevTools \"Spectroscope\" panel and include security recommendations to help protect your resources from Spectre and other cross-site attacks.\n\nNote: This is a prototype extension which is meant to be used only as a convenience tool to help you protect your site; it is not an official Google product. Testing your site with Spectroscope is not a substitute for careful deployment of recommended web security features. See https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-post-spectre-webdev/ for a complete list of best practices.\n\nAuthors (alphabetically): Roberto Clapis, Santiago Diaz, Aleksandr Dobkin, David Dworken, Artur Janc, Aaron Shim, Lukas Weichselbaum"
