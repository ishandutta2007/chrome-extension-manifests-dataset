Whether you’re a power user or just someone who wants to keep things tidy, Flow streamlines your browsing experience. Here’s why you’ll love it:\n\nEffortless Tab Management\n• Create Sessions: Start fresh by initiating a new session. A dedicated Chrome window opens, marking the beginning of your focused browsing journey.\n• Automatic Saving: Flow takes care of your tabs in the background. Close a window without hesitation; your tabs are securely saved.\n• Resume Seamlessly: Reopen any session whenever you need to pick up where you left off.\n• Unsaved Windows: Add any open window to your sessions directly from the ‘Unsaved Windows’ section.\n\nBoost Your Workflow with Additional Features\n• Main Session: Designate a session as your ‘Main Session.’ When you launch Chrome, all other windows close, leaving only your essential workstream active.\n• Backups: Create local backups of your sessions. Flow auto-generates a backup before deleting any session, ensuring you never lose your work.\n• Dark Mode: Enjoy a sleek dark mode that’s easy on the eyes during late-night browsing.\n• Resizable Interface: Customize the extension’s size by simply dragging the bottom right corner to fit your screen and preferences.\n\nWhy Flow?\n\n• Simplicity: Flow keeps things straightforward.\n• Speed: It’s fast and reliable.\n• Organization: Say goodbye to tab overload.\n\nGive Flow a try and experience a clutter-free browsing environment. Your feedback is invaluable in making Flow even better!\n\n\nWhat's new?\n\n1.2.2\n• Add session freeze.\n• Code improvements.\n\n1.2.1\n• Organizing settings and added a few more settings in additional settings\n• Bug fixes\n\n1.2.0\n• Two new themes : deepBlue, magicalPurple\n• Performance improvements.\n• Fixed some bugs.\n\n1.1.0\n• Sessions can be opened in the current window. It can enabled in settings.\n• Project is open source now.
