Use our AI detector chrome extension to be able to see if a document was likely AI-generated or Human written. \n\nIf you need to prove that a Google document you created was written by you and not AI, then use our View Writing and Report feature that allows you to prove the authenticity of your writing by allowing anyone to…\n1️⃣ Watch a Character-by-Character Replay of the Writing Process\n👀 See how the document was written, character by character, offering full transparency.\n2️⃣ Report on Writing Sessions (Authors' Contributions)\n📈 Review session-by-session contributions to track changes and identify authors.\n3️⃣ AI Detection, Plagiarism, Readability, Grammar, and Spelling Scores\n🤖 📑 📖 Get comprehensive scores to ensure accuracy and originality.\n\nThis AI detector Chrome extension is specifically built to help ensure that any writer or student who is wrongly accused of using AI has the ability to defend themselves by providing helpful reports to prove that their content is Original.\n\nThis extension allows you to…\n\n👀 Watch a Writer Write: Replay the entire writing process.\n📈 Document Revision History: See session details, author contributions, and changes.\n👤 Author History & Contributions: Get transparent insights into writer activity.\n🤖 AI Detection Score: Identify AI-generated content.\n📑 Plagiarism Score: Check for originality against existing content.\n📖 Readability Score: Ensure your text is accessible to your audience \n📝 Grammar & Spelling Check: Identify and correct writing errors.\n🌐 Webpage Analysis: Works on any website, with extra features for Google Docs.\n📤 Download & Share Reports: Conveniently save and share insights.\n\n\nThe AI detector works on any website but the extension has the extra features exclusively for Google Documents. \n\nOriginality.ai has the most accurate ChatGPT AI Detector, but AI detection alone is not enough to achieve an enforceable level of understanding of a document's originality.\n\nThe Originality.ai Chrome Extension goes beyond just having the most accurate AI detection score but provides you with an Originality Report for Google Documents allowing you to...\n\n👀 Watch a Writer Write:\n\nUse the Originality.ai Chrome Extension to be able to \"watch a writer write\" the article. The Chrome extension can reverse engineer every edit that was made in the document to create a real-time or sped-up (up to 20x) display of the creation of the document. If a writer simply copies and pastes from ChatGPT then when you watch the writer write you will see a single block of text getting dropped into Google Docs.\n\n📈 Originality Report:\n\nGet a complete Originality Report including both the leading AI detection score along with the contributors to the document, the writing session history. This report, the AI score and the ability to watch the writer write creates the ability to prove the true Originality of a document.\n\n⭐️ How it Works:\n\nInstall the Chrome Extension\nIn a Google Doc generate an Originality Report to watch a writer write, see revision and edit history.\nTo use the AI, plagiarism or readability checker create an account at Originality.ai to get credits.\nOn any webpage simply highlight the text you want to know if it was AI-Generated, right click and scan with Originality.ai\n\n AI Trained to Detect Popular NLP Models:\nOriginality.ai’s own AI is trained to detect AI-generated content created by the popular NLP models used by all the popular AI writing tools.\n\nIt has trained and been shown to be accurate on the following NLP models.\n\nGPT-4o\nChatGPT\nClaude-3.5 Sonnet\nGemini Pro 1.5\nLlama 3\nAI Paraphrase or Humanizer\n\n🔴 Some Limitations\n\nThe ability to detect AI is not 100% accurate and so it can generate some false positives approximately 2% of the time. At 99% accurate on GPT-4o raw output it will not 100% of the time detect AI generated content. However, over a large enough sample the results can be relied upon. These limitations are where the Originality Report and ability to Watch a Writer Write a piece of content helps.\n\nSee Accuracy Study - https://originality.ai/ai-content-detection-accuracy/\n3rd Party Accuracy Studies - https://originality.ai/blog/ai-detection-studies-round-up\nTry our AI Detector - https://originality.ai/ai-checker\nTerms of Service – https://originality.ai/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy Policy – https://originality.ai/privacy-policy/"
