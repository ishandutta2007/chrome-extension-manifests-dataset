This happens right as the last turn begins to play out, before the animations have a chance to take place. Consequently, the results of a battle are often spoiled early - did I live the 50/50 damage roll? Did they dodge my Hydro Pump and get a Recover off? This extension restores the suspense of Pokemon Showdown battles by hiding the end-of-battle controls until the last turn finishes playing out.\n\nThe timer button is blacked out while a turn is in progress (since the timer stops at the end of a battle). However, you can hover over it anytime to see and use the timer."
