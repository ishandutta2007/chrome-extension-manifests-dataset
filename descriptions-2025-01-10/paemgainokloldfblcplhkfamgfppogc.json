Ken is my wonderful husband of 26 years. We have created this app to allow our customers to reach us easily and quickly and to notify you of product updates and promotions. \n\nAbout five years ago, we met this company, RELIV International. I was dealing with hormonal imbalance and migraine headaches. Ken is a diabetic and was struggling with managing his blood sugars. We both felt tired and irritable all day. We were not very fun to be around. In fact, our adult children seldom came to visit. \n\nWe started drinking these great nutritional shakes every day and in just a few months, began to notice results. Ken noticed he had more energy and was able to exercise more often and for longer periods of time. His blood sugar levels improved and his mood swings were gone. I also started to see results with increased stamina throughout the day and fewer migraine headaches. My brain fog lifted and hot flashes and night sweats reduced significantly. I felt a greater sense of well-being and happiness. I added the women's health product and a few months later, I had even better results. My hormones balanced out and I no longer had migraine headaches.\n\nToday, we are both in our mid-fifties and we feel better that we felt in our forties. We love to laugh together and we really enjoy each other's company. The best part is our kids love to come and hang out with us again. RELIV has truly changed our family dynamics for the better and Ken and I will always be grateful.\n\nBecause of our great results, Ken and I partnered with company and developed a home based business. We are having a blast helping people improve their health and also helping families improve their finances as they grow their business. It's really a blessing to be associated with RELIV International. Our future looks bright and we look forward to many more years of success."
