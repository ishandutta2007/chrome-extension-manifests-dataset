The user can also click on the artist and get to their Spotify page and explore more of their tracks. Clicking on the volume animation, the user will be redirected to the TANANANA radio page and listen to it. \n\nIt offers a streamlined flow for users who listen to online radio while doing other tasks on the browser and are curious what track is playing, without having to leave their current tab."
