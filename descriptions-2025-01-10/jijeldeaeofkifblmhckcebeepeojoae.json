The header text that is used to switch between \"Top Chat\" and unfiltered chat is reduced in size, as this is a setting that is barely touched, if at all. The Chat Input Box has reduced in size, and the user's name and Profile Picture are not shown above the Input Box. These changes reduce the sizes of the elements around the Chat Feed, and with some reduced padding the Chat Feed gets a bigger area, a bigger focus, and is easier to read. The Chat Frame is now also visibly attached to the Video Player, and rescales the Frame height bound to the height of the Video Player."
