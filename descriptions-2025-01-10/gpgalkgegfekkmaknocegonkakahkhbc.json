This extension makes legacy Shockwave content work effortlessly, requiring no extra setup. DirPlayer identifies and plays all Shockwave elements on a webpage, transforming your browser into a Shockwave emulator that works out of the box.\n\nDirPlayer is implemented in Rust and works across browsers via WebAssembly. Modern browser sandboxing and Rust’s memory safety ensures a secure experience, free from the vulnerabilities that once troubled the original Shockwave player.\n\nAs an open-source project supported by volunteers, DirPlayer is driven by a passion for preserving internet heritage. Our mission is to keep the vast array of websites and content accessible that would otherwise disappear without Shockwave support. Contributions of any type are welcome—whether you're developing code, testing old games, or providing feedback on your experience.\n\nDiscover more about DirPlayer, report issues, and join our community at https://github.com/igorlira/dirplayer-rs"
