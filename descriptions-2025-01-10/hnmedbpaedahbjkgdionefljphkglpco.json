Organization: It makes it much easier to sort and find specific images in your collections.\n2. Sharing: When you share these files, the recipients immediately understand what the image contains without having to open it.\n3. Inspiration: The AI-generated names can sometimes spark your creativity, giving you new perspectives on the images you've saved.\n\nOne of the best things about Candy is its user-friendly nature. The extension is designed to be intuitive and seamless, requiring minimal effort on your part to enjoy its benefits.\n\nRegarding privacy concerns, we want to assure our users that we take data protection very seriously.
