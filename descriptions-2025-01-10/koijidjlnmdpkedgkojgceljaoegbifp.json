In addition to default filters, the extension enables a user to fine-tune the browsing experience as per their individual requirements. The extension analyzes sentiment, categories and blacklisted topics to prevent the user from being overwhelmed with information that can possibly traumatize the user. The extension achieves this through simple keyword-based checks followed by detailed analysis. Even though it is mainly aimed at google search results it also checks websites for topics blacklisted by the user. The extension is in active development and its features are being continuously improved. \n\nTemporarily stop getting search results about information that may be sensitive to the user.  For example, one could add words such as “Stocks”, “News about Abuse”, “Murders / Deaths”, “Adult / Slang” etc.\n\nUses a basic but quick wordlist based sentiment analysis to flag badly worded or concerning results.\n\nCan add in words and tweak the sensitivity of filter based on issues.\n\nShows tags the search result is about on hover, and the source of the result so can be unhidden if the user wants to.\n\nNote: Search results are not analyzed on special pages such as that obtained when directly searching for pandemic related info and or other topics with misinformation surrounding them to prevent these from being blocked.\n\nAbusive language filtered with leet and profanity checks.\n\nOption between direct removal from google search if blacklisted keywords detected. \n\nBlacklist supports phrases as well\n\nRemote server for categorization and detailed analysis of flagged articles.\n\nCategorization based on 20 years Times of India headlines dataset\n\nOnload website blocking if blacklisted words detected on any non -google search based site.\n\nUpcoming Features :\n\nAdding a secondary check with context-aware sentiment analysis to reduce false positives without user intervention.\n\nChanging / Retraining the categorization ML model to a more accurate variant.\n\nStarter keywords to slide default levels for a casual user.\n\nTaking into account dislikes and image metadata for more features surrounding media.\n\nExtend native full-fledged support for social apps.\n\nInspiration : One of many news articles that highlights the growing issue. Further even in general issues and for those who suffer from PTSD.  \n\nThis extension is continuously being improved, we appreciate your valuable feedback and are open to any feature requests you may have.\n\n- An Initiative by RISHA Lab IIT Tirupati\nContact Email : ch@iittp.ac.in\nTechnical Issues: ch19b023@iittp.ac.in"
