You're not imagining it. Research shows that 8 out of 10 people primarily get their news through headlines, and publishers know exactly which emotional triggers get the most clicks. But at what cost to our society and mental well-being?\n\nWhy Neutrafy?\nWe're living in an era where our views and emotions are increasingly shaped by algorithms and carefully crafted headlines. It's getting harder to form our own genuine opinions when every headline is competing for our attention with emotionally charged language.\n\nNeutrafy helps you:\n- See news headlines in their purest form, stripped of unnecessary emotional triggers\n- Make your own decisions about what's important\n- Reduce the mental toll of consuming news\n- Break free from the cycle of outrage and division\n\nHow It Works\nJust one click. That's all it takes.\n\nWhen you're on CNBC's headlines page (support for more major publications coming soon), the extension icon turns red to indicate potential bias.\n\nClick it once, and watch as headlines transform into their neutral versions\n\nThe icon turns green to show you're viewing neutralized headlines.\n\nThe Science Behind It\nThis isn't just another extension - it's backed by research showing how different word choices in headlines, even when conveying the same information, can significantly impact mental health and societal divisions. We use Chrome's built-in AI to process headlines locally on your device, ensuring privacy and quick response times. \n\nWhy It Matters\nIn a world where extreme headlines drive engagement and ad revenue, we're losing our ability to think critically and form independent opinions. Neutrafy gives you back that power. It's not about censorship - it's about choice. See the news for what it is, not what emotions it's trying to trigger.\n\nLooking Ahead\nAs Chrome's AI capabilities grow, Neutrafy will only get better - faster processing, more languages, and even more accurate neutralization. We're just getting started.\n\nReady to take back control of your news experience? Give Neutrafy a try and see the difference for yourself"
