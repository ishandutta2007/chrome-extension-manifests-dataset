Having a solid strategy in place (like being able to track all the bids placed by each bidder) is the first step in winning more auctions.  Winning more auctions while using less bids is effectively like having...you guessed it, free bids on DealDash!\n\nThis software always has been and always will be completely free.  Once installed just navigate to any auction and the software will keep a \"running tab\" on the total bids placed by each bidder on the auction.  It can't do so while you're away from an auction, so if you're highly interested in one particular DealDash auction (or even a couple of them) just be sure to keep each auction open within your browser.  Then right in your browser you'll see the total bids placed by each bidder right next to their name in the dealdash auction bid timeline.\n\nJust install this free software and go ahead and open up any auction to see what it can do to help you getting the next best thing to getting free bids on DealDash."
