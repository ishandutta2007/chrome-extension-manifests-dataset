We hope you like it!\n\nClicking on the Addon button will display a summary of your ySense account. This includes the number of Surveys available to you. It also gives you a quick overview of your account status, including your balance and past and current earnings, plus one-click access to most pages of the ySense site.\n\nThe information displayed on the ySense Addon is updated every 5 minutes so don't be surprised if something does not match your current account information. \n\nThe Addon has a series of options that can quickly be accessed by clicking on the Options button. These options give you a lot of flexibility on what you would like to be notified about, be it simply by showing a number on the ySense Addon button, by popup notifications that appear on the taskbar or by the sound alerts.\n\nEverything that you see on the Addon is pretty much self-explanatory, in case of doubt just move your mouse over the respective area and a tooltip will appear explaining what you are seeing.\n\nIf you have any issues, questions or suggestions please feel free to contact us."
