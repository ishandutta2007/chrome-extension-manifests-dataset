Users also get direct analysis on how partisan their reading patterns are in a dashboard on their new tab page that tracks their political browsing history. Our dashboard gives users a list of recommended articles that can order to balance out the perspectives and biases in your reading history. Finally, underneath articles on your Facebook, Twitter and Google news feed, we suggest relevant articles that would broaden your perspective. We also warn you with a notification if you share an article on Facebook you have not read, or read an extensive amount of news that is consistently biased on one side of a topic.\n\nPrivacy Disclosure:\nThe Open Mind extension relies on tracking user browsing activity to provide insights to the user. The Open Mind extension is able to analyse the bias in your news and provide recommendations by sending the urls of webpages you browse to our server at https://api.whimmly.com, over encrypted HTTPS. Our server analyzes the articles and sends the results back to your browser. You can read our privacy policy here: https://openmind.press/privacy-policy"
