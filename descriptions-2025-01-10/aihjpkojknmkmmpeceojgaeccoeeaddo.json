To earn money you have to breed and sell fish - there is 28 different species with different characteristics, some of the fishes are very rare.\n\nWith more money you can buy bigger and prettier fishes, more impressive aquarium decorations and better lighting. But the most expensive animal you can buy is not a fish - it's a dolphin!"
