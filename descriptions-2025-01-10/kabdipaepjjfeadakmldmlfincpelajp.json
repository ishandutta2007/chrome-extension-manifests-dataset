As seen in Auth0 hackathon - https://devpost.com/software/autocorrect-remover\n\nWith many students learning online now, even English class, this is not great for learning, people don't learn what words they are misspelling. Google docs auto-corrects or shows the word without letting you think about it and re type itâ€¦ and other systems doing the same, auto correcting or trying to say what you should type even!\n\nThis project aims to make online documents more like natural paper writing, encouraging students to guess the correct word themselves rather than seeing the corrected word when they click it.\n\nThis addon currently ONLY works on Google docs, in the future we hope this will have more features, work better and work with more online systems like Microsoft Word Online.\n\nIf you are a developer please consider contributing to this project for Hacktoberfest! https://github.com/programmin1/Autocorrect-remover"
