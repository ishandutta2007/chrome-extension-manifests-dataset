If you are tired of Chrome hijacking your muscle memory on ^W, this extension is for you! It provides two commands, one which does nothing, and one which closes the current tab. If you map the former to Ctrl-W, and the latter to Alt-W, you will never again mistakenly close a tab!\n\nA future version may include the expected Ctrl-W functionality, but don't hold your breath."
