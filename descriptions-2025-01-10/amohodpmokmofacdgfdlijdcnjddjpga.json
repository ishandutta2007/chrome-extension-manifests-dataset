Is your following directory filled with people playing a game you don't want to watch?  Do you want to narrow your following page to only show a particular game?  Following Filters for Twitch lets you do that and more.\n\nThis extension injects a UI element into https://www.twitch.tv/directory/following/live\n\nThis UI element allows us to filter our followed channels in two ways:\n - Show channels playing only selected games\n - Hide channels playing selected games\n\nUse the checkmark or hit enter in the text area to apply a filter, and use the trashcan to clear your filters.\n\nNote that this extension automatically redirects the \"Overview\" section of the following page (https://www.twitch.tv/directory/following) to the \"Live\" section (https://www.twitch.tv/directory/following/live).\n\nNOTE: I developed this extension alone and am confident bugs still exist.  If you find any please \nraise an issue on the github repository for this project: https://github.com/adamburich/Twitch-Following-Filters/\n\n- Thanks :D"
