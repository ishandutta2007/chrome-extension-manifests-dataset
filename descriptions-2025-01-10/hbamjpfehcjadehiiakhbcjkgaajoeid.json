Or are you looking for better ways to stay organized and manage your time? \n\nThe SAS Schoology Sidekick is designed to help students at Singapore American School using Schoology efficiently manage their tasks, assignments and assessments on the platform. Items posted by teachers on the platform are uploaded in to the extension (via Schoology's calendar feature with the refresh icon on the extension), which acts as a to-do list where students can edit tasks, add their own, and mark them as completed."
