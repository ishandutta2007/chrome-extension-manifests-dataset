It allows you to consult all the relevant SEO information of a page in a single click. The best companion for professional SEO consultants.\n\nPerseo allows you to consult the most important SEO information of the page you visit and identify any existing problems or anomalies super-fast. This way you can spend more time on strategy and less time gathering information to diagnose problems.\n\nThe Chrome extension Perseo has been created with the aim of being an essential tool, incorporating all the features that an SEO may need to audit a website in the first instance and saving time in that task. To do this, nothing better than to be inspired by the best. Therefore, we have taken the most useful features from the most prominent extensions in the industry to create the ultimate SEO extension.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSEO: Displays all SEO-relevant on-page elements. In one click you will have all the information you need at a glance.\nNetwork: Allows you to view the details and HTTP headers of all requests to reach the current page.\nHeadings: Lists all H1-H6 headings included on the page in a hierarchical and attractive format.\nSchema: Displays the structured data included in the page in a user-friendly format. You will no longer have to navigate through the source code to detect what types it contains.\nAssets: Presents the links, images, scripts and stylesheets of the page in an easy to consult way.\nDocs: Provides multiple links to official documentation categorized by area of interest to facilitate the consultation of recurring topics.\n\nSupported on-page SEO elements:\n\nURL\nFavicon\nStatus code\nCanonical link tag\nCanonical HTTP header\nRobots meta tag\nX-Robots-Tag HTTP header\nRefresh meta tag\nTitle\nH1 heading\nDescription meta tag\nKeywords meta tag\nAuthor meta tag\nStructured data summary\nLanguage attribute\nCharset meta tag\nVary HTTP header\nContent-Encoding HTTP header\nrel=\"alternate\" link tag\nViewport meta tag\nManifest link tag\nAMP attribute\nrel=\"amphtml\" link tag\nHreflang link tag\nrel=\"prev/next\" link tag\nResource hint link tag\nResource hint HTTP header\nLink tag\nrobots.txt\nSitemaps\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.5.1:\n- (improved) Until now, when opening the popup, if the page failed to load (it did not even return a status code), the message \"loading, or no data available for this page, try reload the tab\" was displayed. Now, when this situation occurs, a message \"error page, no data available for this page\" is displayed to differentiate both cases.\n- (fixed) The copy headings option in the Headings tab did not generate the text string properly when there was an empty heading (i.e.: <h3></h3>) on the page.\n- (fixed) Fixed bug that caused, in some cases, a page canonicalized to another page using a canonical tag with a URL without a domain to be mistakenly identified as INDEXABLE when it should be classified as CANONICALISED.\n- (fixed) Fixed bug in Schema tab where tags with an itemscope attribute without itemtype attribute were shown in the structured data list as \"null\". Now they are displayed with a more descriptive message: \"(No itemtype)\"."
