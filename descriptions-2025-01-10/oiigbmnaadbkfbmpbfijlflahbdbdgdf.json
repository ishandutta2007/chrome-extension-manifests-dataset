These translations are not perfect or complete, so I welcome anyone to help translate. Currently supported: English and Japanese.\n--- Note: in v1.0.8.4 I've reverted back to support for English and Japanese.\n- Updated the panel to better adjust to translations that have long phrases (e.g. changed \"Rating\" button to a star icon with a description on hover)\n- Added ability on the Options page to quickly move whitelist/blacklist entries to the other list (e.g. move a whitelist entry to the blacklist)\n- Enhance \"Prevent Clipboard Interference\" feature to protect against execCommand('copy') and execCommand ('cut') calls\n- Fix issue where some elements were not being listed under \"Blocked Items\"\n- Updated unwanted content providers list\n\nv1.0.8.0 - Thursday, June 30, 2016\n- Revamped the design of the Update page and the Options page: wider layout, larger/more readable words, and intuitive buttons. On the new Options page you are able to toggle between Grouped and List views by clicking on the button in the top-right corner.\n- Fingerprinting Protection section contains the following options (all disabled by default, one or two have been added since v1.0.7.15):\n--- Canvas Fingerprint Protection - protect against fingerprinting attempts through <canvas> elements, with the following options:\n------ Disabled\n------ Blank Readout (serve an empty canvas with the original dimensions)\n------ Random Readout (serve an empty canvas with random dimensions)\n------ Completely Block Readout (refuse to serve any data)\n--- Block Audio Fingerprinting - prevent fingerprinting via the AudioContext API\n--- Block WebGL Fingerprinting - prevent fingerprinting via the WebGL API\n--- Block Battery Fingerprinting - prevent fingerprinting via the Battery API\n--- Block Device Enumeration - prevent having hardware devices detected via the WebRTC API\n--- Block Gamepad Enumeration - prevent having hardware devices detected via the Gamepad API\n--- Block Canvas Font Access - prevent system fonts from being enumerated through <canvas> elements\n--- Block Client Rectangles Fingerprinting - prevent fingerprinting through calculating element client rectangles)\n--- Reduce Keyboard Fingerprinting (for advanced users) - make keypress timings more random to increase anonymity (note: adds a random delay between keypresses))\n--- I recommend enabling all of the above options (except the last two) for increased privacy, and based on your needs disable the options that interfere with your usage.\n- Added Remove Google Analytics (UTM) Tracking option (under Privacy Settings) - remove Google Analytics (UTM) tracking tokens before they're actually passed to the server (disabled by default)\n- Added Remove Possible Hash Tracking option (under Privacy Settings) - remove possible tracking tokens passed using hash, where there is an attribute and value (e.g. #xtor=RSS-1) (disabled by default)\n- Added Spoof Timezone option (under Privacy Settings) - spoof or randomize your timezone; useful if you use VPN (disabled by default)\n- Added Prevent Clipboard Interference option (under Behavior Settings) - prevent pages from interfering with clipboard actions (disabled by default)\n- Added option to apply user-agent spoofing on whitelisted domains as well (default behaviour is to disable spoofing on whitelisted domains to avoid issues, but enabling this option will spoof the user-agent regardless)\n- Added Save as Text File functionality to the Export Settings portion in the Options page\n- Fix Panel expand issue for Mac OS X users\n- Updated unwanted content providers list\n- I now have a Bitcoin address due to inquiries from people wary of PayPal but wanted to still donate! 39VJ5L9Yd6WocG6r88uE7ZZnM5J2M5bW92 (also found at the top of the Update and Options pages)\n\n===============================\nPast Releases:\n\nSee complete changelog here: https://www.andryou.com/scriptsafe/changelog/\n\n=====================\n\nBug reports/downloads/support: https://github.com/andryou/scriptsafe\n\nAn extension that gives users control of the web and more secure browsing while emphasizing simplicity and intuitiveness:\n\n-whitelisting/blacklisting functionality and granular control\n-protection against fingerprinting (e.g. canvas)\n-protect against WebRTC leaks\n-automatic auto-syncing of settings AND whitelist/blacklists across your devices (via Google Sync)\n-actually speeds up browsing because it blocks a lot of unwanted content from being downloaded\n-remove <SCRIPT>, <OBJECT>, <EMBED>, <IFRAME>, <FRAME>, <APPLET>, <AUDIO>, <VIDEO>, <NOSCRIPT>, and <IMG> elements, as well as webbugs\n-block unwanted content (MVPS HOSTS, hpHOSTS (ad / tracking servers only), Peter Lowe's HOSTS Project, MalwareDomainList.com, and DNS-BH – Malware Domain Blocklist are integrated!)\n-block click-through referrer data\n-spoof referrer/user-agent/timezone data\n-block unwanted cookies\n-\"intuitive\" icon that changes based on whether or not a page is whitelisted/blacklisted/bypassed\n-shows number of blocked/removed items in toolbar\n-shows blocked/allowed items in tab details popup (along with item type)\n-bulk import domains into whitelist and blacklist\n-option to temporarily allow a page/temporarily allow all blocked items\n-choose the default mode (Block All or Allow All)\n-option to preserve same-domain elements\n-option to disable automatic refresh of pages after whitelisting/blacklisting/temp. bypassing a page\n-support for IPv6 addresses\n\nIf you like this extension, please support me by going to the Options page and clicking on the heart!\n\nEnjoy :) If you are bilingual/multilingual (english + other language), and are interested in helping translate ScriptSafe, contact me: andryou@gmail.com\n\n-Andrew Y.
