As rain triggers a catastrophic glitch event, watch familiar characters evolve into corrupted computer versions of themselves, creating an eerily beautiful musical experience. This modification features unique character redesigns, glitch-based sound effects, and a compelling narrative about Mr. Fun Computer's search for his digital family. Perfect for fans of the original Incredibox who want to explore a darker, more experimental version of the beloved music creation game."
