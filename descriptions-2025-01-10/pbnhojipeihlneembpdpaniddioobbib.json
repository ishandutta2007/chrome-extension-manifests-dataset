The background blocker tells the content blocker to remove the script from the webpage. This blocks sites self-hosted miners and proxy-miners.\n\nv1.0.2: Added Settings page to allow users to add white-listed URL patterns.. For example:  (.*?)google(.*?) would allow all urls that contain \"google\" to not be scanned. These rules use \"regex\"/\"regular expression\" patterns. Also added new patterns to block Base64 encoded Javascript miners which was a workaround to this plugin. Now this blocks everything again =]\n\nv1.0.3: Fixed bug in Firefox and Chrome which causes webRequest.onBeforeRequest to NOT cancel the download of bad files. To fix it, I made scanning synchronous instead of asynchronous (a bit slower, but not noticeable). Fixes issue: https://github.com/Brandon-T/Coin-Blocker/issues/1\n\nv1.0.4: Fixed bug in the code which caused some white-listed sites to be scanned and blocked still. Added debugging code to print to the developer's console exactly what was blocked and what was allowed."
