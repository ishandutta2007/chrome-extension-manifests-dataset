Absolutely no data collection.\n✅ No ads, No in-app purchases.100% free, 100% fun.\n\nBackground: A while back there was a website by Tom Scott that would get the weather in an area and compare it to a Star Wars planet. This website has unfortunately  stopped working due to reasons listed here. This extension revives and expands on this idea, there are now 10 planets, and each one has 2 images for day and night. This also uses more data about the climate like humidity, wind speeds and elevation."
