Simply change the range on the slider and watch as comments you don't want to see disappear!\n\nTired of seeing only the comments from the fastest redditors at the top? Simply slide up and see only fresh comments. Want to see what people were saying about the half time show on a sports match? Now you can!\n\nNOTE: Rewind Reddit is not associated with reddit, does NOT ask for your reddit login information and you do NOT need to be logged in to reddit.com for this extension to work. Rewind Reddit works independently of reddit. Rewind Reddit is spyware/adware free and will not harm your computer/browser in any way. Rewind Reddit does not track, store or sell any personal information.\n\nIf you discover a problem with Rewind Reddit, let us know right away and we will fix the issue ASAP!"
