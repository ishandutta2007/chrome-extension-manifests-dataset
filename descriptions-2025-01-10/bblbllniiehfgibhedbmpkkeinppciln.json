Clicking the button increases the speed by 0.5x, with a max of 3x. Right clicking the button decreases the speed by 0.5x. \n\nThe speed is retained between videos, and sessions, in chrome storage.\n\nI mainly made this extension for myself, and I didn't need anything fancy. Report any bugs to the GitHub.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv1.1.0 — Added a \"next video\" button. The button will always appear even if there is no next video. The functionality should never break, however, as it simply seeks to the end of the video and plays. This allows VRV to handle the \"end of video\" as per normal.\n\nv1.1.1 — Made the speed on the icon more readable.\n\nv1.1.2 — Fixed the \"next video\" button not always working. (Isn't that ironic, in the intial version I said it would never break! TBH, no idea why it did break. I'm going to blame VRV for being bad.)"
