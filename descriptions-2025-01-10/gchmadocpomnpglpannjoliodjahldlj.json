It automatically fetches the corresponding codes from your security card, saving you from having to find your card and extract the codes yourself.\n\nThe entire process is run locally, meaning that the neural network is embedded into the extension itself and not hosted on a server somewhere else. The card details will be saved in the chrome local storage and can't be accessed by anyone else.\n\nIt works on all urls that are on the interactivebrokers.com host. If you are viewing a url from another host the extension will become inactive. \n\nUsage:\n1) Click on the \"Card\" button on the extension to fill out your card details (the next update will include a feature that automatically fills out the details from photos of your card)\n\n2) Login to either web trader or account management at Interactive Brokers\n\n3) When the index number image appears, click \"Run\" on the extension. The digits and codes will then appear on the pop-up of the extension\n\n\nFull code: https://github.com/ivan-chan123/easy-login-for-interactive-brokers"
