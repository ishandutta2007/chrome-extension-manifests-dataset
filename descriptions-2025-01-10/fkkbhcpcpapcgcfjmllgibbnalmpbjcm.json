Repeat for all criterias you want to find albums for. Click the x to the right of the added search criteria to remove it.\n\nWhen you find an interesting album, click on it to jump to its page.\n\nNote that search criterias that have not been cached previously might take a while for the server to cache up.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n- It isn't possible to get all albums from Bandcamp so some albums might be missing.\n\nWEBPAGE\nAlso available as a webpage at www.campexplorer.io\n\nSOURCE\nCode is available at https://github.com/SvDvorak/CampExplorer\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n2.0.0\n- Improved number of results returned by up to 10x\n- Instantaneous results for previously searched tags\n- Changed app logo\n- Changed name from Bandcamp Tag Search to Camp Explorer\n- Added logo and title in popup\n- Added release notes in app\n- Added app review question\n\n1.0.4\n- Minor fix in preparation for larger update\n\n1.0.3\n- Fixed rare error when having multiple tags\n\n1.0.2\n- Changed Bandcamp throttling message.\n\n1.0.1\n- Fixed app not handling 503 (Service unavailable) errors which occurs when searching Bandcamp too often. App now retries multiple times with a longer timeout for each try. A graphical icon next to the search spinner indicates when this is happening.\n\n1.0.0\n- Initial release"
