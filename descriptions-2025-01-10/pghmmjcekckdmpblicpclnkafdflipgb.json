These features significantly enhance the user experience by streamlining communication, saving time, and ensuring that messages are both professional and contextually appropriate.\n\nHereâ€™s a brief overview of the main features of the LinkedIn AI Chatbot extension:\n\n1. Voice-to-Text Feature: Simplifies communication by allowing users to speak their messages, which are transcribed accurately and inserted directly into the LinkedIn message textbox. Ideal for busy professionals or those on the go, it ensures hands-free messaging and efficiency.\n\n2. AI-Powered Message Drafting: The AI chatbot helps draft professional messages tailored to different contexts, whether for networking, job applications, or business communication. It provides structured, polished messages that save users time while ensuring professionalism.\n\n3. Instant Message Insertion: The extension automatically inserts the generated or transcribed message into the LinkedIn textbox, reducing the need for copy-pasting and enhancing workflow efficiency.\n\n4. Chat History with Session Storage: Keeps track of AI-generated messages within a session, allowing users to revisit and refine their drafts easily. The chat history remains accessible as long as the browsing session is active."
