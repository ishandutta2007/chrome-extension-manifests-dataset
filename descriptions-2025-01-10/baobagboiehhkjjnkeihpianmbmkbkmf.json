With UiPath Robot Runner, you can easily connect to UiPath robots, customize configurations, and store settings for future runs.\n\nOnce configured, UiPath Robot Runner saves your setup—including Endpoint, Process Name, and API parameters—as well as the last argument’s name and value, locally. This eliminates the need to re-enter details each time, ensuring that each run uses the latest configuration and providing a seamless experience for repeat tasks and custom automations.\n\nKey Features:\n\nConnect and run UiPath robots from your browser.\n\nSave configuration details (e.g., Endpoint, Process Name, and API parameters) for future runs.\n\nConfigure and save arguments locally (name and value) for efficient, repeatable automation workflows.\n\nBenefits:\n\nSave time by running robots with pre-saved configurations and arguments.\n\nStreamline automations without re-entering details each time."
