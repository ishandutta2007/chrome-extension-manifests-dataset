To refine the scope of these reports, users define data selection criteria, which act as filters to extract specific subsets of records. However, adding these criteria manually requires navigating to the \"List of Values\" tab, clicking the \"Add\" button, and inputting each value individuallyâ€”a repetitive and time-intensive process, particularly when dealing with extensive lists.\n\nThe Data Selection Import Tool simplifies this workflow. By allowing users to paste an entire list of values into a text box and submit them in a single action, the extension automates the entire sequence: it clicks the \"Add\" button, enters each value into the field, and confirms the addition for every line in the list. This efficient automation saves users considerable time and effort, boosting productivity and ensuring a smoother, more streamlined reporting experience."
