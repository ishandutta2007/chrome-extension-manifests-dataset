There may be times when you want to alter layouts or add additional capabilities to somebody else's site. With Monkey-Wrench, you can do all that.\n\nMonkey-Wrench allows you to add external JavaScript libraries and CSS files as well, so you can use CDNs and other hosted sources for your JS and CSS. Additionally, you can write your own JavaScript and CSS too. Specify which site (URL, regular expressions supported) you want this utility to run on, and bamm! You're done! You can have Monkey Wrench to run your code automatically or make it run on the click of the button.\n\nLet us know how you liked the extension. We intend to build a community of scripts and host them soon. If you would like to share your scripts, send us an email at mayurck291@gmail.com for now. If you would like to contribute, don't hesitate. We hope you love Monkey-Wrench.\n\nDevelopers: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Gulagulaananda\nhttps://twitter.com/mayurck291\nhttps://twitter.com/parinck"
