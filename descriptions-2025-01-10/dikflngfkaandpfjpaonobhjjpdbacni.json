Check out:\nhttp://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Giant_Floating_Baby_Head\n\nWant an image other than the Baby Head? Select your own image on the options page. It could be Worf, a Creeper, Donald Trump, etc. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe Giant Floating Baby Head appears at random (every 10-40 minutes after opening a new tab), or according to the settings set on the options page (open Manage Extensions, click on the 'Details' button for the extension, and select 'Extension options').\nYou can also trigger the appearance manually by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F (configurable) on almost any webpage! (Chrome restricts it from running on certain pages.)\n\nUpdates:\n0.7 - Supports multiple user-defined image URLs\n0.10 - Configurable keyboard shortcut\n0.12 - Configure which websites the GFBH should not appear on\n0.14 - Configure duration\n\nMake sure to check out the options page. More settings and options coming soon!\nPlease rate and comment! Let me know what options/improvements you'd like to see and let me know if you encounter any bugs.\n\nPermissions:\n\"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" - GFBH doesn't read any data from the sites you visit.  This permission just allows GFBH to display on any website.\n\nNote: This extension is not endorsed by or affiliated with \"Phineas and Ferb\" or \"Disney Channel\"."
