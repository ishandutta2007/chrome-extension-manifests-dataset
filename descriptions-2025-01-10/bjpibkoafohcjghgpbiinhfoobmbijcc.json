Seamlessly add GIFs and meme images to your pull request comments and descriptions by just typing a keyword.  For example, type \"/shipit\" and a gif of a big ship is inserted, or \"/goodjob\" to let the developer know how awesome she is!\n\nGitmeme integrates with Giphy to find you fun memes, and also builds a community of popular images.  It remembers your favorite images, and you can add new images to really express yourself.  It also remembers images made by others in your company or open source community, so you are suggested images from those around you, allowing for fun in-jokes on your team."
