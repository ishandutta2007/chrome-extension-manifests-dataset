The blind can not solve the image captchas in the login and registration of sites and some online payment gateways (in some countries) that do not have the ability to play audio, and this has caused problems for the blind on these pages. The Padcha extension only solves image captchas and other types of captchas are not supported. In order to prevent any misuse of this tool, validation and tracking mechanisms have been considered."
