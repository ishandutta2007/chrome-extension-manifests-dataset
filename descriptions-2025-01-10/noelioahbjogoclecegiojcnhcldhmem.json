This helps you identify potentially fake reviews and choose trusted sources more effectively.\n\nWhy Install RatingVerifier?\nIdentify Fake Reviews: The extension marks ratings on Google search results, making it easier to spot potentially manipulated reviews.\nChoose Trusted Sources: By highlighting ratings, you can quickly identify and choose sources you trust.\nEnhanced Browsing Experience: Avoid wasting time on unreliable websites and focus on credible information.\n\nHow It Works\nGoogle uses the JSON-LD schema to structure data on web pages. One of the common schemas used is the AggregateRating schema, which allows websites to display star ratings directly in search results. This schema includes information like the average rating, the number of reviews, and the best and worst ratings.\n\nExample of JSON-LD AggregateRating Schema:\n{\n  \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"Product\",\n  \"name\": \"Example Product\",\n  \"aggregateRating\": {\n    \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n    \"ratingValue\": \"4.5\",\n    \"reviewCount\": \"24\"\n  }\n}\n\nPotential for Manipulation\nWhile the AggregateRating schema is a powerful tool for displaying ratings, it can be manipulated by website owners. Unless Google has a reason to suspect a website, it might display the rating provided by the site origin. This means that some ratings might not be entirely trustworthy.\n\nReference\nFor more information on how Google handles ratings and reviews, you can refer to discussions on Google's Webmaster Central Help Forum: https://support.google.com/webmasters/thread/214882364/how-does-google-validate-ratingcount-in-aggregate-review-schema?hl=en\n\nBy installing RatingVerifier, you can take control of your browsing experience, avoid potentially fake reviews, and make more informed decisions based on trusted sources."
