This is a really useful tool if you are a musician and want to play along songs you found on your favorite music/video streaming service.\n\nWith keyboard shortcuts, it is easy to mark in and out audio. Two markers (A and B) can be placed at current playhead position when you need. You can also change the playback speed down to 0.2x and up to 5x. This is not available for example on YouTube.\n\nAlso it is generally not possible to download music from streaming sevices directly to your computer but with the help of web players of these services, it is possible to do music training using the browser.\n\nCurrently supported pages;\n\nyoutube.com\n\nmusi.sh (Apple Music)\n\nvimeo.com\n\ntidal.com\n\nThese services will be covered later on upon request;\n\nopen.spotify.com\n\nsoundcloud.com\n\nContact me at alinacierdem.com for requests and bug reports.\n\nIcons made by Pixel perfect (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/pixel-perfect)\nCreative Commons BY 3.0"
