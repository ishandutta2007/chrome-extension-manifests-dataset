It contains smart functions to filter boards and to create JQL queries from them. Reports exists to analyze flow and make forecasts as well as visualizations of plans.\n\nData Privacy Clarifications\nScope360° is a Chrome Extension that reads data through Jira Rest API’s. All data used from the issues in Jira is metadata and title and they are not stored locally on the client, not on any server and is not sent anywhere over the network.\n\nTo manage how Scope360° should interpret the data in Jira, a configuration is stored on a server controlled by us. The configuration is accessed by the Scope360° application and a hashed url and a hashed user email is used to get the right configuration.\n\nScope360° uses Google Analytics to understand how Scope360° is used. \nLogin credentials are stored encrypted in local storage if provided in Scope360°."
