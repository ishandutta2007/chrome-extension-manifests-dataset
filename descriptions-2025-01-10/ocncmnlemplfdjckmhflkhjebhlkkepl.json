The contents of these messages are not shared with RTrack, except in a minhash-ed form, which is a type of hashing algorithm and is not readable as text. The ID of the message, your user ID, and the user ID of the person who sent the message are also shared with RTrack to allow tracking of prolific spamming accounts, and to give an idea of the number of users being targeted."
