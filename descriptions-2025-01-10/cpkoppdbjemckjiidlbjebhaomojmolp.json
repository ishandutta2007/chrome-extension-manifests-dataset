You see a really interesting/useful tweet, and want to get back to it in the future. You like it, hoping that you remember to scroll through your likes at some future point to re-find it amidst the sea of memes you've also been liking. But you never remember, and the tweet is lost to your memory.\n\nTabtweet was created to help you bank tweets for later, and remember them through spaced repetition. See one every time you open a new tab!\n\nCreated by: https://www.twitter.com/userlastname\n\nReach out if you have any questions, or find a bug!"
