Your browsing then becomes fully anonymous: the sites you visit will not see your actual IP address and you will appear to be accessing the internet from a new location.\n\nIf your connection is censored and you cannot open certain sites, a web proxy will bypass the block and restore unrestricted access to your connection. Some content on popular video sites may not be available to watch in your country. \n\nWith a web proxy you can reroute your internet connection to a place in the world where the content is available.\n\nRemember to adjust options for optimal performance."
