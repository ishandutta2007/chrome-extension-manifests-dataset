It is designed to provide alerts when earthquakes of a certain magnitude, which the user can adjust, are reported by the USGS. Additionally, it notifies users of any changes in the status of the reported data (e.g., â€˜reviewedâ€™, â€˜automaticâ€™, etc.) and any variations in magnitude, and allows users to set a time range for tracking changes. The goal of this program is to make it easier for users to recognize significant earthquakes using audiovisual alerts.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nStatus [reviewed, automatic, undefined, deleted] are shown on the USGS page('earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/')  with colors, when the magnitude is greater than given value.\nreviewed = red: (Meaning that USGS expert has reviewed)\nautomatic = green: (USGS expert has not yet reviewed)\nundefined = yellow: (? For exception) \ndeleted = none: (Since it is not shown...)\n\nOther helpful info(API AND TERMS ) could be found on USGS documentation sites below:\nAPI: (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) \nTERMS: (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/index.php)\n\nWhen this extension is running; \"Only List Earthquakes  Shown on Map\" option is being hidden to avoid misleading such as mismatching between (USGS web) and (popup alert includes TTS).\n\nThis extension will be restarted in every 1Hour - 1Week depends on the option you would give. It takes a huge amount of RAM compare to other similar extensions I have made such as monitoring CWA_EQ(Taiwan Earthquake) and JMA_EQ(Japan Earthquake) which are NOT listed on Chrome Web Store. (I have NO idea).....ðŸ«¤ðŸ˜• However, in each restart, program would run without any problem (I hope so). <= This is OPENSOURCE...
