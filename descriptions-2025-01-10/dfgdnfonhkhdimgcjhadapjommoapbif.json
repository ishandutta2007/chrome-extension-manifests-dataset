The User submits anonymous reports that are gathered in real time and reported instantly.\n \n### The Virtual Incident Reporting Operation allows the User to quickly report:\n \n✓ Where the online abuse took place\n✓ What was said to the User (eg., racist comment, attack on personal appearance, etc.)\n✓ What was the nature of the abuse (eg., verbal threat, urge self-harm, etc.)\n✓ How did it make the User feel (eg., angry, hurt/sad, targeted, etc.)\n✓ What action did the User take (if any) (eg., blocked harasser, reported to platform, etc.)\n✓ What was the impact of the abuse (eg., couldn’t sleep, worried about my safety, etc.)\n \n### User reports enable collective action designed to hold the social media companies accountable for allowing online harassment, hate and abuse to continue and grow unchecked.\n \n### Real time reporting statistics are reported on the app and available to the User at the completion of each report submitted.\n \nVIRO is a project of Informed Opinions, a registered charity in Canada. Detailed statistics from VIRO can be found at informedopinions.org/onlineabuse"
