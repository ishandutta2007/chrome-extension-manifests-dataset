This means you need to open a browser tab, go to Unblock-Us and click the link to re-associate your new IP address with your account.\n\nThis extension re-associates your IP automatically with Unblock-Us every 5 minutes (as long as you have a running Chrome browser window with the extension installed).\n\nFor me this works fine because I have a 24/7 always-on HTPC with Chrome always open :-)\n\nNote that if you are signed in to Chrome, and your extensions are synched, and you open a Chrome window from work or some other network, there could be a conflict in IP assignments. If this is an issue, you may consider creating a second Chrome profile on your always-on device, and install the extension only in that (non-synched) profile.\n\n*** DISCLAIMER ***\nThis extension is provided as-is, and has no official association with Unblock-Us service provider. Use at own risk, etc, etc."
