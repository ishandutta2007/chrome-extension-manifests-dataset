Of course, you want the best price.\n\nIf you are a frequent Amazon user living in Europe, chances are, you have already known the fact that among the European countries, they have not only 1, but many different stores. At the time of Dec 2020, there are Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Netherland, United Kingdom, and Sweden (newly launched on Oct28, 2020)\n\nAnd the number probably will still increase.\n\nIf you are a frequent user living in Europe, chances are, you have also already figured out that most of the items are sold in all the markets above; they can be shipped within EU; but the prices differ, sometimes greatly.\n\nSo let me describe normally as a non-millionaire what you would do:\n\n1. Open amazon.de (maybe uk, es, fr, it, se, nl, be; depending on where you live)\n2. Search the product you want\n3. Copy the name of the product\n4. Open 7 other new tabs, for other markets\n5. Paste the name you copied in step 3, to the 7 tabs you just opened and click search\n6. Switching back and forth between all the tabs for the lowest price\n\nYou probably see where I'm going with this, and yes, you are right: it is annoying to do the same thing 8 times every time you want to search something, which probably you won't even buy in the end, and even if you do, it may be something only cost something ninety-nine so the effort really isn't worth it.\n\nWell, now you are saved. Install this plugin, just a single click, and you get the best price. No fuss, no muss.\n\nKnown Issue:\n\nFor CD/books/DVD categories, some products have multiple format, like a movie can have multiple formats like DVD, blue-ray, etc; for some products can't parse price correctly."
