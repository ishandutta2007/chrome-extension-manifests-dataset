Ever wondered what the Googlebot get‚Äôs to see online that you do not? Install 1000 Bots to find out and surf the Internet as Googlebot ‚Äì the most influential Internet\nuser of all.\n\n1000 Bots is a simple web extension which changes your browser‚Äôs user agent to that of the Googlebot. Googlebot is a web crawler which surfs the web extensively to build a searchable index for the Google search engine (making it one of the most influential Internet users. Only what it sees is indexed and can be found by other users later). By changing your settings to match those of Googlebot, you become one of thousands of Google web crawlers browsing the web to index its contents.\n\nSurfing the web as Googlebot gives you access to what is referred to as the grey web, a layer of content only visible to bots. In some cases it might give you access to websites and archives that are usually hidden behind a paywall. Because while the website owner will serve the normal user a login page, they will give web crawlers access to their full archive in order for it to be represented in Google‚Äôs search results.\n\nStep 1:\nüíª Install the web extension\n\nStep 2:\nüì° To start surfing as Googlebot, clicking on the icon in the browser toolbar\n\nStep 3: \nüåä Surf your favourite websites\n\nStep 4:\nüåê Check RYBN's Double Negative Capchas to see if you pass the bot test.\nhttps://1000scores.com/portfolio-items/rybn-double-negative-captchas/\n(Sometimes take the test twice until it works)\n\n1000 Bots is an art piece by !Mediengruppe Bitnik commissioned by the website 1000scores.com & Literaturforum im Brecht-Haus Berlin. \n\nThe source code for 1000 Bots is free software and published under the GNU GPLv3.\n\n<3 !Mediengruppe Bitnik"
