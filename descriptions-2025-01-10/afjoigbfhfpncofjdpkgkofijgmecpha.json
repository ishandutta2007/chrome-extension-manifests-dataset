Treat any number of web pages like flashcards in the Leitner System (Google it).  I mainly use it with Wikipedia pages.\n\nWhen a page is added, it's associated with a number of 'tickets', 10 by default.  Then click the 'next' button to go to a randomly-generated page. The probability of it being any given page is proportional to the number of tickets that page has been allocated.\n\nFor instance, if Page A has 10 tickets and Page B has 20 tickets, B will be generated with twice the frequency of A.  It's all relative - a ratio of 10:20 is equivalent to 1:2, is equivalent to 40:80.\n\nI'll try and explain the basic idea behind the Leitner System now.  As you're studying, if you end up at a page with content you feel you already know, then DECREASE the number of tickets it has (or delete it altogether).  If you get one where you've forgotten some or all of the content, then INCREASE the number of tickets it has.  Then, on average, you should end up reviewing less-familiar stuff more often.  Clear as mud?  Good then."
