Open the plugin's interface, type your desired text, and apply formatting using the top toolbar. You may also add a background picture or color to the text field. Once you've finished, hit - Convert - on the bottom right hand side of the screen to save your work as a PNG file on your computer. The installation location is determined by where you installed Pixlr Express 2 On Your PC earlier in this guide.) \n\nThe image displayed in your browser's title bar is not the desired size. You may notice that it fits very well for most webpages and blogs, but it won't work for all websites. If you wish to change the size of this addon's interface, be sure to reduce its width or height as needed (but not both). This add-on utilizes an opensource library called html2canvas to convert an HTML element into a picture."
