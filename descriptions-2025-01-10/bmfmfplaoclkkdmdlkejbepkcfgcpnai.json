Every time you visit a page which shows your balance the extension will record it. Then all you need to do is click the icon and you can see all your balances in one place.\n\nBecause BMB operates as an extension it doesn't need any of your credentials, keeping your earnings secure. Your balance history is stored locally in your browser so you can see your history even when offline.\n\nOn top of keeping your balances in one place BMB lets you graph your earnings over time and compare between sites to see which are most profitable. There's also a quick update button to get the latest balance without having to open the page yourself."
