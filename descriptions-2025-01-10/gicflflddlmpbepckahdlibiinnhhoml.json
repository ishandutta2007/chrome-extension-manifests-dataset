Never again let someone read your emails by mistake! Last time you'll look around a webpage to find the \"log out\" link hidden in a menu!\n\nWith this extension, one key combination is enough to log out.\n\nHaving a \"log out\" one key combination away means that you'll be much more likely to do it. And that means you're more likely to keep your account away from prying eyes.\n\n\nThis is a perfect complement to a password manager. I personally recommend 1Password: https://agilebits.com/onepassword\n\n\nNote for Windows users: after installation, please go to options and set a shortcut. For non alphanumeric characters, it might show a strange character for some reason. Do not pay attention to the display and you will be able to use the shortcut you actually pressed.\nFor example, choosing Alt+\\ will display \"Alt+Ãœ\". However, pressing the keys Alt+\\ will work just fine to log out. Sorry about the weird behavior.\n\n\n=================================\nExplanation of required permissions:\n=================================\n- \"Your data on all websites\": this permission is required because the extension needs to be able to run a script on any page. Any script run on a page technically has access to the data displayed.\n- \"Your tabs and browsing activity\": this permission is required to interact with the proper tab when logging out."
