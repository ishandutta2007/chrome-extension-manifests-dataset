Here are just some of the things you can find when you use the Microsoft Search extension:\n \n• People: connect with co-workers, see who they report to, what they’ve worked on recently, and more\n• Files: get quick access to your recent files and see what others have shared with you\n• Sites: find SharePoint sites and other internal pages you have access to\n• Org charts: explore the relationships between teams and connect with people faster\n• Answers: get links to popular resources and find answers to common work questions\n• Acronyms: get definitions for acronyms and abbreviations used across your organization\n• Conversations: find info shared in your private chats and see what others are saying in public conversations\n• Calendars: view your schedule for the day and see which meetings you have in common with co-workers\n \nWhen you search, you'll only see results from your organization that you can access. Also, none of the internal info or results are available to the public or other organizations, including Microsoft. To help protect you and your work info, sign in to the extension with the same work account you use for Outlook, SharePoint, or other Office apps."
