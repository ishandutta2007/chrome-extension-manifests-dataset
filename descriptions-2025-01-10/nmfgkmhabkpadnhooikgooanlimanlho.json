It will be used by Salesforce employees to use a variety of Salesforce debugging tools on daily basis to work on customer issues and manually feed in a lot of details from customer’s Org to those tools before we can actually start using them. \nTo reduce this manual effort ToolStore extension can be very useful. It’s a one-stop shop for all the debugging tools without the havoc of navigating separately to every tool for every Salesforce Org and providing the Org specific details every time.\nIt reads fetches few data from the Salesforce Page cookies and auto-populate a lot of details which otherwise has to be done manually making the job tedious and manual."
