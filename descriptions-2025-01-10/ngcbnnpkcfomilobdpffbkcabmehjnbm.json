In today's fast paced world, we can all benefit from a moment of recollection and contemplation. Do you really have time for one-more YouTube video after thirty \"one-mores?\" Is another trip to SSENSE or YesStyle really responsible when you have a 999+ inbox? We know Reddit is fun and (stan) Twitter is hilarious, but what about that one deadline and then a few?\n\nThese are the questions that are (or should be) on our minds when we click the innocent-looking and deviously alluring New Tab button, and we hope BREATHE helps you address those big questions that get lost in the hustle of daily life. Or perhaps it helps calm you down, which would be totally fabulous too."
