In recent weeks they have been getting worse and worse. Hopefully this plugin will help you identify sites using them. We have a list of sites and are trying to keep it up to date, NOTE: it is not a definitive list and is constantly changing. Please contact support if there is a site that needs listing or de-listing. Some sites are built in a way that hide our banner but we are working on fixing this."
