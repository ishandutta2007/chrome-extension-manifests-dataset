This extension helps you automatically close inactive tabs based on a time limit that you set. It ensures that you never exceed your preferred number of open tabs by closing the least active ones first.\n\nYou'll see a countdown timer next to each tab, showing how much time is left before it closes. A few seconds before closing, you’ll receive a warning notification (if Chrome notifications are enabled), so you’re never caught off guard.\n\nWant to keep certain tabs always open? Just pin them, and they will never close. Your active tabs will also stay open until they become inactive.\n\nWhen tabs are closed, they aren’t gone forever! Closed tabs are saved for 2–3 days, giving you time to revisit them if needed. You can easily restore them from the list of recently closed tabs, which are ordered by the most recent first."
