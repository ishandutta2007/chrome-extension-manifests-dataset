Enjoy these lovely enhancements to Plans:\n\n• Hit the \"q\" key to go to your quicklove page.\n• Hit the \"n\" key to read the bottommost plan in your currently selected autoread level.\n• Hit the \"m\" key to read the topmost plan in your currently selected autoread level.\n• Hit the \"1,\" \"2\" or \"3\" keys to switch between autoread levels.\n• Click on any non-Plans link and watch it open in a new tab/window.\n• Visit your quicklove page and get notified of what new planlove you have since the last time you visited the page, a.k.a. newlove. (Newlove should configure itself automagically the first time you visit your quicklove page after installing PlansPlus.)\n• Leave Plans open and watch as your autoread list periodically updates to let you know that you have new plans to read, you Plans addict you.\n• Visit your preferences page to customize how PlansPlus works."
