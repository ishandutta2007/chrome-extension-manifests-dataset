Clicking on the icon shows you an options page where you can choose which files/links types to capture (including a custom comma separated list of link prefixes/postfixes).\n\nNote: This is a beta version. I work on this project for fun and when I have free time.\n\nThe source code is available here: https://github.com/vicholz/Asus-Download-Master-Link-Handler\n\nChanges in 0.0.3:\n- Removed image replacement option. It only worked on some sites and looked weird on most others.\n- Cleaned up logic to run onclick instead of onload.\n\nChanges in 0.0.4:\n- Added workaround for links on https sites (cannot be opened in iframe). Opens in new tab/window instead). Going to test with xhr later but will probably have to keep it this way\n\nChanges in 0.0.5:\n- Switched to XHR, and cleaned up. Workaround for HTTPS sites has to stay as any attempts to open links on the same page that are not HTTP are blocked."
