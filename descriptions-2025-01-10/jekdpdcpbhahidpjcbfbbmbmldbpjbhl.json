Restore the power of right-click functionality effortlessly.\n\nDo you encounter frustrating situations where websites disable the right-click context menu, supposedly to protect their content? We believe this restriction is unwarranted. Unfortunately, Google Chrome lacks advanced options to manage JavaScript behavior on websites, unlike browsers such as Konqueror, Opera, or Firefox. If you share our stance, show your support by starring this extension.\n\nIn the meantime, our Context Menu Enabler extension provides a clever workaround. By resetting the oncontextmenu property to its default behavior on various webpage elements, you can once again enjoy the full functionality of the context menu. Moreover, this extension seamlessly works with popular platforms like Flickr and YouTube, enabling right-click interactions on HTML5 videos.\n\nIf you come across a site where the extension doesn't work, please report it in our bug tracker rather than in the comments section. Similarly, if the extension causes any issues on a website, kindly report it through the bug tracker. Your feedback plays a vital role in our continuous efforts to enhance and refine the extension's performance.\n\nWe appreciate your support and encourage positive comments. Let's restore the freedom of the context menu together!"
