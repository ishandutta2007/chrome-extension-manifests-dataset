Except Google Classroom.\n\nIntroducing Subgroups for Google Classroom, an extension that does not require any Google sign-in to create subgroups! Now, you, as an educator can assign 100+ students classwork in ONE CLICK. No more painfully finding and checking off every single student!\n\nIf you encounter any bugs, please report them in the \"Support\" section of this Chrome Extension homepage or email support@kennethchap.dev. And if you enjoy using this extension, please consider donating.\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=JXD88LGWVURLG\n\nCurrent Version: v1.1.1 (Clean UI Update)\n══════★ What's new in v1.1.1?  ★══════\nPatched security vulnerability and corrected import prompt wording.\n\n══════★ What's new in v1.1?  ★══════\n🎨 UI is now responsive to all screen sizes and is much cleaner!\nSince Google had updated Google Classroom, so did this extension.\n✉️ Added emails!\nIf your students have the same full name and profile picture, now you can tell who's who by looking at their email. Note that as of now, it takes 0.5 seconds to fully add a NEW student to the list. This means that if you have 100 students and this is your FIRST TIME loading them in all, it will take 50 seconds (however, if you have 99 students ALREADY loaded in and 1 new student, it would only take 0.5 seconds). This is a limitation that will be addressed in future updates.\n📦 Import and export your subgroups!\nWant to transfer your subgroups from one device to another or make subgroups using spreadsheets (especially Google Form results)? With the addition of these new buttons and step-by-step prompts, it makes this process much easier.\n🗑️ Clear your subgroups!\nHate clicking the trash button for every subgroup to start over? Now you can also do that in one click, no matter how many you have.\n\nDeveloped by Kenneth Chap at kennethchap.dev"
