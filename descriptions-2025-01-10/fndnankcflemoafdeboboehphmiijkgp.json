Shopify Theme Inspector for Chrome helps identify Liquid changes that are slowing your site down by providing a visualization of Liquid render profiling data, and giving you the means to triage the slowest parts of your Shopify theme.\n\nOnce you install this extension you should be able to sign in with your Shopify credentials and see a “Shopify” panel in Chrome DevTools. \n\nThis tool helps you visualize results as a flame graph which is readable and easy to understand.\nYou can examine the flame graph nodes to localize performance issues down to the exact file and line.\n\nA handy code snippet link will open up the exact line of Liquid in your admin code editor so you can view and edit the code in context.\n\nThis is the perfect tool to accelerate your workflow while debugging Liquid performance.\n\nIf you would like to learn more, contribute a feature, open an issue, or make a feature request you can check out the shopify/shopify-theme-inspector Github repository."
