Reduce information overload and enjoy a stress-free reading experience.\n\nâœ¨ Main Features:\n1. Utilizes AI to filter, summarize, and translate interesting sources, delivering a daily digest and making reading a routine.\n2. Combines powerful AI filters with comprehensive traditional filtering capabilities to help you focus on what truly interests you.\n3. Allows pausing at any level: the entire Tidyread, a specific topic, or a particular source.\n4. Provides the flexibility to plan topics and customize summary prompts by topic, offering more tailored content.\n5. Offers an efficient reading mode to keep your reading flow smooth.\n\nMoreover, we've worked hard to reduce your usage costs. For example, most scenarios filtered out by our filters wonâ€™t trigger an AI call. We also support dynamic prompts that can declare when the content is too large and only provide a portion to the AI for summarization. Our comprehensive usage control features allow you to set limits for daily or specific topic consumption.\n\nðŸ”‘ Keywords: \nAI RSS Reader\nAI Reader\nAI Summary Tool\nAI Filter\nRSS Filter"
