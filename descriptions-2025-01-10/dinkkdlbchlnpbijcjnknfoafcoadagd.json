Players control a character, starting with the iconic chicken, with the aim of crossing as many roads, railroads, and rivers as possible without meeting a tragic end. Crossy Road controls are straightforward: Arrow keys to move in any direction, with each tap propelling the character forward one block. \n\nOne of the Crossy Road most appealing features is its vast roster of characters. From the classic chicken to dragons, unicorns, and historical figures, there's a character for every taste. These characters are more than just visual variations; each comes with its unique sound effects and environments, enriching the gameplay experience. \n\nIf you have any questions about our Crossy Road Unblocked game extension or just want to give us some feedback, feel free to send us a message or write a review!
