Each line (horizontal or vertical) is processed separately. The algorithm begins with the pixel at one end and begins to record in an array all subsequent pixels having a lower or equal brightness. Once it finds a pixel with higher brightness, it sorts the array of pixels previously created in brightness order and starts a new array. And so on until the end of the line before moving on to the next line. Variations have been added in order to obtain different results."
