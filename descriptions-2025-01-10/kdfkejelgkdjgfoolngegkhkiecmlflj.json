We have received feedback from those affected that thanks Bionic Reading® because they immediately understood the content of various texts the first time, they read them, which was impossible without Bionic Reading®.\n\n\nCOMMENTS AND FEEDBACK.\nJessica: “Having ADHD and processing issues means that I read very slow because my brain can’t focus on the words enough to both read them and process what they mean at a decent pace. Using Bionic Reading® has allowed me to feel functional and productive when I’m reading something lengthy – it’s such a GAME CHANGER!”\n\nLisa: “I haven’t read fiction for 20 years. I read what I needed to read. It almost hurts my brain to read normal font. But now I’m going to read fiction again! Bionic Reading® works for me and I can read 2–3 times faster! AMAZING! This is a LIFE CHANGER! Thank you so much!”\n\nPatrick: “OK, Bionic Reading® is the real deal. I already read quickly, but I read twice as fast with Bionic Reading®.”\nReaction from Daniel: “You’re not joking!”\n\nCarla: “WOW! I was able to read quickly and fluently with Bionic Reading®. It allowed me to understand the context of the paragraph much better than when I have to squint and focus on every word, which not only tires me out, but also makes me lose track of what I'm reading. Bionic Reading® is brilliant!”\n\nNestor: “Your tool is gorgeous, it’s helping me a lot. My sight is reduced because one of my transplanted corneas has become opaque and Bionic Reading® is helping me a lot to read easier and comprehend faster.”\n\n\nTYPOGRAPHY. DESIGN.
