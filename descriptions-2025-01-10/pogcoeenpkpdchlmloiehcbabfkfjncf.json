Each time you open a new tab, a random image from the album will load (unless you're offline where a fallback will be used).\n\nPlease submit new images for the imgur album through the issue tracker on Github!\n\nThis app is very new, and there's lots of room for improvement! I am probably going to add support for local weather on the page, and conduct an analysis on caching data for faster load upon opening a page.\n\nThanks for looking! :-) Check out the project on Github if you're a developer."
