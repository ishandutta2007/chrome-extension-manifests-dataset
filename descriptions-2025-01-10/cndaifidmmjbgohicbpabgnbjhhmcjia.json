Whether youâ€™re a developer, designer, or just someone looking to visually enhance the layout of a page, Focus Frame helps you focus on key elements by highlighting them with an eye-catching border.\n\nFeatures:\n\nDynamic Border Toggle: Easily add or remove borders around semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and more.\nTab-Specific State: The extension maintains its toggle state per tab, ensuring that the borders on one tab do not affect others. You can toggle borders independently for each open tab.\nInstant Feedback: Toggle borders with a single click on the extension icon, and see immediate results on your active tab.\nNon-Intrusive: Uses outline instead of border to avoid altering the layout or positioning of elements on the page. This makes it a seamless tool to enhance content visibility without disrupting the original design.\nHow it Works:\n\nAdd Borders: Click the Focus Frame icon to add vibrant borders around semantic elements on the page, such as navigation bars, sections, articles, and footers.\nRemove Borders: Click the icon again to remove the borders and restore the page to its original state.\nTab Isolation: Each tab has its own independent state, so you can toggle the borders on a tab without affecting others.\nUse Cases:\n\nWeb Developers: Quickly visualize the layout of semantic elements and debug the structure of web pages.\nUI/UX Designers: Preview how various layout elements are positioned and help identify areas that may need attention.\nGeneral Users: Enhance your browsing experience by focusing on specific page sections like headers or footers.\nWhether you're debugging, designing, or just want a better way to visually organize web pages, Focus Frame provides an easy-to-use solution that adds clarity to your digital environment."
