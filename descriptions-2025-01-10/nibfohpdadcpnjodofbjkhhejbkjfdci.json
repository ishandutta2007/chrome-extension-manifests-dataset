The App allows users to scan documents or import them from a users PC or Salesforce record, manipulate or annotate each page within the document(s) and save a page or group of pages to a variety of Salesforce records.\n\nThe Docusplit App is widely used across a variety of organizations within the Salesforce eco-system. The most common use cases are represented by a need to scan or extract physical or digital documents securely.\n\nSalesforce users who require a high level of security, especially those within the government or medical industry will benefit from Docusplits native functionality. Users can scan physical documents directly into Salesforce, bypassing the requirement to save scanned items to a users local PC. Further, users can manipulate documents by blacking-out or cropping sensitive information while annotating or highlighting other data points within the documents.\n\nOrganizations that choose to benefit from the streamlining functions of Docusplit can choose not just from the scanning functions provided, but by its import functions as well. The two import functions, Import from PC and Import from Salesforce are most commonly used by organizations that receive PDF or image (jpg, png, etc) files directly into Salesforce or via email. Those documents can be opened within Salesforce and routed to their corresponding records.\n\nAs an example, many organizations, especially loan providers and shipping logistic providers receive due diligence documents and bills/shipping documents from customers and/or vendors via portals. Those documents can be received in Salesforce and channeled within seconds post-review.\n\nThe purpose of the Docusplit Chrome Extension is to allow Docusplit users to rasterize PDF's without transmitting the PDF data to external services."
