If you're used to reading justified text in academic journals, it can often be difficult to adjust to non-justified text seen on many websites. This extension allows you to immediately justify all text either by clicking the icon or through the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + J on Windows and Cmd + Shift + J on Mac). You can reverse the justification as easily as you enabled it by hitting the keyboard shortcut again or clicking the extension icon!"
