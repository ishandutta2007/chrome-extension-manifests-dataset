New!\n\nMore features to come! Such as tree styled tabs! Stay tuned!\n\nSome known problems:\n- Vertical Tabs only works on regular html pages (which is 99% of the time). However, it doesn't work on your Newtab page, chrome web store pages, or PDF pages. Unfortunately that's the way it works in chrome, and there's no known way to get around it currently.\n- It works by injecting an iframe into a webpage. Therefore, zooming in/out on the page will cause the vertical tabs to become large/small. There's no way to get around this.\n- Please refresh the page after a version update. For example, when you find that the toggling functionality gave up working, it's most probably I updated the version, and refreshing the web pages (using Cmd + R / Ctrl + R) should fix it.\n\nThank you!\n\n\nBuilt with React, Webpack, and love by @lxieyang."
