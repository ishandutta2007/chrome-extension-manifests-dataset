As a fellow procrastinator, let me tell you that this works really well when you need to get stuff done. That's probably why close to every\n\nThe extension is modeled after parts of Apple's Screen Time feature, which supports blocking apps based on a schedule with the option of allowing yourself breaks when you want them. \n\nFeatures:\nâ€¢ Define any websites you like as distractions and block them by enabling the extension's block mode in the popup or the options page\nâ€¢ Easily add or remove current website from the blocklist via the extension popup\nâ€¢ Schedule your distraction-free times to match up with your work hours. This includes support for work hours that span multiple days, such as night shifts (optional)\nâ€¢ Define different length breaks for when you want to read the latest news stories while you have lunch or listen to a bit of a podcast while you go get some fresh coffee (optional, coffee not included ðŸ˜‹)\nâ€¢ Use Pomodoro Timers to be reminded to take a break automatically\nâ€¢ Reload your tabs when your distraction-free time starts or ends to immediately interrupt any currently distracting activity you're doing. If you leave this disabled, the extension will only kick in when you visit another distracting site in that tab so it will not, for example, interrupt playing YouTube videos (optional, requires additional permission)\nâ€¢ Show notifications one minute before your scheduled distraction-free time is about to start or end or when it does start and end (optional, requires additional permission)\n\nBut this type of extension already exists many times, why another? Well, none of them matched exactly what I wanted from such an extension. \nPlus, I didn't like that other similar extensions I found are requesting a lot more permissions than seem to be necessary for this task. A malicious or even just faulty extension can cause a lot of harm, so I see it as essential to minimize the permission the extension requires.\n\nNote that this free extension is a side project that I'm pursuing in my spare time. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please use the project repo's issue tracker."
