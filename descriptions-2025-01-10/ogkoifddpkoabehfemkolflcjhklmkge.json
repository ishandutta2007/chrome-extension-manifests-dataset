Features are turned off by default - explore the extension's Popup and Options page and enable the ones you need. After installation, reload all YouTube pages!\n\nFast forward, rewind, navigate chapters, control volume, speed, and more (50+ actions) with an unlimited number of custom mouse controls (hover over different areas of the video and use mouse wheels or buttons) and keyboard shortcuts. Use global keyboard shortcuts to control active video from any app.\n\nTurn on the \"Auto Gain\" feature to balance sound levels across different videos by making quieter videos louder. One of the audio channels is quieter or missing? Just turn on the \"Mono Mix\". Use the \"High Pass Filter\" to make muddy audio with too much bass clearer. If the volume is still too low, there is a \"Boost Volume\" feature.\n\nMake player controls always visible, hidden, visible only on mouse hover, or show only a minimalist progress bar. Auto-hide them in less than the default 3 seconds. Customize volume and time display and base time on the current playback rate.\n\nComplete features list: inzk.dev/tweaks-for-youtube/features\n\nSupport me on Patreon: patreon.com/inzkdev\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrivacy Policy\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis extension does not collect personal data from users, and it does not send any user data to a remote server.
