When the user navigates to a website that contains videos, the extension detects the video format (M3U8, html, javascript, iframe player, streaming formats), and parallel processes the segmented streams using multithreading. Each segmented stream is assigned to a separate service worker, which allows the extension to preload, accelerate and fully buffer the stream. \n\nThe extension also merges the Youtube Player API and hardware concurrency to detect the number of cores in the user's processor and allocate all resources to Youtube. This ensures that the video playback is smooth and does not lag. \n\nTo use the extension, the user simply needs to click on the \"Tube Chip\" icon and download and it will be applied automatically when viewing stream. To uninstall go into chrome://extensions and press Remove."
