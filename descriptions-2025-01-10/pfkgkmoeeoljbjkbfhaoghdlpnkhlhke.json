Batches similar meetings together. This minimizes context switching and time lost between meetings. Handles all logistics around finding the perfect time between meeting attendees.\n2. Finds and fixes ineffective meetings. Run anonymized feedback loops with attendees asking if this meeting was the best use of their time without revealing their identities.\n3. Time blocks your tasks. Automatically find perfect spaces in your calendar for your tasks.\n4. Snoozes distractions. Slack goes to sleep when you focus."
