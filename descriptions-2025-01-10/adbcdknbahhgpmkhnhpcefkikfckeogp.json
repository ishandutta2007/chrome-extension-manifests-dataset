This extension allows you to choose options of early warning and prevention against log out. \n\n********\nNOW SUPPORTS MULTIPLE TABS\n********\n\nMessage from sgtkode:\n    I made this extension primarily because I was just fed up with the annoying idle log out system on Edline. This extension will send you notifications before you are going to be logged out, or automatically refresh the site for you. However, it's a quick fix and might have a few bugs. If you have any problems or suggestions, please send feedback and I'll get back to you as quick as possible\n\nThanks for supporting,\nSean"
