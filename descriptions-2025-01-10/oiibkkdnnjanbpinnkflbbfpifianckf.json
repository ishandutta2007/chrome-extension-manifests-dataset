They provide protection, but passwords can be a real pain to keep track of.\n\nThe PASSPORT app makes password management easier and safer than ever.\n\nThe Password Problem\nQ: The average person juggles 10 passwords across 100+ websites and online accounts.\nQ: Most people use (and re-use) weak password patterns hoping to make them easier to remember.\nQ: Password managers help, but store your data in ways that are prone to hacking. And what's scarier than having your password hacked? Having ALL your passwords hacked.\n\nThe PASSPORT Solution\nA: Login to any website and your Passport saves your password. You don't have to enter your password to that site again, even on other devices.\nA: Unlock your Passport using your smartphone with a convenient face or thumbprint scan.\nA: Using blockchain technology, your passwords are NOT stored anywhere hackers can break into them. They’re also protected by a secret key that only YOU have access to.\n\nHighest Level of Data Protection\nThere are dozens of password managers out there,\nbut none protect your data like PASSPORT.\n\n- Your data is never stored in a single place or central server that criminals can hack.\n- PASSPORT hides your data everywhere in an impenetrable way that would take even the most powerful computers decades to figure out (AES-256 Encryption).\n- You have total data ownership because it's locked down by your Master Key. Without your key, no one can recover your account access... Not even our PASSPORT team.\n- Blockchain technology prevents anyone from altering or destroying your data.\n\nDitch the ‘Forgot My Password Link\n- Once you save a website password in PASSPORT, you won’t have to enter it again, even on your other devices.\n- Log in to PASSPORT instantly and securely with a face or thumbprint scan.\n- Import credentials from your current password manager… PASSPORT is the last you’ll ever need. Passwords sync across your devices, so you’ll never have to worry about remembering a password again."
