It is intended as a modern alternative to the legacy ScrapBook add-on. All archived content is accessible on the Android platform if shared through a cloud service. Scrapyard also supports the import of RDF archives of the legacy ScrapBook. See the online help for a more detailed description of the add-on features: https://tinyurl.com/scrapyard-help .\n\nThe add-on has two storage modes:\n\n- Filesystem - in this mode, all archived content is stored inside a user-specified directory in the filesystem. This mode requires the installation of the Scrapyard backend application.\n- Browser internal storage - in this mode, all archived content is stored inside the browser profile. Although the installation of the backend application is not required, some advanced features, such as archive toolbar, RDF import, or uploading of local files, are not available without it due to restrictions imposed by the WebExtensions API.\n\nPlease see the extension help for more details.\n\nQ&A\n\nQ: If I choose the \"Browser internal storage\" mode, how can I physically access the archived content?\nA: In this case, the archived content is stored in IndexedDB and is managed by the browser. It is not intended for access through the filesystem. Please use Scrapyard import/export facilities to migrate existing bookmarks. If you are into backup, please backup your entire Chrome profile. The path to the current Chrome profile could be found on the chrome://version/ page. Note that in this mode, all archived data is removed when the add-on is uninstalled.\n\nQ: I've lost all my data. What can I do?\nA: Generally, nothing could be done about this. There may be bugs in Scrapyard, cloud file version conflicts, OS crashes, hardware failures, your antivirus may mess with IndexedDB, a cat may eat it. Please back up your data regularly, possibly using third-party software for automation.\n\nQ: Suddenly, a half of my data went missing. It seems, that items have disappeared randomly. Is there any hope?\nA: These are signs that the index file of the filesystem storage was corrupted by a faulty disk operation. Although the probability of this is pretty low, there are no technical means to prevent this from happening. This may happen when the browser crashes or exits at an inappropriate moment. Luckily, the storage index could be completely restored with the \"Rebuild item index\" link at the \"Advanced\" settings tab.\n\nQ: My browser says: \"The native application on port 20202 is not available\" what does this mean?\nThis means that the port used by the native application web server is taken by some other application or an already running instance of the native application from an another browser. This may happen if the browser has crashed. There are several possible solutions of this issue. At first, try to reboot the computer. If this does not help, it is possible to change the native application port in the Scrapyard settings."
