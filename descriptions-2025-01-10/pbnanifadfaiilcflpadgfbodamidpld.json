Hide any non-commercial posts. Limit the feed to  advertisements. Display only sponsored content and paid advertisements. Block user-generated content and filter out organic content. \n\nFacebook shows all posts and also only ads only transiently. To preserve viewed ads, the extension copies all the ads to a new tab and saves to the browser storage. \n\nA direct permanent link to the Facebook ad is shown above every copied ad.\n\nThe URLs of the videos shown in ads are restored so that the videos can be downloaded using the standard Save video as... menu option.\n\nCollected ads can be saved as a web page using the standard context menu option Save as... Links, videos and images are preserved in saved ads. Each ad is saved with a link to the source ad in the Facebook. \n\nYou can the ads collected during the current run or all the unique ads that have been ever collected by the extension since its first run.\n\nStarting from the next version it will be possible to download the complete source data of collected ads as a well structured excel file with ids, text content and URLs.\n\nThe extension is turned on and off by clicking its icon. Non-ads are hidden reversibly. If you turn off the extension, the hidden posts will reappear.\n\nYou can choose in the options to start the extension automatically when you open or reload Facebook page.\n\nSeeing only sponsored ads on Facebook helps you focus solely on relevant advertisements. A feed filled exclusively with ads might be less distracting than a mix of organic posts and advertisements. It is easier to analyze the impact of your campaigns without the interference of organic content. \n  \nThe extension is free and open-source. Keep in mind that Facebook keeps evolving and the extension's code needs to be updated to match those changes. Please report if it does not work. And do not hesitate to suggest a feature. The feedback form can be access through the options page."
