You can control your character and its color also influences the color of objects that you need to pick up. You also need to avoid objects of other colors, since picking them up would lead to you losing those of your color and once you lose all of them, it's game over. There are also places where the color can change rapidly and you will have to react quickly to pick up the correct object. Good luck!"
