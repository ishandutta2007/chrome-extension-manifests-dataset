This aims to make it easier to read for everyone that can benefit from it, such as people with dyslexia.\n\nFixed in 0.6: Updated to work with some layout changes Twitch has made that affected changed column widths.\n\nNew in 0.5: Hide emotes, grouped with hide badges for sightless users. Underline links. Contrast indicators for text and link color. Change saturation and contrast on emotes.\n\nNew in 0.4: Incremental control using sliders, more control over the use of colors including setting custom colors for background, text, and links.\n\nNew in 0.3: Fonts from Google fonts! 10 popular fonts have been pre-selected, and it is possible to use your favorite Google Font simply by typing in the name.\n\nAll options are on one page (the extension options page). After changes are made, any open Twitch stream would need to be refreshed to see these changes.\n\nA preview and autosaving has been implemented in version 0.3.\n\nTo find the options page, right-click on the plugin icon to the right of the search / navigation bar and select Options. Version 0.3 also adds 2 buttons under the chat message field. The first will open the options page, and the second will dynamically reload and apply the settings without reloading the page (and losing chat history).\n\nIncludes an option for a lighter (non black) background color in darkmode since version 0.2."
