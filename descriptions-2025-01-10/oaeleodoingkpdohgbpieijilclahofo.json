The display so you can install the extension and forget about it, since it won't interfere with the video.\n\nIt's useful when if you wonder each time how long the video becomes when applying playback speed. Also if you're a big playback speed user and want to have more fun with it using a slider (set playback speed to 0x or increase it up to 16x with fain grained steps of 0.05x).\n\nCurrently only YouTube is supported\n\n- What's new in 1.2.0:\nThe exstention now works with any Playback speed extention that changes youtube video speed! allowing you to use your favorite extention and supercharge it with this one\n\nHappy watching!"
