Examples: Mailchimp - Facebook Profile, Page and Groups - Facebook Ads - Twitter Tweets and Mentions - LinkedIn Profile and Business - LinkedIn Ads - Google+ Profile and Page. General websites, forums and blogs are tagged with UTM Medium 'referral' and the active browser tab URL as UTM Source.\n\nContribute to the Autotagging database by sharing the specific marketing channels and tools that your business requires. \n\nBenefit from the UTM Content tag by using the visual 'Content Variations' editor to create several variations of one UTM tracking link.\n\nCustomise your UTM tracking URLs by using any type of custom link parameter.\n\nAdd value to Google Analytics, Kissmetrics and Mixpanel by using Autotagging Google URL Builder to create your tracking links and get virtually 100% data integrity in your omnichannel RoI reports.\n\n\nGoogle™ Trademark\n\nWe declare no affiliation or sponsorship, with the Google™ trademark. We stand independently as the sole creators, operators, and engineers behind the Autotagging Google URL Builder."
