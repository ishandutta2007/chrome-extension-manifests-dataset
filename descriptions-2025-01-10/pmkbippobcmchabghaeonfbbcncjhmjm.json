This extension enables you to create, use and manage custom filters, in addition to some other handy features such as a Dates menu and ability to import multiple filters.\n\nðŸ†• Now supporting GitHub Enterprise domains ðŸŽ‰\nðŸ†• Now also showing on global Issues and PRs pages ðŸŽ‰\n\n==================== â˜…â˜…â˜… Features â˜…â˜…â˜… =====================\n\nâœ” Create, Edit, Delete\nâœ” Search within\nâœ” Pin and unpin\nâœ” Import from any Gist (beta)\nâœ” Backup to your own Gist (beta)\nâœ” GitHub Enterprise domains support (beta)\n\nâ˜… ðŸ†• Backup and import (beta)\nIf you ever wanted a backup of your saved filters, you can back them up to your own secret Gist. Should you want to share that Gist ID with someone, they can then import your filters to use themselves. This works great for teams, if you all frequently make the same searches.\n\nâ˜… Change scope for each filter\nShow your filter either only on the current repository you're in or show it on all repos and also on global issues/pull request pages.\n\nâ˜… Pin your most used filters\nIf you have several filters you use daily, pin them to the top of the filters menu for easy access.\n\nâ˜… Dates menu\nSimplifies adding dates to and removing dates from your queries.\n\nâ˜… Handy popup when pinned to your extensions bar\nProvides quick links to the docs, options and repos you have created filters for. Also shows you when there are new changes/features enabled.\n\n\n============== â˜…â˜…â˜… You own your own data â˜…â˜…â˜… ===============\nAll filters you create are synced with your Chrome account, so no need to \nlogin or provide an access token (unless you want to use the backup or \nimport features). Everything is right there where you need it to be, and \nupdates across your devices automatically. \n\nThis extension does not access any non-GitHub/external API's, databases \nor servers. What you see is achieved by manipulating the DOM and \ntriggering GitHub's own requests to apply your selected filter/query to \nrender the correct results. \n\nYour data is your own; it is tied to your own personal Chrome account, and\nyou own GitHub Gist(s), should you choose to use the backup feature. Thus\nwhy the only permission needed for this extension is \"storage\".\n============================================================"
