Please use it at your own risk for experiments/development purposes only.\n\nDisCORS comes with 2 modes: ACTIVATED or DEACTIVATED.\n\nDEACTIVATED Mode: You can DEACTIVATE the extension anytime to disable the security header bypass and go back to your normal browsing experience. DisCORS will not interfere with any of your browsing settings.\n\nACTIVATED Mode: You can ACTIVATE the extension anytime to enable the security header bypass. DisCORS will modify/remove the appropriate security header based on your configuration.\n- CORS headers: If enabled, DisCORS will bypass Access-Control-Allow-Origin & Access-Control-Allow-Methods header for the responses from targeted sites.\n- COOP/COEP/CORP: If enabled, DisCORS will bypass Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy & Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy & Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header for the responses from targeted sites.\n- X-Frame-Options: If enabled, DisCORS will bypass X-Frame-Options header for the responses from targeted sites.\n- Content-Security-Policy: If enabled, DisCORS will bypass Content-Security-Policy header for the responses from targeted sites.\n- Permissions-Policy: If enabled, DisCORS will bypass Permissions-Policy header for the responses from targeted sites.\n\nUser can specify a list of target sites (or leave the list empty to target ALL sites) and only the responses from the targeted sites will be modified."
