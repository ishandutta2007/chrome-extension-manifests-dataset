I've tried to stop, but I'm pretty sure my fingers have it on autopilot. This extension was originally designed to redirect to The Guardian every time I tried to visit The Daily Mail website.\n\nTo celebrate many months of being Daily Mail free, I've now extended DM Redirect so it can block and redirect to any sites you like. To change settings, just click the extension icon.\n\nIt still tracks absolutely nothing except to identify when you type the name of a blocked site in your url bar."
