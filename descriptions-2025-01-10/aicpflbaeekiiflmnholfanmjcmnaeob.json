This means that a person suffering from color blindness has trouble seeing red, green, blue, or a combination.\n\nA person's ability to see color is rarely lost (it is called monochromacy). Many people believe that only black and white colors are seen to a person suffering from color blindness. This is a misconception. There are many different types and levels of color blindness.\n\nAccording to the survey, the prevalence of color blindness is 8% in men and only 0.5% in women.\n\n----------------- How to Test Color Blindness? ----------------- \n\nThere are many ways to test color vision defects but among all of them the ishihara plate test is common method. this will test red-green color blindness. This test most likely used for regular color vision in government jobs, schools or medicals.\n\nThe ishihara test includes 38 plates of circles which are created by unique random dots in more than one colors. The place will shown to the person, and asked which number will be seen on plate.\n\nSome of the plates contain info which people with normal color blindness vision can see. On the other side, other plates contain info that only people with color blindness have understand or see.\n\nIf person makes some mistakes during test, then they are diagnosed with color blindness. Special plates are used to diagnose color blindness in kids.\n\n----------------- Types of colored plates in blindness test ----------------- \n\n1. Demonstration plate - The demonstration plate is the first plate in the Ishihara test with the number\"12\" and can be\"16\". This demonstration plate is seen by all individuals having normal color vision or deficient color vision. It is only used for demonstration purposes and not considered in making a score for screening purposes.\n\n2. Transformation plates - People with normal color vision can distinguish different figures or numbers from people suffering from color vision defects.\n\n3. Vanishing plates - Only people with normal color vision can see vanishing plates. i.e., Figures or numbers on the plates can ot seen by color vision defective people.\n\n4. Hidden digit plates - Figures and numbers on these plates can be seen only by people with color vision defects.\n\n5. Diagnostic plates - These plates help diagnose the type of color vision defect protanopia (red deficiency) or deuteranopia (green deficiency) and its severity."
