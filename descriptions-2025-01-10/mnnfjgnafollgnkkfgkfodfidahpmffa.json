Now there is an easy way to find out. The Xposer extension makes it convenient to call out to the xposer.io API from the website you are currently viewing. Just click the extension icon and click 'Expose'. The product and exact version of the website you are viewing will be revealed to you.\n\nAs a developer you can use this information to offer the owner of the site an upgrade of the detected product.\n\nAs a site owner you can check if you are running the most recent version of the product.\n\nThe version is not gleaned from the meta tags of the website, but by checking of key characteristics of each known product.\n\n- Wordpress\n- Drupal\n- Joomla\n- TYPO3\n- Concrete 5\n\nMore products and capabilities will be added in the near future."
