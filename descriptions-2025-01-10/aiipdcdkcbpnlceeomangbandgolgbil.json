The Internet today has some of the best content ever. It's filled with information for learning, entertaining, and everything in between. With all of its benefits, the internet is also full of distractions and addicting experiences that get us to stay online longer and more often. \n\nOur online routine gets so strong that the experience even creates instinct and muscle memory. Think about it. Have you ever opened a new tab and typed in YouTube without meaning to? Or have you associated free time with scrolling Twitter? Or have you opened Instagram for the 7th time in an hour just because?\n\nTake a Breath helps you add intention to your online surfing. To break up that instinct and muscle memory, you're asked to take a breath before accessing your site. You can also add other mindful activities like journaling or mood tracking. Here's how it works: \n\n1. Add sites to your list. \n2. Add settings to your pause page. The default setting is a 3 second breath.  Other settings include journaling or mood tracking.\n3. Access your site and encounter your pause. \n4. Pause and complete your mindful activity. \n5. Access your site!\n\nAll your data is stored locally and private to you. I cannot access or see your data at all. So you don't need to worry about me tracking your data or selling your data. \n\nTake a Breath is 100% free to use. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please reach out to me at allison.thesidekickapp@gmail.com. I'm happy to help! \n\nThank you for giving it a try! Cheers to your mindful surfing!\n\n--- Disclaimer --- \nTake a Breath is a part of the Ahero app suite. We aim to build tools that help protect your time online. Happy focusing!"
