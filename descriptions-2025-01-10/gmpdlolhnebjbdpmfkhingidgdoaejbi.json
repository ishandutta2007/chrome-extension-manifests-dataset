This extension will also remove any responses to him because any time spent replying to him is a waste of time as well.  Just imagine how much better your life would be if he wasn't part of it.\n\nNEW v1.2 - Updated for the new Warriors World site style.  IMPORTANT: you will need to reset and settings from the old version (such as hiding a single user).\n\nTo update your settings:\n\n1. Go to your extensions in Chrome (from the settings menu, or just put chrome://chrome/extensions/ in the url bar).\n2. Scroll to the \"Hide gsw_hoops\" extension and click \"options\".\n3. Type in the username.\n4. Go to the forums.  If you already have warriorsworld.net open in your browser you will have to refresh the page."
