Like me, you probably had to click each thumbnail, then click on Back, then click on the next thumbnail and so on...  No more! With iSlide you get to watch all the large photos with one click! Just click the iSlide icon in the Chrome Extensions toolbar and a photo slideshow based on the currently selected tab will open in a new tab!\n\nSupports: \n* Google Images, Instagram, Tumblr, Wikipedia and more!\n* Any page with image links.\n* Pages with links to image container pages (like Wikipedia for example).\n* Ability to recognize images that are not linked as images.\n\nFeatures\n* Saving all the photos to disk.\n* Hotkeys (checkout the options page for the full details)\n* 2 viewing modes\n* Customization via an options page\n* Incognito support(*).\n\n(*) In order to use iSlide in incognito mode you need to allow it to do so on the Extensions management page.\n\nUpcoming Features:\n\n* I am working on Facebook support, but can't promise anything yet as Facebook changes their page structure often.\n\nI am always striving to improve iSlide especially in terms of compatibility. My goal is for the generic algorithm to manage as many sites as possible. If you have a feature request or you've found any pages that donâ€™t work properly or any other bug, please comment below or email them to:\n\niSlideShow@gmail.com\n\nEnjoy!\n\np.s.\n* I find that toggling full screen with F11 combines great with iSlide. Try it!\n\n\nLatest updates: (See options page for more details)\n\nVersion 4.1.0 - January 10, 2020\n-------------------------------------------------\n*Improved: Instagram support.\n*Improved: Non image link detection now better informs user of loading progress.\n*Fixed: Image count badge not showing before starting a slideshow.\n*Fixed: Removed a control from the options page that slipped in by mistake.\n*Fixed: Some other small bug fixes\n\nVersion 4.0.0 - December 31, 2019 - Last version of the decade!\n-------------------------------------------------\n*Improved: Non image link detection.\n*Fixed: Broken Wikipedia support.\n*Fixed: Broken Google Images support.\n*Fixed: Bug that broke the app on some secure sites.\n*Added: Controls can now be toggled and close with the up and down arrows respectively.\n*Added: Controls toggling is now animated.\n*Added: Instagram support. (currently working slowly and without progress indication. Improved support coming soon.)\n*Changed: Moving the mouse will only make controls reappear if moving in the lower 15% of the window."
