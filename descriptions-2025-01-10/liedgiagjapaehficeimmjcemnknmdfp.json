It collects 600+ most popular ones, pinpoints the version, and reveals those hidden by web packers or obfuscators. \n\nUsage: open a website, click on the icon of this extension (needs to be pinned in the extension bar in advance), and click on the \"detect\" button in the popup menu, then all the libraries loaded by the website will be displayed.\n\nAll the detection features used in this extension are auto-generated by the algorithm proposed in recent research papers, ensuring the soundness of detection results. More libraries will be covered in later releases. For further information visits GitHub: https://github.com/aaronxyliu/PTV. Feedback please send to aaronxyliu@gmail.com."
