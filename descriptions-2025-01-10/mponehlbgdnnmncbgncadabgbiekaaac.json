Well, then you need the Substack Paywall Warning plugin, a plugin commissioned by Paul Crowley to make sure no other human ever has to experience that frustration again. It adds a dismissible banner that slides in from the top of the page when loading a Substack.com post or self-hosted Substack page that has a paywall. \n\nThere are no settings, just install it and check a post with a paywall and you will see a banner on the top of your browser that can be dismissed on click. \n\n*Not in any way affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Substack Inc.
