This is commonly referred to as the \"gap effects\". When we take those short breaks, our brain re-plays the neural patterns of the skill (motor or otherwise) backwards at 10-20X the speed. The result is a great boost in learning speed and retention.\n\nWith the HIIL Timer, you have the option to explore different focus-to-rest patterns that suit you best.\n\nThe most studied pattern is 1:1 focus-to-rest ratio (typically 10 seconds of rest per every 10 second of focused practice). This is great for learning new motor patterns like chord progressions and such.\n\nDr Andrew Huberman from Stanford University recommends a 10:1 focus-to-rest ratio at around 10 seconds of rest per every 2 mins of focused learning of the study material. This is really intense, but also really effective for reading or watching videos with very dense material.\n\nUltimately, its a good idea to explore your ideal ratio and focus bout length so you can optimize your study sessions as you see fit.\n\nTake control of your study habits down to the minute with the HIIL Timer!\n\nHow to use:\n    Total Time = How long you'll study/practice for\n    Focus Time = How long you'll focus before the rest interval\n    Rest Time = How long the rest interval will be\n\nThen click \"Start\" and start focusing. The timer will tell you when it's time for a short break with a bell sound and push notification."
