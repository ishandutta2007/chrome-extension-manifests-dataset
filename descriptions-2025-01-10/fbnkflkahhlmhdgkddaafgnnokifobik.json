Messed up CSS so that things are out of whack? \n\nOf course. We all have. (It’s ok!)\n\nSo how can this help?\n\nApplitools for Selenium IDE, or SIDE Eyes for short, lets you incorporate visual UI testing into your Selenium IDE automated test scripts. \n\n(If you’re not familiar with Selenium IDE, head over to https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/)\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSIDE Eyes lets you insert visual checkpoints into your Selenium IDE script. The first time you run one of these checkpoints, it grabs a baseline screenshot of whatever web page Selenium IDE is on.\n\nEvery subsequent time you run one of those checkpoints, SIDE Eyes grabs a new screenshot, then sends it off to Applitools’ find any visual differences. \n\nOn the Applitools website, you can see all your screenshots and all their visual differences. \n\nEven better, we render your web page on a bunch of different browser viewport sizes, on both Chrome and Firefox, using our Visual Grid (https://applitools.com/visualgrid). This lets you find bugs in responsive web pages more easily.\n\nFor each visual bug we find, we show you the handful of CSS or DOM lines that most likely caused the bug, using our Root Cause Analysis feature (https://applitools.com/rca). This can save you HOURS of debugging time.\n\nIs this just pixel comparison?\n\nNot at all. We use a Visual AI engine to find only differences that the human eye will detect. That means no more annoying off-by-a-pixel false alarms to waste your time.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nCheck out our tutorial https://applitools.com/tutorials/selenium-ide.html"
