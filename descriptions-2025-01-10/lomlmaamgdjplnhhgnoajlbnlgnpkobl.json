Please note that if you close the tab that contains the video, the floating popup window will be closed as well. This addon uses the new JavaScript API called \"picture-in-picture\". It currently works in all modern browsers. It is important to note that, the floating window will stay on top of other windows.\n\nNote: please play the video first and then click on the toolbar button to make it pop out. A paused or stopped video element, will not respond to the pop-out request. To change this behavior, please visit the extension options page and adjust the settings.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/video-popout.html)."
