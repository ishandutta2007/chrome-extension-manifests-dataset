But as a new user, you should install the updated Vereign for Gmail (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vereign-for-gmail/egmmigeohgnjibhiaabhmiaajkfnemnj) extension instead. \n\nIMPORTANT: Do not install both extensions at the same time!\n\nThis extension was our first prototype to connect Gmail with a Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) under control of the user. It generally works, and taught us many lessons which went into the new Vereign for Gmail extension. The new extension does not yet have all the same functionality this extension did, but it is going to make it much easier for new users to embark on the path toward SSI.\n\nWe will keep this extension around until the new extension can fully replace it. We will then remove this extension and ask everyone to switch to the new version instead.\n\nIn the meantime, please note that the new extension has gone a long way, so please do consider to take a step back and start using it instead. \n\nFor questions or comments, please visit https://community.vereign.com."
