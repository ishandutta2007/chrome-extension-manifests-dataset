If you find that using certain websites makes your eyes uncomfortable then this extension should help you. \n\nDull Mode does not apply a true 'dark mode' - instead it simply reduces the brightness of webpages.\n\nOptions:\nYou can choose how dark you want the webpages to be.\nYou can also easily exclude specific webpages.\n\nKnown Issues:\n─────────\nDull Mode is not always able to adjust dynamically added web page content.\n\nGoogle locks down certain web pages for security reasons.\nThis means that Dull Mode does not work with the following webpages:\n● New (empty) Chrome tabs\n● chromewebstore.google.com (ironically)\n● chrome.google.com\nBut Dull Mode does work on Google Search, Drive and Docs."
