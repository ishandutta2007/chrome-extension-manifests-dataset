Through the web interface, you can easily view and manage these registered services. \n\nHowever, for many companies, after registering the service in consul, if you need to copy the ip and port of the service from the ui interface, it is very inconvenient to operate, and this operation is very common for developers and testers. So this tool does this. \n\nWe added three buttons swagger, env and copy on top of each service. Clicking the swagger or env button will open a new tab with the service's address. Clicking the Copy button will copy the service's address to the clipboard. It's that simple."
