By default, it uses a pace of 155 words per minute (wpm), but you can easily customize this rate to match your reading speed or personal preference.\n\nHow to Use:\n\n-For known word counts: Simply highlight the number, right-click, and select \"Brad's Reading Time Calculator\" from the context menu to get the estimated reading time.\n-For full texts: Highlight the script text, right-click, and choose \"Brad's Reading Time Calculator\" to discover both the total word count and the estimated reading time.\nCustomizable Settings:\n\nAdjust the words per minute (wpm) to your speaking pace directly from the extension's popup, allowing for a more accurate calculation tailored to your specific needs.\nPlease Note: Factors such as your speaking pace, the presence of acronyms, and how numbers are expressed (numerically vs. text) can affect the actual reading time. These elements might make the reading take longer than the estimated time provided by this tool.\n\nFor more insights and tips, visit https://bradhuffmanvoice.com/tools"
