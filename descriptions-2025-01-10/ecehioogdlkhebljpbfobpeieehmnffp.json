Instead of going back and forth with the AI to refine a response, receive detailed autocomplete suggestions to improve your initial prompt. This works like Google search and you also see a prompt's popularity and rating out of 5.\n\nOur search engine is crowdsourced, meaning you benefit from a rich knowledge base that improves its quality as you use it more. After selecting a prompt, choose to give a rating and feedback based on how well the LLM's response serves your needs.\n\nMake Promptly your default tool for talking to language AI. One prompt is all you need!"
