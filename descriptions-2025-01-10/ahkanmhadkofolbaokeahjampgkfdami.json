Your sourcing CRM is now integrated directly into a candidate's profile, where you spend most of your time. You can leave notes, assign candidate processes, and mark their status in a customizable pipeline.\n\nGoogle Search: \ndotLinker saves you precious time from analyzing candidates' profiles again. The interface with all insights is also visible in Google Search Results. When you type your Boolean Search query, all your notes will be visible near the link to the candidate’s profile.\n\nCandidate’s Popup: \nA comprehensive popup is integrated both in LinkedIn and Google. One click shows you the full, detailed candidate’s history.\n\nMulti-user collaboration: \nIn dotLinker, you can create workspaces and invite your colleagues to them. Every note and comment made in a workspace is available to all members. Every search can be a strategic, collaborative mission.\n\nTimestamps: \nNear every profile, you can see a timestamp informing you when you last visited the candidate’s profile. The timestamp uses your browser history; no browsing data is sent to any server."
