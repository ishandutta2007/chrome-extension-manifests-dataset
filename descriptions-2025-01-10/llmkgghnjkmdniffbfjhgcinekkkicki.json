Feel free to fork it and release a new version.\n\n\nThis is a simple extension for syncing your Toggl entries to your Jira Software Worklog.\n\nThere are two ways you can set the Jira issue ID:\n\n1. Set it up as a project in Toggl which also enables autocomplete in Toggl when registering time on the same task multiple times -  so win-win.\n\nExample:\nProject: EST-34\nDescription: Doing some work\n\n\n2. Add the Jira issue in the description. It's useful if you are using Toggl Button or maybe just like to add the issue to the description. This feature has to be enabled under settings.\n\nExample:\nDescription: EST-34: Doing some work\n\n\nTo use the extension you will need to login into Jira since it uses the cookies to authenticate your user. Do remember to fill out your Jira URL / email and Toggl API token(located at \"My Profile\" your Toggl account) in the settings pane.\n\nIf you are a developer and would like to contribute to the extension - you can have a look at the repo: https://github.com/simoneldevig/jira-toggl"
