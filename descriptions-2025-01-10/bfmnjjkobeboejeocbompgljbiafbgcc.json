You can manually install previous versions to access any old discussions, if you must (https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-discussify#installing).\n\nDiscussions are also only persisted in peers, the people who have previously seen the discussion, meaning that the discussion is only online if at least one of these peers is online. This handicap will be addressed on the MVP milestone (https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-discussify#mvp).\n\nThe codebase hasn't been audited by security specialists and it shouldn't be used to store, share or publish sensitive information."
