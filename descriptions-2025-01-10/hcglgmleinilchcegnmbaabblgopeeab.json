For example, if you're downloading a report called CrmReport.xls it gets saved to your computer as 'CrmReport.xls' with the extension of .xls'.\nThis means that your machine isn't able to open the files without a rename.\n\nThis is caused because old versions of Microsoft Dynamics do not understand how to send a valid file request response to Chrome so it saves the file as surrounded by single quotes.\n\nThis simple script identifies when files are downloaded that start and end with ' and simply removes the leading and trailing '.\n\nThere is no data stored, no data sent and no records of your usage of this extension are kept.\n\nMore details available over at https://reenhanced.com/2019/how-to-fix-dynamics-365-file-download-apostrophe-bug/\n\nProduced by Nick Hance, Software Project Rescue Specialist and President of Reenhanced.com"
