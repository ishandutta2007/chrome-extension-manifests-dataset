Done!\n• The screenshot will appear as an image on the right of the page: click on it to automatically save, drag and drop it on your computer, or right click and \"Save Image as...\".\n• To dismiss the screenshot just click on the gray area.\n\nNOTES\n—\nRemember to reload a page after you installed this extension before trying to screenshot it (Chrome needs to initialise the extension for each page).\n\nThanks to Ben Ellis and Guillermo Rauch for their contributions.\n\nREQUESTS AND BUGS\n—\nPlease notify me here: https://github.com/folletto/Blipshot/issues\n\nThere are unfortunately two annoyances that depend from Google's progress on Chrome:\n\n1 · If the page has an HORIZONTAL scrollbar the screenshot will be a bit screwed up. Make the window bigger until the next update.\nI will be able to solve the problem once Google will implement this: \nhttp://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45209\n\n2 · for huge pages it may crash Chrome when you drag'n'drop the image on your desktop (big data urls >2M aren't managed well by Chrome, an update from Google should be coming).\nThe problem will go away automatically once Google will solve this issue: \nhttp://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=69227\n\n3 • Pages taller than 32766px will be cut due to another Chrome limitation (inherited from Skia).
