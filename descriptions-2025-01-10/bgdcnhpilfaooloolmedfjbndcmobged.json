Arc loads content from people's devices running the addon instead of from slower servers, creating a faster Internet. People running the extension contribute a little bandwidth to the Arc network, allowing us to earn money and continue providing and developing this extension for free. Arc does not impact your user experience, and you can opt out by going to arc.io/optOut."
