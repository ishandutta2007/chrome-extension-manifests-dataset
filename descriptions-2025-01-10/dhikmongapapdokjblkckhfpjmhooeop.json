If you don't work for Bronto, this extension is not for you (it won't work).\n\nThis extension serves two purposes:\n\n1.  To add subordinates info to managers' faces pages.  \n\nSimilar to \"What's the Boss Chain?\", this extension injects a table near the bottom of a manager's page which lists pictures, names, and titles of all employees who report to that manager.\n\n(Infrequent faces users should ignore #2)\n\n2.  To provide an advanced faces search tool within the url bar.  \n\nAs a new employee, I use faces all the time and wanted some way that I could perform real-time searches by firstname &/or lastname &/or job title without loading faces.bronto.com.  This extension achieves that goal and also allows instant access to a LinkedIn or Twitter page by typing \"t\" or \"L\" (not case sensitive) in the url bar after selecting an entry from the drop-down suggestions.\n\n\nSee screenshots for more details.\n\nPlease email me to my Bronto address if you have any suggestions or feedback!"
