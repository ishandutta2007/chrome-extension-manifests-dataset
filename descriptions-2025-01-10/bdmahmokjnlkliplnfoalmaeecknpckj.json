Users simply need to install the extension, select the bookmarks they wish to download, and then save the file to their computer or device. The file format is XLS.\n\nSome Chrome extensions that help to download bookmark links even offer additional features, such as the ability to organize and categorize bookmarks, merge multiple bookmark files, and even backup and restore bookmarks automatically. This added functionality can greatly enhance the user experience and provide peace of mind in the event of a browser crash or other data loss.\n\nIn conclusion, a Chrome extension that helps to download bookmark links can be a valuable tool for anyone who uses the Chrome browser.
