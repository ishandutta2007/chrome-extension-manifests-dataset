So there will be no duplicate windows of the same web application.\n\nFeature 2:\nThe ANI CTI Popup Windows client opens new web browser tabs. When these are being closed, the web browser will not always activate the tab that had been active before the ANI CTI Popup Windows client had opened the new tab.\nFeature 2 is for users who prefer the previously active tab to always be activated in such a case. It makes sure this is will happen."
