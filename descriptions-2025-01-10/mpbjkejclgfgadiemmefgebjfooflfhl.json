Challenges are solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget.\n\nIt is not guaranteed that challenges are always solved, the limitations of the technology need to be considered.\n\nThe continued development of Buster is made possible thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please check out https://armin.dev/go/patreon\n\nClient app\n\nThe success rate of the extension can be improved by simulating user interactions with the help of a client app. Follow the instructions from the extension's options to download and install the client app on Windows, Linux and macOS.\n\nSolving more than a couple of reCAPTCHA challenges a day may lead to a temporary block, regardless of your use of the extension. Visit the wiki for more details.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/buster/wiki/Inaccessible-reCAPTCHA-audio-challenge\n\nMotivation\n\nreCAPTCHA challenges remain a considerable burden on the web, delaying and often blocking our access to services and information depending on our physical and cognitive abilities, our social and cultural background, and the devices or networks we connect from.\n\nThe difficulty of CAPTCHA challenges can be so out of balance, that sometimes they seem friendlier to bots than they are to humans.\n\nThe goal of this project is to improve our user experience on the web, by giving us easy access to solutions utilized by automated systems.\n\nThe extension is also available for Edge and Firefox: https://github.com/dessant/buster#readme\n\nThe developer does not collect any personal data from this extension, visit the extension's privacy policy for more information.\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/buster"
