Normally, all you can do with an Instagram™ video is play or pause it, but this extension will expose the native HTML 5 video player which has a seek bar (aka video scrubber), a volume control, a play/pause button, Picture-In-Picture (floating video) button, fullscreen video button, and on *some* videos it will also display a download button!\n\nThe extension automatically runs and works on all web pages that embed Instagram™ videos!\n\nHow to use it:\n1) Load any web page that contains an Instagram video\n2) Click the video to make it play\n3) That's it - the extension will automatically detect the video and will reveal the control buttons.\n\nOptions:\n-Control volume and playback speed via hotkey.\n-Remember your volume and playback speed for future videos.\nSee the extension config page via right-clicking the extension icon in your browser bar, then select \"Options\". Or, just navigate to chrome://extensions/\n\nDefault Hotkeys - customizable via chrome://extensions/shortcuts\nWindows / Linux:\nAlt + UpArrow: Increase Volume\nAlt + DownArrow: Decrease Volume\nCtrl + UpArrow: Increase Playback Speed\nCtrl + DownArrow: Decrease Playback Speed\n\nMac:\nAlt + UpArrow: Increase Volume\nAlt + DownArrow: Decrease Volume\nCommand + UpArrow: Increase Playback Speed\nCommand + DownArrow: Decrease Playback Speed\n\nNotes:\n- After you install the extension, make sure to reload the page for any browser tabs that were opened before installing the extension. The extension will not run in those tabs until you do so.\n- The download video button doesn't work on many videos anymore due to recent instagram changes, but it does still work on *some*.\n- On pages where instagram auto plays videos as you scroll, such as on your home page feed, make sure to play/pause the video by clicking in the center of the video, instead of using the button at the lower left. Otherwise, when scrolling, the video may not stay paused.\n\nWondering why the extension is broken so much lately?\nRead https://rehfeld.us/browser-extensions/controls-for-instagram/instagram-changes\n\nIssues currently being worked on:\n-Remember volume and playback speed not working in some cases.\n-The volume mute/buttons on the video vs the Instagram GUI aren't always in sync.\n-On stories, you must use the instagram play/pause button because the button on the video doesn't work.\n\nLegal:\nInstagram™ is a registered trademark. This extension was developed independently of Instagram, by someone who is not related or affiliated with Instagram, without any help or endorsement from them.\n\n---------\nChangelog\n---------\nFeb 5th, 2023\nV1.33 - Fix for not being able to click controls on some videos on home feed.
