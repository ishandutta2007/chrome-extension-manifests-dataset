Hit the arrow button to add a new link, or go to the page listing all links. Use ju as your omnibox shortcut to glory.\n\nYes, for frequently visited sites this isn't much of an improvement over just typing the first few letters of the site into the omnibox. Where I find this kind of shortcut really handy, though, is for URLs like \"New Google Drive document\" (or a specific doc), or deep-linking into analytics systems, dashboards, etc -- sites where there are a bunch of potential autocompletes and you can't really tell the difference at a glance."
