As it usually happens, many of these tabs are kept open just as a placeholder for review, which may not happen right away. If you cannot keep your browser open forever, or if you have multiple research projects going on at the same time, it can be convenient to just dump the current tabs on a bookmark folder, which makes it easy to resume the research activity at a later time. In fact, you can use the Open All in Tabs option on the folder to reopen all tabs."
