You MUST select a keyboard shortcut after installing !!!\n\nTo use, install the extension and then click on \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" at the bottom of the extensions page. There, select a shortcut key for \"Global New Tab Shortcut\" and be sure to change the dropdown to \"Global\" afterwards.\n\nThis extension doesn't add handlers to pages or anything fishy. It uses the built-in Chrome keyboard shortcut handling to create a new tab with the built-in Chrome APIs.\n\nSource is at https://github.com/wmertens/global-chrome-tab"
