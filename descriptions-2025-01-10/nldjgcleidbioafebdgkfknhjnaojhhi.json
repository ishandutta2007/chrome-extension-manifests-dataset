Designed as a fun and casual way to measure one's experiences and innocence, the test consists of 100 questions covering various aspects of life, from academic achievements to personal habits and social interactions. Participants check off the experiences they have had, and the final score indicates their level of purity, with higher scores representing greater innocence. While the test is often taken in a light-hearted manner, it also sparks discussions about the diverse experiences people have. It has become popular beyond Rice University, especially among college students and young adults looking to compare their experiences with peers. Website : https://ricepuritytesttool.com/"
