(Alt/Ctrl + [1-9] to switch to a specific tab by its position in the tab bar (1 for the first tab, 2 for the second, and so on, 9 for the last).\n\nThis extension provides additional keyboard based tab management by keeping a user defined history of tabs and switching among them in the order they were last accessed.\n\n## Features\nSwitch to the previous tab (e.g using `Alt+P`)  \nSwitch to the next tab (e.g. using `Alt+N`)  \nToggle between current and most recent tab (e.g. using `Alt+S`)  \nThe number of tabs in the switching history can be configured by the user (defaults to 5).  \nIf you are looking for a tab and it has fallen out of the history size then you can use another shortcut (e.g Shift your existing shortcuts) to double the size of the search history. i.e. if the configured history size is 5 then using `Alt+Shift+P` will cycle through twice as many as the default size (10 in this case). There is also a command to cycle forward through twice as many as the default size but due to a Chrome limit of a maximum of 4 preloaded shortcuts per extension you will need to set the keyboard shortcut for this yourself  (e.g. as `Alt+Shift+N`).\n\n## Configuring Shortcut Keys\nThe default keys may not be suitable for everyone, so here's how to change them:\n\nGo to the Chrome Extensions page (chrome://extensions).  \nClick on \"Keyboard shortcuts\" from the left menu.\nFind \"Tab Switcher\" in the list and click on the pencil icon next to each action to set a new shortcut key."
