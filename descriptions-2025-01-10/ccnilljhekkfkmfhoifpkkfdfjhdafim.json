This app allows users to upload an image, adjust the compression quality, and download the compressed versionâ€”all without requiring any server-side processing.\n\nFeatures\n*New Feature* Bulk Images downloader\nClient-Side Compression: All image processing is done in the browser, keeping user data private and ensuring fast processing.\nReal-Time Quality Adjustment: Adjust the compression quality with a slider to balance file size and image clarity.\nPreview of Original and Compressed Images: See both the original and compressed images side-by-side to compare quality.\nDownload Option: Download the compressed image in JPEG or PNG format, depending on the original image's format.\n\nHow to Use\nUpload an Image: Click the \"Choose File\" button and select an image from your device.\nAdjust Quality: Use the quality slider to set the compression level (lower values increase compression but may reduce quality).\nDownload Compressed Image: Click the \"Download Compressed Image\" button to save the compressed version.\n\nCompression Settings\nThe app uses a canvas element to handle image processing. You can control the compression quality with the slider:\nPNG Images: Retain transparency and do not use quality settings (saved in lossless format).\nJPEG Images: Use the quality setting to adjust compression, with values ranging from 0.1 (high compression) to 1.0 (low compression, higher quality).\n\nLimitations\nFile Size and Resolution: Very large images may cause performance issues or fail to load due to browser memory limits.\nTransparency: For images with transparency (e.g., PNGs), the app defaults to PNG format. However, converting these to JPEG will remove transparency, filling transparent areas with a white background."
