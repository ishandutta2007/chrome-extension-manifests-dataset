Password Hint  allows you to bring up the password requirement of your current website anytime by clicking the [?!] icon at the top of chrome. The user may also leave a small password hint on any website, and once saved that hint is accessible on any chrome browser that the user is logged into.\n\nNot all websites are in the database right now so if you find one please feel free to submit it to the google form: http://goo.gl/forms/YPudqMoE04\n\nThis app does not send any user data to any 3rd party servers besides Google Chrome's servers, all data stays on the users machine. Also this app IS NOT a password manager and thus is not responsible for any damages incurred if used as such.\n\nSource code here: https://github.com/drakelevy/PasswordHint"
