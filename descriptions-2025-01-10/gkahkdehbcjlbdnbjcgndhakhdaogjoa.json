Balls will approach from various angles, and your goal is to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to return them. Use the Left and Right arrow keys on your keyboard to control the paddle. Every successful hit awards points, with the amount varying based on the difficulty level. After each ball, whether you hit it or miss, a new one will appear. \n\nThe game offers three difficulty levels—easy, medium, and hard—for an engaging experience, and you can switch between them at any time. You can also pause or start a new game during any session.\n\nTo get started, simply click the game icon in the Chrome extension toolbar after installation. The game will open in a popup window and run for 30 seconds, during which your score will be displayed at the end. Your highest scores for each difficulty level will be saved and shown in the top-right corner.\n\nUse this extension to practice and improve your table tennis skills while having fun! After the practice finishes, we'll present a variety of our featured products, giving you additional fun choices to check out!"
