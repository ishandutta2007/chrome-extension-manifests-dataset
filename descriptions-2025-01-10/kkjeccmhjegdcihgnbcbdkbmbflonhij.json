Unfortunately, ChatGPT only allows you to have one version of Custom Instructions.\nThis extension is intended to solve this problem. Now you can create, store and easily access a library of your Custom Instructions using a convenient functionality side pannel.\nWith help of this extension you can:\n1. Create an unlimited number of new sections in your library, each containing \"About me\" and \"How to respond\" fields\n2. Fill these items either manually or by copying the corresponding content from Custom Instructions (\"Update library from ChatGPT\")\n3. Fill in the fields ChatGPT Custom Instructions by copying the corresponding content from your library (\"Copy CI to ChatGPT\")"
