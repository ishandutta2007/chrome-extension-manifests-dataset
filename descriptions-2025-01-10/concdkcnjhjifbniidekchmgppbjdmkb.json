Additionally, Lloyds presents radio options for\nchoosing a login method ahead of entering memorable information, the extension\ntherefore clicks any labels containing \"memorable info\" ahead of autocompletion.\n\nWarnings\n\nIf you are setting up an account for the first time, it is advisable to avoid\nthe autosubmit feature until you are confident the submission is successful,\nrepeated failed submissions are likely to lock your account.\n\nMemorable Information Rememberer stores data in your Chrome user storage\nunencrypted, it is advisable that you make sure any credentials you store are\nnot used elsewhere and that your account password is strong."
