For example, say you have tabs open as you browse Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter while you're working. You decide that you want to buckle down and get productive, so you want to close all these tabs. Now, with the press of one keyboard shortcut, these sites are closed. Or say you're looking through different destinations for a surprise trip for your significant other. No need to worry about them seeing what you're looking through to ruin the fun. Just use QuickClose, and you'll be all set.\n\nDirections:\nOnce you download the extension, go to chrome://extensions/ and click on the 'Options' link. There you will find instructions on how to set up websites you want to close. Also, you can click the 'Allow in incognito' checkbox if you wish. If you want this keyboard shortcut to work even when Chrome is not the active window, click the 'Keyboard Shortcuts' link in the bottom right hand corner and select 'Global' for the QuickClose application."
