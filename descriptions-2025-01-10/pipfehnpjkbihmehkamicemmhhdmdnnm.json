Designed specifically to overcome the limitations of Azure Workbook's built-in auto-refresh, this extension ensures your workbooks stay up-to-date, even when tabs are switched. Ideal for IT professionals, developers, and power users, it automates tab switching and intelligently refreshes Azure workbooks, providing a seamless monitoring experience.\n\nKey Features:\n\nAutomated Tab Switching: Automatically cycle through your open tabs at a customizable interval, perfect for monitoring real-time data or staying on top of multiple active sessions.\n\nAzure Workbook Auto-Refresh: Unlike Azure’s built-in auto-refresh, which often fails when combined with generic tab switchers, this extension is specifically designed to keep your workbooks updated as you switch between tabs, minimizing the risk of session timeouts and data staleness.\n\nSolution to Azure Workbook Limitations: The existing auto-refresh setting in Azure workbooks tends to stop working when the tab becomes inactive, leading to session timeouts and requiring constant human intervention. This extension addresses that issue, ensuring your Azure workbooks refresh consistently even as tabs are switched.\n\nIdle State Awareness: Smartly pauses tab switching when you’re active or when your system is locked, and resumes when idle—perfect for monitoring dashboards without interrupting your workflow.\n\nPer-Window Control: Manage tab rotation independently across different Chrome windows, with easy controls to start or stop tab rotation as needed.\n\nVisual Indicators: Quickly see the status of your tab rotation with customizable badges and dynamic icons, providing immediate feedback without cluttering your screen.\n\nWhy Choose Auto Tab Switcher & Azure Workbook Refresher?\n\nGeneric tab switchers often fail to keep Azure workbooks refreshed, leading to session timeouts and disrupted monitoring. This extension was specifically developed to solve that problem. It not only automates tab switching but also ensures that Azure workbooks refresh reliably, so you can monitor your systems without constant manual intervention."
