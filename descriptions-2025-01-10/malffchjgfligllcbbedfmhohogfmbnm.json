With Unicorn-19, replace every 'Covid' keyword with a beautiful unicorn!\n\nWhy? Why not? ðŸ¦„\n\nWith this playful initiative I hope to make you smile ðŸ™‚. Since the beginning of 2020, the information we receive on the internet has been overwhelmingly pessimistic. I hope Unicorn-19 brings some change to that and allows a more positive browsing experience.\n\nAs you will notice, some ðŸ¦„ will create some strange headline titles. Please keep in mind this is a simple cut and paste tool. My intention is not to offend or shock anyone and by no means do I want to downplay the risk of Covid-19. Don't like the extension, or had enough? You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time by clicking on the ðŸ¦„ on the top right of your screen, or by going to chrome://extensions.\n\nKeep safe ðŸ˜· and share along!\n\n\nVersion 1.4 changes:\n- Added a toggle switch to fade out content that mentions Covid to be able to focus on non-Covid news"
