Instantly show you how 50,000+ worldwide news outlets are reporting on the same story. Easily compare related articles from different publishers to verify information.\n\n2. Reveal bias and factuality ratings for news sources reporting on a story. Quickly see whether a story is receiving balanced coverage, or if it's mostly being reported on by news sources at the extremes of the political spectrum. \n\n3. Integrate with your personal social media accounts, including Facebook and Reddit, to uncover media bias hidden in your newsfeeds.\n\n4. Save articles to read later and automatically generate in-text citations to support your research. \n\n\nDeveloped by a former NASA engineer, Ground News helps readers think critically about the news they consume by providing context about the source of the information. For more in-depth analysis, we also offer a website, mobile app, and newsletters to help readers see the full story.  \n\nFor support or general inquiries, please contact feedback@ground.news"
