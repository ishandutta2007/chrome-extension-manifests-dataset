It's useful for individual as well as collaborative tasks. The Chrome plugin allows the user to connect to the Coagmento system for recording and using the browsing history. Coagmento also provides easy to use tools for collecting useful information, making annotations, and sharing resources.\n\nIn addition to information capturing and sharing, Coagmento provides a way to visualize that information (Web history, bookmarks, snippets, searches) using different interfaces that include timeline, coverflow, and 3D. Coagmento also has tools to analyze that information. For example, one could ask Coagmento to summarize and organize all that he/she did on a project last month.\n\nCoagmento is free and fun to use. So get started today at http://www.coagmento.org/"
