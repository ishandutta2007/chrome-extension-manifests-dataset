IICScan is a chrome extension that uploads your IIC Card to IPFS and generates decentralized QR codes.\n\nThis IIC decentralized tool uses the global IPFS network to enable people to share anonymous IIC cards directly with each other — Users in a local network can communicate with each other, even if the Wide Area Network is blocked for some reason. \n\nSince no servers are required, You can share your IIC Cards without any cost.\n\nSteps:\nAfter installing the extension, click on the upload file button and select the IIC CARD you want to upload. Then it'll show the generated decentralized QR code, IPFS CID, and hosted gateway link.\n\nFeatures:\n✅ Simple: With IPFS Storage, you get decentralized storage OF YOUR IIC CARD in minutes.\n✅ Open: All IIC Cards stored are accessible on the public IPFS network via a content ID - interoperable with the tools and services building on the decentralized web.\n✅ Free: IIC Cards are stored on the Filecoin network allowing us to offer IPFS Storage for free today. This storage is cryptographically provable by anyone!\n\nNote:\n* Make sure you download the QR code or save the CID before the next upload.\n* Anyone can access the files if they have your CID. So, make sure you save the CID securely for private uploading (Only Internet Identity Card (IIC) are allowed ).\n* We are NOT responsible for any harm caused by the IIC Cards you are uploading and sharing."
