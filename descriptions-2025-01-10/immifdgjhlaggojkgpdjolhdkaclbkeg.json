Users can either choose a 25 minute session or a 5 minute break. Each time a timer is picked, its respective count is updated, thus enabling viewers to see how many sessions or breaks they have had. The \"Restart Count\" button sets all of the counters back to zero. \n\nDoro is a very simple extension to use, but admittedly it does have one caveat. Although users are prevented from spamming multiple buttons when the extension popup appears, they are able to click a timer, close out of the popup, and then click on the same timer. This can result in multiple timers running at the same time. In addition, the timers do not stack, so hitting the 25 minute timer twice does not result in a 50 minute timer."
