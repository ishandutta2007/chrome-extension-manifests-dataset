Having a good day but some mac n chee sound pretty good? This extension's sole purpose is to put a little icon on Chrome that when clicked will take you to the single most important video of mac and chee ever created. It was so good that I felt a Chrome extension needed to be made to always have it one click away. Why is this extension in the Sports section you ask? Watch that video and tell me he shouldn't be competing for something.\nI am not the video's creator. Just a shepherd leading his flock."
