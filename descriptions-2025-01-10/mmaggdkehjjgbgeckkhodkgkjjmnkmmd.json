Whenever you see something you want, click the +W button, and we'll capture the item's title, image, description, and price. You can decide to override any of this information and set your wish's privacy level. The Wishfinity extension doesn't track your browsing activity and only activates upon click.\n\nWishfinity also allows you to share your WishLink via email, txt, social, or other apps, so family and friends know exactly what you want for gifting. Use your master wishlist for your birthday, Christmas, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Valentine's, or even as a registry for a wedding, new baby, housewarming, and more. \n\nNow you can save everything you want in one place without juggling separate wishlists amongst all your favorite stores. For more information, visit wishfinity.com."
