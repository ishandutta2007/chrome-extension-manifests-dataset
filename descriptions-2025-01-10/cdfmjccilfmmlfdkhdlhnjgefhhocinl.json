Clicking it bring forth a detailed information about this character pronouciation, level, as well as the words from every HSK levels where this character is used.\n\nFuture ideas:\n- Only display the words and have the details reveal by clicking / passing over.\n- Choose what characters you remember well or not and make those less/more frequent\n- Make a custom new tab page with the selected character (and more info).\n- Linking to websites for more info about the character (breakdown, dictionary...)\n- Time based change of character, probably deterministic so people see the same one\n- PDF / printable export of the character or calligraphy practice sheet\n- More ideas?"
