YoSlash is a service for creating memorable URL aliases that are securely shared with your team. YoSlash increases productivity and reclaims clarity.\n\nYoSlash links are normally served out of yo.yoslash.com. However, this domain is too long. This is where the YoSlash extension comes in. This extension rewrites any URL that begins with yo/ such that yo/ is replaced with yo.yoslash.com/.\n\nFor example, if you create the link yo.yoslash.com/onboarding, then when this extension is installed, you can access the link by typing yo/onboarding in your address bar.\n\nLearn more at our website: yoslash.com"
