Whether your focus is work or leisure, this extension can help you effectively organize your tabs beyond just one level of tab grouping and streamline your browser experience.\n\nInstructions for Use\n\n1. Highlight the tabs you want, ensuring at least one tab is within the group that you want to be the parent.\n2. Group the tabs, and a new group of the same color should appear next to it with the name group_number-parent_name. For example, 1-videos (with videos being the parent in this case).\n3. Repeat steps 1-2 to create however many subgroups and levels of subgroups you desire.\n\nFeatures:\n- You can change the name of the subgroup to help you recognize its contents. Should you do this and realize that you would prefer the original name (like 1-videos), simply type $b as the name of the group.\n- Closing the parent group deletes all the subgroups from your screen, removing clutter. When you open the parent group again, all of its subgroups will be re-opened.\n- If you re-open chrome with the same groups/tabs from your previous session, your previous tab-subgroups will be saved and still work. For example, after re-awakening your computer from sleep, your tab-subgroups will still work.\n\nCurrent Limitations:\n- The extension works best within a single window, and sub-groups created or moved outside of your main window may not function properly.\n- There are still some minor bugs when creating groups; sometimes the name of the subgroup does not initialize immediately. If this happens, opening and closing the parent group should fix it.\n\nCredits to Gemma Bardouleau for the screenshots"
