It is usually 14 days long.\n\n\nAOL Reader is a nicely designed and easy-to-use RSS aggregator. This extension is an unofficial application that periodically checks the users unread items, and shows this number in the extension icon area. \n\nAOL is using AOL OAuth to identify the user, and the extension only stores a token on the client side that allows it to access the Reader. This token can only be used for accessing Reader though, and no other AOL services. For security reasons the user is required to re-log every time when the token expires (about once in a fortnight)\n\nChangelog:\n1.0.6:\nAllowed login with external identities (Facebook, Google, etc)\nFixed a bug about the handling of folders\n\n1.0.5:\nOptions window\nFurther improvements of the flow\n\n1.0.4:\nEliminated a scenario when the token was unnecessarily fetched from the store \nImprovements of the flow and notifications\n\n1.0.2:\nFixing Manifest issue\n\n1.0.1:\nThe main flow is working, the application refreshes the count every five minutes\n\n1.0.0:\nInitial"
