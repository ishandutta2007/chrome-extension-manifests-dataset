It uses AI to help you find the best Pokemon card deals on Ebay. The tool updates itself regularly, showing new deals by looking closely at auction details and its own smart calculations. Whether it's cards that are becoming popular again or brand new finds, you'll always know about the best auctions. The extension focuses on making sure you find deals that are really worth it for serious collectors, all thanks to its smart AI technology.\n\nStay ahead in the fast-paced world of Pokemon card collecting with PokeBid Scout, your ultimate ally in securing the most sought-after cards at competitive prices. Join the community, enhance your collection, and never miss out on a deal again!\n\nThis extension showcases the top auction deals. Leveraging an advanced AI algorithm that considers numerous parameters related to auction information, it constantly updates, identifying and highlighting new deals at any moment. Given the dynamic nature of auction deals and the comprehensive nature of our scoring algorithm, items may frequently enter and exit the list based on evolving deal details and their algorithmic scores.\n\nTo ensure you're always viewing the most relevant deals, the list refreshes automatically every 5 minutes.\nUsers have the option to manually refresh if desired, but once a manual refresh is initiated, the update button will only be enabled for use every 10 seconds.\nThis feature encourages users to stay tuned and keep an eye on the updates, as our algorithm's nuanced assessment of auction attributes guarantees that you're always in the loop with the best available deals!\n\nPlease note that the developer of this extension is not responsible for the products sold on eBay, nor for the authenticity of the items. Before making any purchase, thoroughly check the product's description, images, pricing, and shipping information. The developer assumes no responsibility for the transaction, and the purchase is at the buyer's own risk.\n\nAffiliate Disclosure: PokeBid Scout uses affiliate links and participates in eBay's affiliate program. This means we may earn a commission if you make a purchase through the links provided in the extension, at no additional cost to you. This support helps us maintain and improve the extension. We are committed to transparency and ensuring our users have a great experience. All featured auctions and deals are selected based on their relevance and appeal to Pokémon card collectors, independent of potential earnings from affiliate links."
