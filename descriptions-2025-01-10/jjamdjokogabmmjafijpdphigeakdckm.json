This is normal and happens because Chrome will put extensions to sleep after a period of time to save memory and when you perform an action that wakes up the extension, the extension will take less than a second to wake up. This does not affect the performance of the extension and is an acceptable compromise because it saves your computer's memory.\n\nOpen Source: https://github.com/em-te/webextension-newTabPosition"
