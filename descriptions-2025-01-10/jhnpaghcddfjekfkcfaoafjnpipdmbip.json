Dorothy is a spaced repetition tool that learns when you should study something and then delivers it to you in a daily quiz.\n\nWe predict, to the day, when you will forget the answer to a question.\n\nWe then quiz you on that question the day before, allowing you to get the most out of the time that you do spend studying and to help you keep every answer memorized.\n\nWhether youâ€™re learning a new language, preparing for a graduate school exam, or so much more, Dorothy will help you not forget a single thing."
