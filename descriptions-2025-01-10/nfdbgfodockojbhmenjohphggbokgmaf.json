The infographic is generated when you visit either the latest results page, or any historic results page served from parkrun.org.uk.  Once generated, the infographic can be captured in a screenshot and shared on social media.\n\nFor example: if you want to see an infographic for the latest results from Portsmouth Lakeside, visit https://parkrun.org.uk/portsmouthlakeside/results/latestresults/ and the infographic will be generated and added just under the header.\n\nThe design is based on an original work by Ian Gregory at Portsmouth's Great Salterns parkrun #34 which has been adopted by many parkruns since."
