At the conclusion of each day, users would not only have the ability to view a comprehensive list of the domains they've interacted with but also gain a deeper understanding of their online habits. By categorizing and quantifying the time spent on each domain, the extension could offer visualizations or reports that highlight where the user has predominantly allocated their online time. This self-reflective tool could serve as a means for users to assess their digital productivity, encourage more mindful internet usage, and potentially discover areas where they might want to shift their focus or reduce distractions."
