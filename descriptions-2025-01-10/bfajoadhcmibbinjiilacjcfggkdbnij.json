This enables you to save money on fees by accepting payments outside of your point of sale system.\n\nIntegrate Pay offers some features to save you time and money:\n- Copies auto-detected customer name and payment amount into the destination terminal.\n- Can search for a saved customer card in the destination terminal, and auto-fill the form with the details for that saved customer.\n- Connects to USB card readers, allowing swipes to be parsed in and populate the terminal payment form automatically based on the card information.\n\nIntegrate Pay is a new extension, so please contact us if you have feature requests, point of sale systems to add, or terminals to add. We're also happy to help if you're experiencing any problems in using Integrate Pay.\n\nIntegrate Pay is a paid extension, costing $5 per month. We are pleased to offer a 30 day free trial, with no credit card required to try it. If it succeeds in saving you money, please consider subscribing."
