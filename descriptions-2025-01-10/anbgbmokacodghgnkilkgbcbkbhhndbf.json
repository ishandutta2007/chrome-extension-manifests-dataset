JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are among the input languages this extension supports. You may either browse files using the (+) button at the UI (top-left corner) or drop a file into the left textarea. Because code formatting is based on detected coding language, it's preferable to utilize the latter method since the input language can be determined automatically and the user interface will be updated accordingly (no need to modify the input language manually).\n\nWith \"Code Beautifier Online,\" you may use it offline. It makes use of an open source library called js-beauty. Furthermore, it utilizes the well-known CodeMirror (https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror) library to format input and output codes. The interface has a number of buttons in the top toolbar that are self-explanatory. There is also a list of preferences at the top with various options for the beautifier. Select any option and observe the effect straight away in the output field by changing any desired setting. To obtain a beautified result, please click the download button in the top toolbar."
