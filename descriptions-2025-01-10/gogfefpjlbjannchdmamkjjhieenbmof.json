It seemed like they were filled with popular opinions, recycled jokes, and bots promoting unrelated content. I wanted a platform where I could simply chat with people who shared my interests, without having to join yet another Discord server.\n\nThat's when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I wanted to create a space where genuine conversations could thrive, where viewers could engage in meaningful discussions about the videos they were watching. I envisioned a platform with a live online chat feature, allowing users to interact in real-time while watching YouTube videos.\n\nThe platform is designed to enhance the interactive experience of YouTube videos through live online chat. Unlike traditional comments, which often prioritize popular opinion over meaningful conversations, this platform emphasizes engaging discussions and real-time interactions among viewers. By leveraging the immediacy and dynamic nature of live chat, users can actively participate, ask questions, share opinions, and engage with both the content creator and other viewers. This fosters a more conversational and inclusive environment that encourages thoughtful exchanges and deeper engagement with the video content.\nAdditionally, the chat history is retained for three days, promoting dynamic and time-sensitive conversations."
