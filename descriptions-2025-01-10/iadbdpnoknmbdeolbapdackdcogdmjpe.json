You can still create unlimited standard aliases for free by giving out anything@username.anonaddy.com as your email address, the browser extension is not required to create these type of aliases.\n\nTo use this extension you first need to register (https://app.addy.io/register) an account with addy.io (it's free), then you can generate an API key on the settings page.\n\nIf you are self-hosting addy.io then make sure to click \"change instance\" and enter the location of your web app.\n\nPaste your API key in the extension to save it. Now you can simply open the extension and create a new alias for any site.\n\nWhy should I use addy.io?\n\nThere are a number of reasons you should consider using this service:\n\n- Protect your real email address from spam by simply deactivating/deleting aliases that receive unsolicited emails\n- Identify who has sold your data by using a different email address for every site\n- Protect your identity in the event of a data breach by making it difficult for hackers to cross-reference your accounts\n- Prevent inbox snooping by encrypting all inbound emails using GPG/OpenPGP encryption\n- Update where emails are forwarded without having to go through and change your email address for each site individually\n- Reply to forwarded emails anonymously without revealing your true email address\n\nThis addon is open-source - https://github.com/anonaddy/browser-extension\n\nBugs and Issues: Please report any issues at https://github.com/anonaddy/browser-extension/issues"
