This plugin shows a popup with aws roles you configured via a config ini file. It can be triggered via a keyboard combination, a role can then be selected via up and down arrow keys.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Edit your roles in a ./aws/config style ini format via a code editor\n* Group roles together\n* Store ~2k roles\n* Sync config via sync storage on different devices\n* Open popup via Ctrl + Shift + l\n* Navigate through roles with arrow keys, press enter to assume\n* Neat dark/light theme based on your browser settings\n\nWhy\n\nYou can store up to 5 roles in the AWS console. If you have a bunch of roles over many accounts this browser plugin might be a good choice to store your roles. It can store roughly 200 roles and syncs it with browsers on other devices.\n\nYou might also checkout aws-extend-switch-roles which is another browser plugin to switch roles. When i started to write this plugin i learned a lot of how the switching works. Originally i intended to contribute to this repository because i needed some features that aren’t implemented there. However, it’s written in a very oldschool style of Javascript, so i decided to rewrite it and give it a modern paint."
