First version supports: goo.gl\n\nThis works as an inline page injection where any URL on the page that has a goo.gl shortened URL in the href of an anchor will trigger a popup on hover.\n\nThere are clickable elements in the popup, so I kept it open until you mouse over then out of it.  It would be nice if the popup system I'm borrowing only recognizes to keep the popup alive if you move up into it.  Instead it keeps it alive even if you move away from it unless you mouse over the popup first.\n\nA touch annoying so we'll have to figure out a fix for that.\n\nPlus the popup text is ugly.  I need to work on my UI skills..."
