The app will the open all the pages in separate tabs or windows (depending on your settings). \n\nSome of the options: \n* Load URLs from file; Export links to file\n* Extract urls from text (the tool will try to find valid links in whatever text you provide)\n* Open in tabs, windows or group by host (to group your links in separate windows for each domain)\n* You can set delay (in seconds) between opening pages\n* Open part of the current list\n\nThe difference between this extension and other similar extensions is that if an URL doesn't include scheme, it will default to HTTPS. In other words, you may skip the protocol part for \"http(s)://\" sites and enter only the meaningful part. For example -- if you type \"domain.com\" it will be automatically translated to \"http://domain.com\". All similar extensions that I tested required fully qualified URL which wasn't very convenient for me and that's actually the main reason I made this tool."
