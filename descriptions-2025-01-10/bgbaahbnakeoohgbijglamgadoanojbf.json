It will allow you to present your ideas in a slick, simple design. Use markdown syntax to style your content. Write [IMG] to embed an image that you attached to your note. The first occurrence of [IMG] will be replace with the first image from your note, the second occurrence with the second image and so on.\n\nTo start a presentation use the white \"play\" button floating right above the note you're editing. Currently you will need to switch to fullscreen mode yourself when presenting.\n\nNote: this extension is still in development."
