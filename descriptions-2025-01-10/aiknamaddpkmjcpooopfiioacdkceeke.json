It usually happens whenever we are 150% focused in whatever we are doing.\n\nAs stated clearly by https://www.healthline.com, blinking is essential for your eye health. It helps your eyes stay moist and oxygenated and also clears debris from your eyes. \nNot blinking, or not blinking frequently enough could swell your cornea and that is what Blinky attempts to solve.\n\nBlinky changes your browser into an alarm. It simply reminds you to blink your eyes and keep it moist during browser usage.\n\nIt also has options which you can set to configure your alarm in anyway you see fit"
