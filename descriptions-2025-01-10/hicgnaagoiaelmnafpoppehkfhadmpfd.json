This is extremely useful for internal live support agents in contact centers or similar.\n\nNot only can you give your agents a set of decision tree scripts to follow, but each instance of the script is tied to the active page. So if you have a support ticket or case open, then launch the decision tree, and then come back to that same case or ticket, relaunching the decision tree will resume at the same place previously, and also show the history of what transpired. We call this \"Pause and Resume\".\n\nYou'll need to create your own decision tree scripts to use this extension. Sign up for a free trial at https://zingtree.com"
