Yes, that's right, all content types in the same free extension!\n\nHive's AI-generated Content Detection model allows you to quickly scan any image, video, text, or audio file on the web to determine whether or not it was made by AI. Use Hive AI Detector easily while browsing with three different ways to scan content — right-clicking it right on the webpage, pasting it into our text box, or uploading a file.\n\nThis free tool displays the likelihood that something is AI-generated. For image and video inputs, our Detector also predicts what generative engine was used to create it.\n\nOur free AI Content Detection has been praised by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and PCWorld, as well as by various artists and educators worldwide. It can be used to check for plagiarism, catch misinformation, and more — no login necessary.\n\nOur detector uses AI itself to detect AI-generated content. With machine learning, we're able to spot otherwise imperceptible differences between what's human-made and what's AI-generated, beyond style, word choice, and number of fingers. We trained our model on millions of examples of both AI-generated and human-made content, and we regularly update it to perform well on the newest versions of Midjourney, ChatGPT, etc.\n\nTo use the extension:\n\nFrom this page, click \"Add to Chrome\"\nClick on the puzzle piece icon to the right of your search bar and pin Hive AI Detector to the extensions menu\nTo scan content, either right-click it directly on a webpage or click the Hive logo to enter content via text box or file upload\nView your result!"
