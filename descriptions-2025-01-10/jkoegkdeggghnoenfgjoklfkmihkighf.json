This simple extension hides any job listing from the search results, that you've already applied to. You can also define your own keywords to hide jobs by, for example: Promoted, On-site, etc.\n\nThis light-weight extension was developed by a software developer frustrated with the job search experience on LinkedIn. The extension only activates when you're on LinkedIn, and requires no configuration or setup. Adding your own keywords to hide results with is optional. Simply install, and enjoy more useful search results on LinkedIn :)\n\nThis release was published in late 2024, if you notice anything breaking, you can open an issue here: \nhttps://github.com/Robert01101101/hide-applied-jobs-linkedin/issues"
