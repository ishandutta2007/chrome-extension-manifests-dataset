When you turn on FishBarrel, any text complained about by other users is automatically highlighted. This helps you avoid time by submitting duplicate complaints.\n\nFinally, FishBarrel can automatically revisit the websites later and check if the claims have been removed.\n\nWatch the demo (full-screen is best), then download it for free below."
