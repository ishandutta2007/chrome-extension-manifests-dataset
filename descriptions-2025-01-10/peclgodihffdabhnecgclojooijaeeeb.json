Speed up leveling.\nFeatures:\n- Craft multiple badges at once, with once click (No more click and reload 5 times)\n- Craft multiple badges from the badge list. You don't need to go into the seperate pages.\n- Purchase badge sets in groups of 5, making mass crafting even easier.\n- Always makes sure steamcommunity is HTTPS. Sometimes you'll be insecurely connected, as Steam does not force it.\n\nThis project is open source under the MIT License.
