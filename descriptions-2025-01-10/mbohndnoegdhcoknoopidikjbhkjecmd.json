Ever wondered what a bot\ngets to see online that you don't? In their latest online work,\n!Mediengruppe Bitnik allows you to become a Baidu bot to find out. \n\nThe number one search engine in China, Baidu uses web crawlers that\nextensively scrape the web for content for their search engines. Only\nwhat the bots see is indexed, for discovery later by users searching on\nBaidu. \n\nRefuse to be Human allows you to install a web extension that\nchanges your browser’s user agent to match that of the Baidu bot, giving\nyou access to what is referred to as the ‘grey web’ – a layer of content\nonly visible to bots. This simple web extension allows you to experience\nthe web in a novel way: You will see fewer ads and less taylored content\nand you will be able to access websites and archives usually paywalled.\n\n\nStep 1:\n💻 Install the web extension\n\nStep 2:\n📡 To start surfing as Baidu bot, click on the new icon in the browser toolbar\n\nStep 3:\n🏄🏾‍♀️ Surf your favourite websites\n\nStep 4:\n🌐 Check RYBN's Double Negative Captchas to see if you pass the bot test.\nhttp://rybn.org/projects/1000scores/captcha.php\n(You might have to take the test twice until it works.)\n\n\nRefuse to be Human - The Baidu edition is an art piece by !Mediengruppe Bitnik commissioned by Kunsthaus Zurich.\n\nThe source code [1] for refuse to be human is free software and published under the GNU GPLv3.\n\n<3 !Mediengruppe Bitnik\n\n[1] source code: https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/data/code/1000_bots_webextension.zip"
