This helps to bring visibility to long-running stories that \"should be done today\" for days at a time.\n\nIteration Progress - Adds a series of progress bars above the current iteration column header giving a visual indication of how far through the iteration the team is in stories and points compared to the current date.\n\nCycle Time By Point Detail Chart - Adds a chart on the Analytics -> Cycle Time that gives adds more details to the Cycle Time by Point chart. Specifically, it gives the average time a story with a given estimate spends in total, and in several key states over the given number of iterations. \n\n*Disclaimer:* Points don't equal time, and it's important that the whole team understands why. However, retrospectively it can be advantagous to look for patterns in a team's estimation. It takes a high degree of trust within the team to do this effectively, but the goal of surfacing these metrics is to drive conversations around potential behavior changes that lead to more effective development. The intent is not to pursue any metric for the sake of itself.\n\nLabel Statistics Chart - Adds a chart on the Analytics -> Cycle Time page that gives some basic statistics on the labels a user specifies. Specifically, it shows the total hours worked on cards with that label, the number of points associated with those cards (if applicable), and the total number of Feature, Chore, and Bug cards with that label.\n\nhttps://github.com/patrickelam/pivotal_extensions"
