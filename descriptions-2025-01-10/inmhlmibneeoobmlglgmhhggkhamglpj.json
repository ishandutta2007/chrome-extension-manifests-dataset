To use, find the \"Student Detail Schedule\" web page and click the extension's icon in the top right of the browser. Select the timezone that your classes are located in, and click the \"ADD\" button. It will ask you to sign into the account you want to add the events to. Once you've signed in, there will be a new calendar called \"Classes\", with all of your classes added to it! To delete all classes, simply remove the calendar from your account. To delete a select semester of classes, find that semester's Student Detail Schedule and click the \"REMOVE\" button in the extension's popup while on the web page. If there are any errors during the process of adding the classes to the calendar, they will be logged in the extension's popup window. If any unexpected errors occur, feel free to email benisadeveloper@gmail.com!"
