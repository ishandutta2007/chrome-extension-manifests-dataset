It\nsupports only the physical data modeling. Vertabelo offers SQL generation,  reverse engineering, team work support, public link to model, model versioning, and import/export in XML format.\n\nFeatures:\n \n* Physical data modeling \nVertabelo supports only the physical data modeling. The diagrams use the  (crows feet) notation.\n\n* SQL generation \n\nVertabelo generates SQL scripts that create and drop the database.\nSQL preview for the whole script or for the selected elements is available.\n\n* Team work support \n\nModels can be shared between users of Vertabelo: in read-only (viewer) mode\nor editor mode. Everyone who shares a model may open it at the same time. \nOnly one person can edit the model at a given time. When the model is opened for editing for one person, it is  read-only for others. At any time everyone who has editing rights may take control over the model and start editing. \nIt is possible to create a public link to the model. Anyone with the link can see the model in read-only mode. Publicly available models can be embedded in a website.\n\n* Model versioning \nVertabelo keeps track of all versions of database model in a linear way.\nAn old version can be previewed or restored. The paricular versions can be given a name.\n\n* Model validation \n\nVertabelo validates the database model and displays hints how to correct it in the Problem panel.  There are three problem categories: error, warning and tip. Every problem is flagged by a dedicated icon on the tree representing the model structure.\n\n*  XML import and export \nVertabelo uses the .xml file format.  The database model or its particular version can be exported to an XML file. The database model can be imported from the XMl file.\n\n*  Supported databases \nVertabelo supports the following databases:\n-    PostgreSQL 9.x\n-    SQLite 3.7.x\n-    MySQL 5.5\n-    Oracle 11g\n-    Microsoft SQL Server 2012\n-    IBM DB2 9.7"
