You can then start searching for movie quotes!\n\nCan't remember where in a movie a certain scene is, but you remember some of the movie dialog? Open up Subseek, search for the movie quote you remember and click \"Seek to Scene\" and the movie will jump to that part of the movie.\n\nWhat if the subtitles aren't lining up with the movie file dialogue? Use the subtitle selector to try another subtitle file. Subseek will remember which subtitle you choose so you won't have to search again."
