With Time is Money you will be able to know how many hours you have to work to buy that mobile or have your dreamed holidays.\n\nAnd why is it so important to know how much you have to work to buy something? Mainly because time is the most important asset we have. Time is the only thing you can’t earn or buy and it is limited."
