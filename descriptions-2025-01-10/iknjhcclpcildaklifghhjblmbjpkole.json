This plug adds a damage table to an Axies page and then totals the damage and energy used for their ability. To add ability to the damage table drag the ability card and drop it over the Axie Image. For more details of how damage is calculated please visit https://binaryassets.io/eth-dapps/axie-infinity-damage-shield-explained/\n\nUpdated for Season 20 damage balance changes and updated for skill combination changes. Critical damage calculations are displayed on hover of damage on table. There is an inconsistent rounding error between calculations and the game so this damage may be off by 1.\n\nWe do not store any information about the user and the information collected is to make sure the correct information is displayed correctly on the page."
