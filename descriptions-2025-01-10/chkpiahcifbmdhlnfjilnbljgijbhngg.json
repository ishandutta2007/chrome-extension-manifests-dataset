This means that every new window starts off with part of its window off screen.\n\nThat's extremely annoying!\n\nThere are 3 major features that make up the functionality of this extension:\n\nDisable cascading:\n------------------\nThis extension opens new windows directly to the right of the current window.\n\nRight edge protection:\n----------------------\nEven better, this extension will also protect against opening a new window with any part of its window off screen to the right. In that case, the new window will open on the left side of the screen.\n\nMulti-monitor support:\n----------------------\nNew windows always fully appear on the same monitor from the window they were spawned from. (Note: The source monitor is determined by the location of the top left corner of the last focused window.)\n\nThis keeps windows from opening with their window split across multiple monitors or having a window appear on a different monitor than the one you were originally working on (less mental context switching).\n\n\nI hope you find this as useful as I have!\n\nEnjoy!"
