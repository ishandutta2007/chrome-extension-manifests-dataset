Specifically, the tool works alongside our webapp https://cid.echoanalyticsgroup.com/ where the users are able to explore different tools to do OSNIT investigations. Once the users have selected the tools they want to use, and the search they are going to perform on each of them, our extension is in charge of opening a tab for each site and perform the search automatically, in order to reduce the amount of work that our users have to do."
