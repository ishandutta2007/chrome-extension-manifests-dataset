However, there are two main issues that hinder its usability. Firstly, there's a limit to the number of responses per conversation, which can be restrictive. Secondly, when scrolling, it often redirects to the search page, disrupting workflow. While I can't address both, this Chrome extension resolves the second issue, minimizing frustration by preventing unwanted redirections."
