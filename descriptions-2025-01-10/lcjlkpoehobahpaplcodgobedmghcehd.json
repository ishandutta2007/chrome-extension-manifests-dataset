I have never designed or developed a web dev component like this before. However, in light of recent layoffs in tech and the advent of ChatGPT and its high potential to send even more developers home, I decided to, as fast as I could, learn the programming languages necessary for web development.\n\nThis application is not perfect. In fact, I'm sure many seasoned web developers would laugh at some of the choices I've made. However, I am giving it my best try.\n\nI would love to build a team and be a landing pad for other software developers. Developers, even though remote work has been isolating, you are not alone.\n\nFor work, for play, and just for a rainy day, I hope to make the mind-blowing capability of AI to as accessible as possible.\n\nFrom one unseasoned vagabond to another, we are better together.\n\nNOTE:\nIf this product is a success, I hope to bring the entire suite of OpenAI's API to your fingertips. This includes DALE 2.0 driven image generation and Code completion. So stay tuned and invite your friends!\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nI am not responsible for the responses the OpenAI API produces or any charges incurred by your usage."
