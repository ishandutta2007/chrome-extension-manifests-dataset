By default, `Alt+M` opens the extension for redirecting the current window and `Alt+N` opens the extension for URL jumping onto a new tab. Typing `name` in the popup text box and entering will take you to `URL`. `name URL` pairs can be set in the settings page. You can also write comments along with your `name URL` pairs by using \\ (a backslash).\n\nUse cases:\n- You have an IP address URL that you want to connect to: \"dashboard http://192.168.1.136:8083\"\n- You want to use generic and short names: \"benefits https://www.manulife.ca/personal.html\"\n\nGitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/BrianWeiHaoMa/URLJumper\n\nIf you find any bugs, or think that another feature would be worth it to add, please\ndon't hesitate to open up an issue or a pull request on the GitHub repository.\n\nDevelopers: \nBrian Wei Hao Ma, Ryan B.
