It's powered by Unum ID (www.UnumID.org) so you can do so as a VERIFIED constituent and stand out from bots.\n\nUse Be Heard in 3 simple steps:\n\n𝟏. 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐜𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭. Create an account. We ask for your name, your home address (so we can find your representatives), your primary email (so they can respond to you), and your phone number (which is required by some representatives). You can use Unum ID to be a verified constituent!\n\n𝟐. 𝐆𝐨 𝐭𝐨 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤, 𝐓𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫, 𝐨𝐫 𝐚 𝐧𝐞𝐰𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞. On Facebook or Twitter, click in the post or tweet area and look for an Be Heard dropdown menu of your representatives. At the end of a news article, look for the Be Heard tool.\n\n𝟑. 𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐞! Write your message — on Facebook or Twitter, it's the text of your post or tweet — and choose one or more representatives from the dropdown list. We'll send an official message on your behalf, and the representatives can respond to you by email. If you share your message on Facebook or Twitter, we generate an image that shows you sent a message. The image is linked so that anyone who clicks it can easily try Be Heard themselves.\n\nSee www.WeShouldBeHeard.org/explainer for these instructions in greater detail.\n\nLearn more about Be Heard at our website (www.WeShouldBeHeard.org), and try our mobile app!"
