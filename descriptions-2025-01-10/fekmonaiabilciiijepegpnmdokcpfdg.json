When I make this recipe, I fry it with onions and when I do this, my whole family starts gathering in the kitchen just by its aroma. And I feel very happy to see this! Letâ€™s first know the process.\n\nMarinating\nThis is a process which is necessary for every non-veg recipe, although without marinating you can cook meat but it will lack the taste.\n\nThat is why marination is necessary in the beef Chuck roast recipe. This is done so that the spices and vegetables mix well with the meat.\n\nFor marinating, you can take the required spices and some vegetables and after lightly frying the meat, you can leave it in a closed pan for some time.\n\nMake sure the pan you are marinating in is completely sealed so that no air from outside enters the pan. This is the most important part of the beef Chuck roast recipes.\n\nThere are other methods of marinating that have been asked many times, in fact in the school where I used to learn cooking, students used to ask many questions. Because marinating is an art, the better it is, the tastier your food will be, so every process has to be understood well.\nFor making any recipe you do not have to create a boiling environment, if you submerge the meat in water then it will become boiling which will affect the taste, you have to create a steamy environment so that the taste of the food comes out well.\n\nAfter marinating, you have to prepare the oven, and preheat it to about 190 degrees. Once the oven is preheated, put the Chuck roast in a pan and wrap it well with foil paper. Make sure that no part of the meat is visible outside.\n\nIf you heat the Chuck roast directly in a high oven it will burn and the taste of the food will be ruined. This can take a lot of time so do this work carefully. After wrapping the Chuck roast in foil paper, leave it in the oven to heat for 3-4 minutes.\n\nIf in the meantime you see smoke coming out of the pan then slow down the oven, to avoid this problem you can use fat in advance which will prevent the food from burning.\n\nAfter the Chuck roast is cooked well, take it out of the oven and garnish it with vegetables on a plate. You can use different types of vegetables for garnishing like tomatoes etc.\n\nTo make the food tasty you can use Schezwan chutney and if you like sweet then you can also use Tomato ketchup.\n\nThis type of Chuck roast recipes can be enjoyed with bread. It is a protein-rich food that everyone should eat and is a great pleasure in terms of taste."
