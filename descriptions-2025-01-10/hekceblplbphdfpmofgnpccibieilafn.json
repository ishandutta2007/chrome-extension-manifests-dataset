Hopefully it will save you lots of time and stress.\n\nFree tier features:\n- Show employer name and link to their profile on each project.\n- Let you view employer reviews on employer profile.\n\nPremium tier features:\n- Hide projects from employers basing on what country they are from. Unfortunately we all know there are some countries with an ungodly amount of spam projects.\n- Hide projects basing on what tags the project has or on employer verifications or name.\n- Increase the amount of projects shown on the search page from the default of 10. This is especially useful if your other filters remove many projects and you are often left with none.\n- In addition to employer name, also view their project statistics to decide if they are likely to award the project. There are many employers who post hundreds of projects but never award, which is a waste of a bid and time. Also view the employer avatar.\n- Open the project attachments in the browser\n- Only show projects with a maximum of some bids\n- Show employer country flag on the search page.\n\nThere is a 3-day free trial for you to test the Premium features - you can access it by logging in with your Google account. If you find the features worthwhile, you can keep using them after making a one-time payment of $3.99. This will give you lifetime access to the Premium tier and possible future updates.\n\nIf you're unhappy with the purchase, you can request a full refund within 14 days. Do this by emailing contact@freelancer-helper.com Refund requests after this period will be considered at our own discretion. We do everything we can to make the extension work great. But the UI of the website changes sometimes without our control, that's why we cannot guarantee that all the features will always work.\n\n\nNeither this extension nor its author are in any way affiliated with freelancer.com"
