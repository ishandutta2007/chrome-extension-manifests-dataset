Long periods of listening time can not only affect your sleep quality, but will also damage your ears. This extension is here to help! Simply click and set a time for your Youtube or Youtube Music video to end, and relax! \n\n--------------------------------Notes ------------------------------------\n* Runs only when you are on Youtube and Youtube Music sites. \n\n* Runs on manifest v3, please update your Chrome browser to the latest version for a smoother experience.\n\n* If the video is paused, then the timer will set it on play; if the video is playing, then the timer will pause it once time is up.\n\n* There is an arbitrary amount of delay for the timer due to Google's Alarms API restriction. This is something unavoidable when developing in Chrome's mv3 ecosystem, we would appreciate your understanding in this matter and not use the sleep timer as an accurate timer. If you would like to avoid the delay, please load the extension unpacked by following instructions here: https://github.com/snoringriceball/youtube-sleep-timer\n\n* Please report any issues here -> https://github.com/snoringriceball/youtube-sleep-timer/issues\n\n* See here for a list and explanation of the permissions we collect: https://github.com/snoringriceball/youtube-sleep-timer#readme"
