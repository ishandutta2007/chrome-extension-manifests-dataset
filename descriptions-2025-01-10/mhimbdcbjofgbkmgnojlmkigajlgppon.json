Press the SENDER button on one machine, and the RECEIVER button on the other one. Enter the 6-digit token number from the sender machine to the receiver and then press the JOIN button. Once the app is ready and the connection is made, you can send files between these two peers. Please browse or drag a file to the blue circle area and wait for the file transfer to start. To cancel the file transfer, please press the orange cross-icon at any time. You can also reload the app to cancel the ongoing progress. This extension uses WebSocket and WebRTC technologies to make the initial connection and handshakes between peers. Once the initial setup is completed, a secure direct channel is established between peers, and third-party servers are not needed and used anymore.\n\nNote: this extension uses WebSocket and WebRTC servers for the initial connection and handshake operations between peers. Please read this (https://mybrowseraddon.com/privacy-policy/p2p-file-transfer.html) page to get more info.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/p2p-file-transfer.html)."
