In scenarios where data retrieval involves a WHERE clause containing a substantial number of names or IDs, potentially reaching up to 100,000 records, this extension proves invaluable. The syntax for utilizing this functionality involves constructing the query with the WHERE clause containing the extensive list of IDs or names without any length restrictions. An example query structure is as follows:\n\nSELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id IN ('HERE YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY IDs AS NEEDED WITHOUT LENGTH RESTRICTIONS')\n\nMoreover, besides handling such extensive queries, this extension is versatile enough to execute standard SOQL queries. The resultant output is conveniently provided in a spreadsheet format, ensuring ease of interpretation and analysis. As this is the initial version release, subsequent updates will focus on resolving any identified bugs and enhancing overall performance and functionality."
