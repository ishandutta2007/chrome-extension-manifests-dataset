This address is used for private networks. In all the cases, 10.0.0.1 IP Address is used for logging into the server and getting connected to a server. This address is issued by a network hardware to the client side as the default address to access various gateways. It is a special class of IP address that belongs to IPV4 and is used by huge business telecommunication brands.\n\nYou might have seen other IP addresses like 192.168.1.1 and also 192.168.0.1, both of them cater to different routers as their default gateway login.

We can take a very simple example.
