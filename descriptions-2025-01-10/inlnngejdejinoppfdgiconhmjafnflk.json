Futhuremore it's all personalized - you choose what will be banned.\nYou are worried about your likes on Facebook?\nIn the work hours section you can set time when the extension will be disabled.\nWe know the best that when you finish your work it's time to relax ;)\n\nNow when you add a new task it's automatically assigned to the website you are currently on OR you can specify the URL and the deadline yourself. The Smart Scheduler will convert your time and the website into a nice new task.\nFor example, try this:\nWrite an important email to your boss 16:30 gmail.com\n\nDefine your small measurable goals - write an email, finish a text, finally plan your long-awaited world-tour. \nGo set your tasks, a blacklist and let the magic happen!\n\nBe prepared, and finish your tasks on time - always before the deadline."
