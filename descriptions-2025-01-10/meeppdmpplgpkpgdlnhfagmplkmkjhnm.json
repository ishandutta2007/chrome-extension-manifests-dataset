Domains with usergenerated content (as github.com or youtube.com) are not included.\n\nIs this censoring? \n- No, this is a way of limiting domains with a high amount of noise. \n\nWill it hide a really interesting story?\n- Yes, but any story that is number 1 will never be filtered (so if it's really good, you will still see it)\n\nHow can I see if anything is being filtered?\nThe sequence of numbers at the left side will skip the order of natural numbers.\n\nI really want to see what is being filtered?\nOpen the page in incognito mode to avoid filtering anything. \n\nCan I alter the list of domains being filtered?\n- Not right now, but that is where I want to go with this plugin.
