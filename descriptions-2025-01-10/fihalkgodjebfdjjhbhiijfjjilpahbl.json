Stating your stance and rights as a member of the human race, to all spying and intercepting eyes. The declaration starts at 11m 27s into the video.\n\n                  ● —   ※  — ● \n\n“This is to certify that the bearer is a member of the human race. \n\nAll relevant information is to be found in their passport. \n\nAnd except when there is good reason to suspect him of some crime, he will refuse to submit to police interrogation and the grounds that any such interrogation is an intolerable nuisance and, life being as short as it is, a waste of time.\n\nAny infringement on his privacy or interference with his liberty. Any assault however petty against his dignity as a human being, will be rigorously prosecuted by the ISPIAO.\n\nThe International Association for the Protection of the Individual Against Officialdom.”\n\n                  ● —   ※  — ● \n\nBackground:\n\nIn a 1955 BBC programme, Orson Welles was filmed doodling in his sketchbook and talking (apparently extemporaneously) about whatever struck his fancy. The program was called, straightforwardly enough, Sketchbook. \n\nIn one episode, Welles speaks about his experiences with the police and with customs officials as he travels (which he did a lot). He finds the growing power of the cops to be officious and dangerous. His words are perfectly applicable today.\n\n\n\"I’m willing to admit that the policeman has a difficult job, a very hard job, but it’s the essence of our society that the policeman’s job should be hard. He’s there to protect, protect the free citizen, not to chase criminals, that’s an incidental part of his job. The free citizen is always more of a nuisance to the policeman that the criminal. He knows what to do about the criminal…. I’m not an anarchist, I don’t want to overthrow the rule of law, on the contrary, I want to bring the policeman to law.\""
