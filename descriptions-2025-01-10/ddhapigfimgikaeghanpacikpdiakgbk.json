This extension may now be used to extract a video list for any topic, a video specification, and customer comments for a single video.\n\nIn contrast to prior YouTube scrapers, our plugin extracts more than simply captions, likes, comments, and shares.\n\n- We retrieve nearly all of the page's data, including Video ID, MP4 Download, Video Title, Video description, Video PublishedAt, Video Channel Title, Video URL, Video Channel Url, Video Thumbnail URL, Video Channel ID, Video Views, Video likes, Video dislikes, Video Comments count, Channel subscriber Count, Total Channel Views count, Channel Published at, Channel Author Image, region Code, Captions\n\n- It works with all YouTube's  URLs.\n\n- Bulk URL allows you to add up to 100 channel/video URLs, single video URLs, or both, separated by commas, and export data to an excel file.\n\n- The scraper automatically grabs article data when you click the Start Extraction button.\n\n- Click the restart button to resume extraction from that product if the extension shuts for any reason throughout the procedure.\n\nHow to use:\n\n1. Go to www.youtube.com\n2. Type any keywords you want in the search bar, such as a Channel name, Video likes, Video dislikes, Video Comments count, and so on.\n3. Use the filtering option and then press enter to fine-tune the search results.\n4. Launch the chrome extension and click the start button after the search results have appeared. The information will be saved in an excel spreadsheet.\n\n\nWhat you get out of this product is:\n\n- Competitor analysis: Export the entire video list in excel format, including the channel name, video likes, dislikes, and comments count, for additional study.\n- Market research: Find out how clients react to different video viewing times.\n- Restart functionality: If the scrapper closes in the middle of a job, you can resume scraping data from the article.\n- Bulk URL: A comma-separated list of post URLs from which data can be collected is required for the bulk URL.\n\nYou'll be able to retrieve the following information:\n- Video ID\n- MP4 Download\n- Video Title\n- Video description\n- Video Published At\n- Video Channel Title\n- Video URL\n- Video Channel Url\n- Video Thumbnail URL\n- Video Channel ID\n- Video Views\n- Video likes\n- Video dislikes\n- Video Comments count\n- Channel subscriber Count\n- Total channel views count\n- Channel published at\n- Channel Author image\n- Region Code\n- Captions\n\nWhat types of posts are supported:\n- All of the categories\n\nHow many numbers does the data support: There is no limit.\n\nSupported sites: www.youtube.com\n\nException: \n- This suggests retrieving no more than 1000 data points at a time.\n- Depending on the volume of data, the extension may hang or require an unusually long loading time.\n\nTechnical assistance:\nAny suggestions or ideas for improving the items are welcome.
