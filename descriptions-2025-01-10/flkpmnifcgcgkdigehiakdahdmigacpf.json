For more info, see https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-classroom-tweaks/ajidehkdcfndgeeejbnfeikngkidcdfm?hl=en&authuser=0\n\nNB - I will not be posting any more updates to this extension.  All new work will go into my Google Classroom Tweaks extension.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis extension provides a simple(r) way to provide feedback within your Google Classroom Gradebook.  You can define course/assessment specific comment banks and then  quickly paste feedback into the Private Comments field in your Google Gradebook (or pasted whereever you need to enter your comments).\n\nThe Google Gradebook Comment Bank (GGCB) dialog will appear when you open an assignment for grading (i.e., when the https://classroom.google.com/... URL contains `/tg/` or `/submissions/` ).  \n\nWithin the GGCB dialog, you can add your own named classes and for each of those classes you can define as many different comment banks as you need.  This allows you create lists of comments targeted towards specific assessments - e.g., progress reports, homework checks, tests &/or quizzes, larger essays or assignments, etc., etc.\n\nTo enter the comments, click the edit button and simply type them into the textarea (one comment per line) or paste them from another source.  You can include blank lines to allow for spacing  within your feedback.\n\nOnce you're happy with your comments, click the save button and they will be converted to a list of checkboxes.  Whenever you check or uncheck a comment, the selected comments are automatcially copied to the clipboard.  The erase button at the top of the checkboxes quickly allows you to clear the selections.  \n\nIn my current use case, I select the comments I want for a child and then paste the text into the Private Comments field in Google Classroom.  I can foresee pasting the comments into messages to parents, guardians, guidance, etc., etc.\n\nUPDATES:  \nV1.0.1 - some minor UI tweaks (2022.03.14)\nv1.0.2 - removed the mature content rating... no idea how that got in there in first place\n\nISSUES:  the GGCB dialog does not always appear correct ATM if there are no attachments turned in with the assignment (I've noticed it most when the URL includes `/submissions/` rather than `/tg/`)... The simple fix for this issue is to reload the page. (I am working on a fix for this bug).\n\nPRIVACY - this extension does not track, share or communicate *any* information whatsoever.  All of your classname and associated comment banks are saved automatically on the computer where they were entered (and not shared anywhere else)"
