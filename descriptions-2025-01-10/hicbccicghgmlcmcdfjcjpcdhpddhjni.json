The extension also enables you to export the summary to the note-taking apps you like, (currently support org-mode export, more to come).\n\nThe extension is particularly useful for those who need to read and process a lot of information quickly, such as students, researchers, or professionals. With our browser extension, you can streamline your research process, save time, and retain information more efficiently."
