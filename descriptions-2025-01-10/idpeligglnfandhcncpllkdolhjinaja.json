Net transfers in the form of red/green arrows\nIn the \"transfers\" page, red/green arrows are used to show the net-transfers for the player during the current gameweek. Green arrow indicates more transfers in while red arrow indicates more transfers out. More arrows indicate more buying/selling activity. Hover over the arrows to see the exact net-transfers number. \n\n5. Profit/loss made on players in the user's team\nIn the \"transfers\" page, the extension shows the profit/loss made on the players in the user's team.
