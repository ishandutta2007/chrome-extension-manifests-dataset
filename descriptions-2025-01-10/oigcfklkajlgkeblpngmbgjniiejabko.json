Save time by uploading images in bulk; the extension will automatically pair fronts and backs based on the filenames. MPC Project Helper then creates a json-formatted project file with links to the already uploaded images. This allows you to quickly combine multiple projects for cheaper printing and to share the project file with others, saving them the time of re-uploading and keeping your original project intact. No longer will you have to re-upload a project to make changes, or find that someone with whom you shared a link to your design inadvertently changed the project for everyone."
