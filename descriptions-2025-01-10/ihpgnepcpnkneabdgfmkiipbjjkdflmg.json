Each user can contribute his/her network capacity as well as own local storage (e.g., indexedDB) in their browser while reading the page, and a larger organization might even contribute to the community by deploying own servers (no out-of-pocket money!), similar to a mirroring server in an old good day (e.g. GNU FTP Mirrors <http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.en.html>).\n\nThis extension will have two modes of operation, togglable with just one click on the extension icon.\nIn the \"redirect\" mode, the extension will automatically redirect all your accesses to the en.wikipedia.org domain to our B2B version, located at http://b2bwiki.cc.gatech.edu/. However, we also provide a fail-safe mechanism so if the redirection is not successful, we will still connect you back to the original wikipedia site.\nThe extension will have no effect when it is toggled to the \"normal\" mode.\n\nIn either modes, the extension will have no effect on your browsing to any other websites besides the en.wikipedia.org domain, nor will it record your browsing history or any information in any circumstances."
