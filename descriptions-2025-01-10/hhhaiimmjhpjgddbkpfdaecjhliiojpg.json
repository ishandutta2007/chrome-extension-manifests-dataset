An access key consists of an access key ID (something like AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (something like wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). Anyone who has your access key has the same level of access to your AWS resources that you do.\n\nBots crawl all over Github seeking secret keys left by any team members in their code. The keys can then be used to launch massive numbers of AWS Virtual Servers etc. in your AWS account that can lead to financial loss.\n\nWith RepoSecure you can scan your Public Repo to check whether access keys are accidentally published and secure your AWS account now!\n\nUse RepoSecure to sign in to your GitHub account and automatically scan the repositories absolutely and stay secure.\n\nRepoSecure is brought you by cloudmantra free of cost as our Good Karma.  \n\nBy installing the extension, you agree to RepoSecureâ€™s Terms & Conditions (https://www.cloudmantra.net/legal-notices/)."
