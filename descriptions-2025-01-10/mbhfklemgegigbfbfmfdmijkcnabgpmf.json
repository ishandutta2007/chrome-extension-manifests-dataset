The first method is to unregister service workers whenever they are registered. The second method completely nullifies the service worker, so websites cannot initiate the service worker in the first place. The second method is rather aggressive and not recommended as some websites may encounter errors. There is also an option in the popup toolbar to delete the cache (window.caches). This addon has a whitelist feature to exclude certain domains. You can add a domain via the toolbar popup or from the right-click context menu within the page. If you want to turn off the addon, please open the toolbar popup and then click on the toggle button at the top left corner.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/no-service-worker.html)."
