This makes building and testing email based functionality much easier as you can see emails as they're sent and check their content/design without leaving your application.\n\nTo get started, sign up for free at https://imitate.email (it only takes an email address or social login) and you'll get your free mailbox with SMTP credentials or address.\n\nThen start sending emails from your application to that mailbox (either using our SMTP server or using your mailbox email address) and they'll appear inside your application.\n\nDon't waste time setting up a local fake SMTP server, or dumping emails to the file system. Imitate Email also provides IMAP/POP3 interfaces alongside Web Socket support for fast integration testing. And, when you're ready for users to test out your application, you can easily surface test emails to your users.\n\nFor more information, please see https://imitate.email\nTo see it in action: https://imitate.email/demo"
