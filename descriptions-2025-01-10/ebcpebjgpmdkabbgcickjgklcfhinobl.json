Some geek work is required, but it's faster than working with the original log.\n\n1. Log into your Foreflight account and navigate to Flights and display your NavLog.\n2. Right-Click in the NavLog and choose \"View Frame Source\"\n3. In the browser address bar, delete this text from the beginning of the URL: \"view-source:\" and hit Return. Now the NavLog fills the page.\n4. Click the Format NavLog Icon, then the Format NavLog Button.\n5. The NavLog should now be reformatted with only the following columns:\n    Waypoint\n    HDG\n    LEG (distance)\n    LEG (time)\n    ETE\n    ACT (blank)\n6. Now copy/paste the NavLog to Google Sheets or Excel and tweak it how you like it."
