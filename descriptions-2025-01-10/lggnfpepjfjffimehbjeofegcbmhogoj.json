But, it only works if you actually enable it!!\n\n2FA Notifier lets you know which sites you visit support 2FA and specifically how to enable it.\n\nAnytime you visit a site that supports 2FA, you will get a notification that let's you know. Clicking on the notification will bring you directly to the site's documentation explaining how to enable 2FA. The right information, right when you need it!\n\nBetter protect your accounts from hackers by installing 2FA Notifier and enabling 2FA everywhere you can!\n\n-----\nWe would really appreciate the opportunity to address any issues or bugs before you leave a poor rating. Unfortunately, we cannot reply to comments left on ratings, so it is difficult to understand the issue and fix it. We are very responsive to all issues filed on GitHub: https://github.com/conorgil/2fa-notifier/issues. Thanks!"
