This allows you to:\n\nHave our extension automatically try and find contact information from a webpage you are viewing or from a text selection and return to you a contact form that you can then import into Crelate.  The information that is imported can also be used to generate a PDF resume for the Contact.  If the parser finds a suitable profile picture on the page, it will attempt to import that as well!\n\nWhen viewing a page that can be identified as an existing contact in the system, update the contact with the information available on the page.\n\n\n3.2.0\n\n- Updates to support the new Contact Enrichment feature.
