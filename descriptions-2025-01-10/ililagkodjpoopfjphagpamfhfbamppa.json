This avoids the annoying situation when you use a website blocker only to find that the useful information you're googling can be found only on Reddit.\n\nFeatures:\n- Works on both new and old Reddit\n- You can enable only the features you want\n- Hide front page\n- Hide r/all and r/popular\n- Hide browse page of all subreddits\n- Hide various distractors like \"More posts from r/some community\" or \"Discussions in r/some\"\n\nThis addon is open source. The repository is hosted at https://github.com/jaksim/less-distracting-reddit. Suggestions and code contributions are welcome."
