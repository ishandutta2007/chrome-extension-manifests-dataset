It helps create a more comfortable visual experience, reducing eye strain and improving productivity.\n\n> Key Features:\n\n- Automatic Theme Application: \n  The extension seamlessly applies a dark theme as soon as you access the SAP CPI environment, offering a smooth, eye-friendly experience with minimal setup required.\n\n- Customizable Themes:\n  Choose from a variety of themes, including 'Morning Horizon', 'Evening Horizon', and 'Quartz Light', to suit your preferences or time of day. (Availability depends on system support.)\n\n- One-Click Accessibility: \n  Easily switch between themes with a single click on the extension icon, making it accessible and user-friendly.\n\n- Cloud Platform Integration:\n  You can easily switch back to the default SAP theme when needed. The extension also streamlines your experience by automatically closing the navigation bar on startup.\n\n- Privacy and Transparency:  \n  As an open-source tool, the extension respects user privacy by not collecting any personal data. Users can also inspect the source code and monitor network activity for complete transparency.\n\n\n> Get Involved & Support\n\nIf you encounter issues or have suggestions, feel free to contact us via GitHub or email. The project is open for contributions, so if you'd like to get involved, please visit the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/incpi/Dark-CPI-Web-Extension).\n\nThank you for using the Dark SAP CPI Web Extension"
