It makes the Internet equal again, no matter where you are. It allows you to easily access any website and enjoy absolute browsing freedom in full privacy. \n\nTuxlerVPN offers amazing features like:\n\n✔ A Huge Number of Locations Available\n\nOur network is community-powered and our reach is ever-growing. The more users use our solution, the bigger our network reach and anonymity. \n\n✔ Precise City Level Selection\n\nSometimes the country-level selection is just not enough. Choose your location precisely on the city level and surf the Web like a local user.\n\n✔ Residential or Data Center servers\n\nResidential servers provide full privacy, and a huge choice of locations from many different ISPs but their speed is slower than Data Center servers.\n\nData Center servers are easy to detect and don't provide as much privacy as residential servers, their choice of locations is limited but the speeds are better than on Residential servers.\n\nMost other VPNs offer you only Data Center server option. We offer you both. With tuxlerVPN you can use Residential or Data Center servers depending on your current needs. \n\n✔ The Only Plugin Offering Full Browsing Anonymity\n\nTuxlerVPN is community-powered and thanks to that you are fully anonymous when using Residential servers. Unlike regular data center VPN providers, tuxlerVPN doesn't leave any patterns and it's impossible to determine that you are using a VPN. \n\nThanks to this feature you can browse the Web as a real user without worrying that you may be detected and that your privacy may be compromised.\n\n✔ Equal Web Access To Everyone\n\nFinally, a peer-to-peer VPN solution that offers full anonymity and allows you to access any website by combining the resources of all our community members. \n\n✔ No Bandwidth Limits.

Whenever you connect to our service you can be sure that your identity is protected. We don't serve any ads.\n\n✔ Encrypted Connections\n\nAll connections are encrypted and anonymous so you can be sure that all your browsing is secure. It comes in handy especially for travel when you need to secure your public Wi-Fi connection.\n\n✔ One-click Activation, No Configuration Needed\n\nAll you have to do to join our community network is to install our software and click on the \"Connect\" button. From that moment your privacy is fully protected and your connections are encrypted.\n\n✔ Fresh And Constantly Renewed Servers \n\nAren't you tired of VPNs with the same old servers that are blocked everywhere? Our service's strength is in its great community. When you join our community you will be able to use the best quality, undetectable VPN service.\n\nThis extension requires either the tuxlerVPN Application or a previously activated Premium Account to work. \n\nAfter installing the extension you will be given a choice of a Premium Account login or Application installation. The Application is located on our secure server and easily installs with just a few clicks. \n\nAfter installation of the Application you will be able to use our Freemium version which allows you to use our services with only two limitations:\nSpeed limitation\nDaily location changes limitation\nBandwidth and usage time are unlimited!\n\nIf you have any technical issues, suggestions or you just want to get in touch with us, please write to us at support@tuxlervpn.com.
