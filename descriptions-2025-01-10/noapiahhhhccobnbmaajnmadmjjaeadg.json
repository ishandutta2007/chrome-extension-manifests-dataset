It truly boggles the mind.\n\nThis extension fixes that.\n\nOnce the page finishes loading (which may take forever because it's ConnectWise), just move your mouse anywhere on the page and it will set the name of the tab as the Ticket number and Ticket title.\n\nAlso if this extension is going to save you as much time as it is going to save me, I promise the time you get back will be well worth the money you spent on this extension.\n\nWhich is free right now (get in while you can!)."
