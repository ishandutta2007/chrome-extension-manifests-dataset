It does the following:\n\n* Encourages you to choose shipping options with a low carbon footprint.\n* Rates and labels products and their brands by how green 3rd party sources say they are. We also identify health risks.\n* Tells you what data sources are behind the rating, and allows you to look at this detailed information directly. We also tell you the credibility of the rating.\n* Sorts Amazon search results by our ratings\n* Encourages no-rush shipping\n\nWe rate FASHION, COSMETICS, ELECTRONICS, and FOOD ITEMS. (Categories in progress: Automotive)\n\n**Disclaimer: we try to be transparent since we can't be hundred percent accurate all the time. But we still believe that this can genuinely lower your footprint; if you'd like to know more about why - email us!**"
