So far to manage time, we keep using notepad. This option was not suitable for us, because it took a lot of time and sometimes could be forgotten. In response to this Tempo Time Tracker has been created!\n\n★ Authorization free\nThe extension is 100% secure and does not require any Jira account credentials.\n\n★ Browse worklogs\nExtension scans the current tempo page and takes a currently browsed week’s worklogs. The worklogs are presented as easy to access list. Normally, the native tempo app hides descriptions of tickets by default, but don’t worry - Jira Tempo Tracker provides all the important information about worklogs.\n\n★ Continue tracking existing worklogs\nEach currently logged worklog could be continued by clicking the play button. There is a built-in restriction that only one worklog could be tracked. If you will try to track two worklogs at the same time, the first one current progress will be stopped and synchronized with Tempo, then the second item will start counting.\n\n★ Create new worklogs\nYou can just start tracking a new worklog from scratch. Description and issue could be provided at any time. But both of them will be required while synchronizing with Tempo.\n\n★ Log a provided amount of time proportionally\nIdeal option to log your lunch or other kinds of break proportionally to each task of selected day. Just select the day and amount of minutes and the script will execute an update to each worklog. Each value is measured by comparing worklog time to summary day time logged so far.\n\n★ Use in any tab\nThe extension could be activated in any chrome tab. Just make sure that the native Tempo app is opened in one of the tabs. In another case, you will be notified that the Tempo app has not been found. \n\nIn case of questions, suggestions, or bugs please let us know :)\n\nChangelog 31.05.2022\nAdd compability with more jira instances\n\nChangelog 30.06.2021\nImprove finding Tempo tab\nImprove browsing and picking issues\n\nChangelog 26.06.2021\nFix bug with logging proportionally and denying playing item collapse\n\nChangelog 01.06.2021\nFix bug with not logging proportionally after popup close\nFix bug with invalid time sync while saving worklog and popup close\nFix bug with invalid time when start tracking\nAdd error tracking"
