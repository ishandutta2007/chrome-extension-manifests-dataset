Previously, finding these IDs involved either adding custom code to your course or using the browser inspector to manually search for them—both time-consuming and cumbersome.\n\nCreated by the team at ReviewMyElearning.com, this Chrome Extension allows you to instantly view all [data-model-id]s on the slide with a single click. Simply click on any element to automatically copy its ID to your clipboard—no more digging through code or relying on alt text workarounds.\n\nOur goal is to help developers create better eLearning courses faster and with fewer headaches.
