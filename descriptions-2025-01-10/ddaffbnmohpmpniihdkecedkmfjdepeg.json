It is intended to replace the names of classmates in discussions with their preferred names. It can also be used to annotate classmate's names with pronouns.\n\nSetup\nAfter installing the extension from the Chrome store it needs to be configured. This can be done through the extension options which can be accessed through chrome://extensions or edge://extensions depending on your browser.\n\nLEO AKA Options allow classes to be added with different students and different preferred names per class. To add a class, click the ADD CLASS button in the options page. Give the class a name that helps you remember which class it's referring to (e.g., WRTG 293). Each class requires an ID that matches the number from the URL for that class. For example, if the class home page is https://learn.umgc.edu/d2l/home/35, then the ID would be 35.\n\nFor every student whose name should be updated with a preferred name, click ADD RECORD. Enter the full student's name in the Name column and what to replace it with in the Preferred column. Click on the 'Save' icon in the row that has been added to commit it.\n\nAfter adding all the student name records click the blue SAVE button at the bottom of the options page.\n\nClasses that have ended or are no longer needed can be removed via the DELETE button on the class page."
