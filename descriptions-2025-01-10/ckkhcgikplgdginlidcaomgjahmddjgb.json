Despite this fact, it has some characteristics that break some privacy assurances.\n\nOne of them is an official method for a website to detect you are running brave.\n\nThis method involves two custom properties on the navigator object, accessible at `window.navigator.brave`.\n\nThis extension will delete `window.navigator.brave` and make it impossible to detect if you are running Brave browser.\n\nChange Log at: https://github.com/andrei0x309/Brave-Detection-Blocker-Chrome-Extension/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\n\nTo increase the effectiveness of this extension, please make sure you have also turned both Solana brave wallet and Ethereum brave wallet from your browser settings, as they both leave fingerprints like 'window.solanaBrave'. ( there's a screenshot of the settings page for disabling the wallet in the repo)\n\nPlease use a wallet that doesn't leave fingerprints, such as what browser you are using.\n\nI wrote one open-source implementation of EVM wallet here that does ZERO tracking. Check it out here https://github.com/andrei0x309/clear-wallet.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://github.com/andrei0x309/Brave-Detection-Blocker-Chrome-Extension/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md\n\nGit Repo: https://https://github.com/andrei0x309/Brave-Detection-Blocker-Chrome-Extension"
