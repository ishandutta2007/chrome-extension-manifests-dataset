You will be redirected to CardMarket. \n\nIf you want to check other pages, put the text and click on \"Find on Store\". \n\nIf you want to search for a gachalog deck, just put the code in the text box and press enter or click on the button. \nYou can also access to the main page of gachalog from that button if you put anything that isn't a gachalog code on the text box. \n\nFinally, the FowSys redirects you to your FoWSystem account page.\n\nYou can find it on my github:\nhttps://github.com/AbsydeAuberon/FoW-ChromeExtension\n\nAlso check my social networks:\nhttps://twitter.com/alvarotl_\n\n\nChangelog 0.0.0.4:\n-Added a FoWDB button for searches on the database.\n-Now it checks where country you are based on your language set on Chrome and redirects you to your correct FoWSystem page.\n-Now if you are an American/Canadian player, you can search directly the card writing the name and pressing ENTER. It will redirect you to TCGPlayer (as I know, the biggest market in USA).\n\nChangelog 0.0.0.3:\n-Search was completely broken, so I fixed it again.\n\nChangelog 0.0.0.2:\n-Fixed an error for Gachalog search. If gacha code started on 0, it searched for mkm instead. Now it works fine.\n\n\n\n[Disclaimer] This extension is a modification of austin0crutchfield's extension in order to adapt it to Force Of Will. You can check his extension for MTG in his github https://github.com/austin0crutchfield/MTG-Quick-Search"
