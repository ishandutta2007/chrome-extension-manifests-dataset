You can use this application to attach to Spice servers anywhere, right from your browser! \n\nNeed to access Spice instances behind a firewall? Use a dynamic SOCKS proxy over SSH to encrypt and tunnel your connection. This app is built to use your proxy settings in Chrome. \n\nThe majority of this code is maintained by the developers at www.spice-space.org. Please consider donating for their work.\n\nVersion 1.1.6+ includes new features and small bug fixes.\n\nInstructions:\n* You need a spice remote desktop server setup: http://www.spice-space.org/download.html\n* Setup websockify to translate into websockets: https://github.com/kanaka/websockify\n* Connect Spice Remote desktop app by typing the IP and port of the WebSockets proxy, as well as the configured password of the server if there is one."
