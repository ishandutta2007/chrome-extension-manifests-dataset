Sometimes you may be fed up with 'ctrl+f' to find these key words or you can't remember them at all when you wanna review.\nWith Capsule, you just mark and comment anywhere in a webpage until you delete them manually. When you need review what you have marked, just open the capsure to find the marker and click your left mouse and the page will scroll to where your put it.\nCapsule can remember the markers you have put until the source of the web is changed or too much markers have been stored.\nEvery long webpage needs a Capsule."
