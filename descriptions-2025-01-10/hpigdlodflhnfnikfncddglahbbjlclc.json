You are ready to organize your job search.\n\nWhy ManageJobApplications?\nIt has happened to all of us: an unexpected phone call comes in regarding one of your job applications. Quick - what do you remember about this one application out of the dozens (or hundreds) that you've submitted? Which resume did you send? Did you include a cover letter? With this free system, everything you need to know is just a click away.\n\nTrack Your Progress\n\nNothing keeps you motivated like seeing the progress of each of your applications. The Dashboard puts everything in context, with complete access to all of the underlying information, too. Prioritize your time and don't let anything fall through the cracks.\n\nVisualize Relationships\n\nWhich recruiter called about that job? Recruiters, job postings, hiring managers; with all this information swirling around it is easy to miss the inter-relationships that could put you one step ahead of the other candidates. With all of your job search data linked, these connections are right in front of you, ready for your next move.\n\nExpand Your Network\n\nIt is well known that your professional network is the shortest path to a great new job. Expanding your network is important, but takes a lot of time and careful record-keeping. Keeping track of all those relationships is much easier with this system because connections between people, jobs, and activities are available at the click of a button.\n\nHelpful Tools\n\nDon't miss the ever-growing collection of tools to make your search more productive and save you time. Import your spreadsheet of job postings, highlight keywords in job descriptions for better cover letters, or just archive those applications that get ghosted. These tools have one goal in mind: saving you time that can be better spent landing that job!\n\nHow much does this cost?\n\nIt is absolutely free! There is no charge to use the system, no subscription cost either. In fact no credit card is requested at all. You don't even need to register an email address if you wish, although one is required if you ever need to use the password recovery feature. If you are looking for a new job, the last thing you need is another bill to pay!"
