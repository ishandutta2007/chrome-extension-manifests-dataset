Extension users are individually recruited and voluntarily opt in to share their web browsing activity to aid in research endeavors. \n\nThe extension collects browsing activity on search engines for the duration of the survey task. The information collected include their unique, anonymized user ID, unique URL visit, the HTML of the search engine webpage, and timestamp of each visit. \n\nThe user voluntarily installs the extension to give data to researchers at CSMaP. They can delete the extension to halt data collection at any time without penalty. They are also given instructions for revoking access to their data at any time.\n\nThe collected data is securely stored and accessible only to the CSMaP researcher and the participating users who can procure it or access its usage if desired. The CSMaP team is dedicated to ensure security, transparency, and integrity of the data provided and its use."
