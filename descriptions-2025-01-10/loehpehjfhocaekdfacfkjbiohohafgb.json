ChromeGoose provides a unified framework for leveraging the power of all these components by connecting them through well-define data-types. These data types include NameList, Matrix, Tuple and Network that were defined previously by the Gaggle framework. Various desktop analysis packages, web resources and custom scripts are easily plugged into ChromeGoose architecture and all data incompatibility issues are avoided.\n\nCurrent implementation of the ChromeGoose integrates connectivity between Chrome,  Cytoscape, MeV and R. In addition based on the OpenCPU package, any R scripts can be plugged into this framework with minimal effort. We have already implemented three R scripts for custom analysis of regulatory network models including data plotting, filtering and performing enrichment analysis. \n\nChromeGoose is developed by the Baliga Lab at Institute for Systems Biology."
