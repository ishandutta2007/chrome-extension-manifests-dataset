Despite all your best efforts to be productive, you just can't stop yourself from scrolling. If only there was a fun app to break you out of this habit...\n\nThat's where SideQuest comes in! Periodically, SideQuest will give you a short, fun miniquest, ranging anywhere from winning a Connect 4 game to collecting pieces in chess, that exercise your brain and break you out of your scrolling. Better yet: these quests are required, so you can't just close out of them - they'll reopen!\n\nQuests will also give you points, which you can spend on \"skips\" to allow you to skip quests, in case they pop up when you're doing something important, and rolls for cute cats! You can also click on the icon to play any minigame you want any time you want.\n\nWe wish you the best of luck, and have fun with your sidequests!"
