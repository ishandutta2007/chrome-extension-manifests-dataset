There are also some other settings that you may want to change: you can choose which eBay site to open (.com, .co.uk etc.), you can set the button to open eBay in new tab or in the current tab and, if you want, you can add it to the context menu.\n\n**Questions & Answers**\n\nWhy adding separate extension for something that needs only a bookmark?\n-- Because bookmarks can’t be added to the toolbar, and there are changeable icons (and some other options) for better look and feel\n\nBut extensions eat system memory, why wasting resources just for one simple bookmark?\n-- Not true. It doesn’t eat memory. Said in programmers’ slang: it uses non-persistent background page, which, in English, means the browser does not reserve memory for the button (check the Chrome Task Manager if you want to see for yourself: when you click on the bookmark icon it will start the extension, open the settings page and remove it quickly after that). It acts like bookmark and the only resources it uses is for the screen space of the icon (yes, it takes space from the toolbar, because… well, that’s the whole point of it)\n\nIf I install it, is it easy to remove the extension later?\n-- Yes, you can remove it with literally two clicks (just right-click on the eBay button and select “Remove from Chrome”)\n\nHow to access the options page?\n-- Right-click on the button and select “Options”. \n\nHow to set it to open eBay in the current tab instead of creating new tab?\n-- Right-click on the extension’s icon and select “Options”, then uncheck the first checkbox\n\nHow to add the shortcut to the context menu?\n-- Go to the options page (see above) and check the “Add button to context menu” checkbox\n\nHow to change the toolbar icon?\n-- See above: just go to the “Options” page and play with the icons. Note that if you select your own icon, it has to be 19x19 pixels (otherwise you’ll get strange results)\n\n\nDisclaimer:  This extension is not an official eBay product.
