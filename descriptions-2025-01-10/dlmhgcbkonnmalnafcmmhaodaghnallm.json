But make sure that you don't want to click on the blue underlined link title. Just click on the list item white space if you want to navigate to the link. But if you want to create a new link with the same URL, then do click the link.\n\nAttributions: Icons are made by Pixel perfect and Freepik from flaticon.com\n\nPatch 1.0.1:\n- Minor bug fixes\n- Default title changed"
