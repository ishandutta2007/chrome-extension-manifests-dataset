Turned off by default.\n- Provides a Twitter-like interface for you to search tweets you’ve seen.\n- Search results are displayed exactly as seen on Twitter. There is a “compact” mode option that reduces the size of the media elements so more focus is placed on text.\n- All you need is an OpenAI key. You can generate embeddings via either the text-3-embedding-large or text-3-embedding-small. The cost is negligable, but there is a cost estimator inside the extension should you be curious about pricing (around 150k tweets per $ for the large model)\n- Small amount of customization options, like the similarity score threshold for a tweet to appear in your search results.\n\nGot an idea to improve this extension?
