Stay tuned!\n\nThis extension allows users to search for available testing dates in an easy and efficient manner. It is currently targeted towards the USMLE Step 1, Step 2 CK, and COMLEX exams. Users can select any location and dates to search for the testing sites currently available on those dates. The extension runs locally on your browser, opening a new tab to search for availability and will close upon completing the search. A badge notification will appear next to the extension icon notifying when the search is complete, as well as a chrome notification.
