This was a Google Mail app (in labs). Unfortunately removed some days ago. So I remade it for us. Any advice and comments are welcome! \n\nSupport me with 5 stars! :)\n\nUPDATE 13/10/12: New version arrived! Major bugs fixed. Enjoy!\n\nNeed more help? Click! http://mousegestures.blog.hu/\n\np.s. If it's not working at first, don't give up! Try clearing your cache (Use CTRL+SHIFT+R hotkeys!) and restarting Chrome. That should do the trick. \n\nUsage: Press right mouse button then:\n - drag up: go to inbox*\n - drag left: newer mail** \n - drag right: older mail**\n\n* I know, this action should go to previous list, unfortunately it's impossible because annoying Chrome bug. :(\n** Works only when you are reading a mail (watching a single list soon), because chrome bug. Sorry for that\n\nFind me on twitter: @kisPocok"
