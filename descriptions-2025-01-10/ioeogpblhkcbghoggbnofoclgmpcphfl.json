The Chrome extension plugs in to your browser's \"inspect element\" feature, to display the source code and line number of the element's Wicket component.  And Source-Opener plugs into either Eclipse or Intellij.  \n\nIn combination, these three parts provide round-trip quick service to jump between rendered web pages and the code that created them.\n\nThis plugin is only useful for Wicket applications with the wicket-source module installed and configured.\n\nMore information is available through the github page:  https://github.com/jennybrown8/wicket-source/wiki"
