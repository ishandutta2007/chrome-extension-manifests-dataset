This extension was designed to change all instances of his name in web pages (such as Facebook) to French Fries in order to keep things in perspective. I updated it to allow you to change your own word or phases as necessary to help keep your own web browsing in perspective. You can add as many words or phrases to replace as you like. The replacements will take place in order listed.\n\nIf you like this plugin and have a few extra bucks laying around, please donate to your local animal shelter or pet rescue organization."
