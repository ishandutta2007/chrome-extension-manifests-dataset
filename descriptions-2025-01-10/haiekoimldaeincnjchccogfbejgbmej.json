It stops once it finds what you need and sends you a Chrome notification—keeping things simple and efficient, without unnecessary extras.\n\nLatest Version: 1.3\n\nYou can now monitor for words that disappear from the page on refresh!\nFixed notification bugs.\nRemoved the sound file (it wasn’t playing anyway due to browser security settings).\n\nPrevious Versions:\n\n1.2 – Interval value now saved between sessions (you’ll need to run at least one auto-refresh to save it). Added a 'randomness' toggle to randomize the refresh interval by up to 10%. Start/Stop Refresher is now a single toggleable button.\n1.1 – Updated with alert, dark mode, background refresh.\n1.0 – Initial release.\n\nThis is an open-source project.
