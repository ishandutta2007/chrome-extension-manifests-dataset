And it works all offline.\nYou can list the paths Javascript libraries and it will load them and display them as well. It uses the for (in) statement to reflect on types so that it will work on any library. It also will display the contents of non-native functions in its summary panel.\n\nYou can also load JSON from files or from pasting it into the box. You can then edit the values of strings and numbers and then copy the object's JSON out again.\n\nBecause it includes permissions for all aspects of a Chrome web app. You can navigate through the Chrome Extension APIs and use the Javascript console to test them out.\n\nIf anyone knows of/has/would like to make an XML format of Javascript library documentation. I would be happy to implement them into the app to make it even more useful.\n\nYou can save the app's page to create an outside the app copy that can be used in other browsers. (I have only tested in on Firefox)\n\nSee the blog post to learn more about how to use it\nhttp://duck-producktions.blogspot.com/2014/06/javascript-object-browser-update-120.html"
