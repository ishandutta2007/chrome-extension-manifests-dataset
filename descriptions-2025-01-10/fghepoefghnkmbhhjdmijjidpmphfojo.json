Anger tech support scammers by making them think you've purchased gift cards but wasted it all.\n\nNOTE: This extension will prevent the ability to redeem Google Play cards, and prevent you from seeing your Google Play balance (otherwise it would show as $0). Never allow scammers into your actual PC, and never enter enter actual payment information into a scambaiting VM. This extension should never be used in the same environment where you would be redeeming gift cards."
