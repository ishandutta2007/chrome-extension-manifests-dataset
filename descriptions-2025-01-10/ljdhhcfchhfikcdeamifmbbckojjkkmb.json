Find the tab where the item can (!) be located, and there are dozens of them.\n2. From dozens of elements, choose the one you need, but you still need to find it.\n2.1. And if you need to buy fossils or essences, but you donâ€™t know what they are called, then you have to google by property to get the name.\n2.2. Or you have to peer into pixels to find the item you need.\n3. Even knowing the name, property and photo of the item, we still have to search! There is no sorting on the site.\n\nEach attempt to buy something turns into a detective horror, where the main character will be tormented until he reaches his goal.\n\nThe extension solves this problem in a very nice way. We take the structure of the chest from the game and throw it into the browser.\n\nAs players, we always know where to find the item we are looking for in the chest. \nTherefore, the extension emulates the structure of the chest in the game, so that any player can buy the necessary items for himself in 3 clicks instead of hundreds of others.\nIs it buff?"
