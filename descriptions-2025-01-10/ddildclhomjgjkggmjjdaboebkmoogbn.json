A significant portion of useful content across the internet is hidden behind a wall of insubstantial and frivolous content. Our extension can help users circumvent this stubborn wall.\n\n The extension incorporates summarization, translation and preemptive searching capabilities to provide a gist(short summary or disclaimers) of websites, youtube videos, playlists, foreign videos and websites and can check for explicit content in websites. Users can refer the summary and instantly access the crux of the topic regardless of linguistic differences.\n\nFor instance: a 200 page research paper or a 3 hour youtube video can be condensed into a short paragraph enlisting all the important topics discussed.\n\nThe logo is a visual representation of the many salient features of the extension, thus sigma symbolizes summarizing of several languages from articles to videos. \n\nImproved general convenience while browsing the internet:\n-> Enabling access of content across language barriers.\n->Provides disclaimers for potential explicit content in websites.\n->Helps users avoid misleading and click-bait content.\n->Upto 40 supported languages.\n->Supports 2 types of summarization techniques- Abstractive and Extractive Summarization (Extractive and abstractive summarization to meet the requirements of scholars and casual web surfers alike)."
