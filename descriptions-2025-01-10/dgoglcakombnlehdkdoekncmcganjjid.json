If so, this extension is perfect for you! Set your own custom prompts and simply highlight the text you need, right-click, and select \"Ask ChatGPT\" â€” it's that easy!\n\nThis extension adds a context menu (right-click) option to 'Ask ChatGPT' which sends your selected text to a ChatGPT chat window, formatting the prompt based on user-configurable options.\n\nTo use the GPT 4 model, enter a ChatID for a GPT4 chat in the extension options. This also ensures that the same chat is used every time, making the extension more reliable as it helps avoid \"one message at a time\" errors. \n\nTo get a ChatID, exchange a few messages with ChatGPT; you'll find the ID in the URL (e.g., chat.openai.com/chat/<ChatID>). \n\nFeedback is welcome, please feel free to leave a review with any suggestions or bug reports. Yes I am aware that this is terribly written :3\n\nPlanned additions in order of how much I can be bothered to add them (most to least):\n- Multiple Context menu options\n- Option to change inner text of context menu button\n- Toggle to open a ChatGPT iFrame that persists in the background, instead of a New Tab\n- Plugin functionality (I'm waiting for beta access)"
