It aims to subconsciously implement the idea of inclusive language, and allow companies to mould an environment where everyone is accepted.\n\nFunctionalities:\n- context menu / right click menu. Highlight text, right click, and select equill to rewrite text\n- if the equill panel is active, it will listen on all \"textarea\" elements (note that it must not be a fancy custom editor) and send the text to the rewrite AI\n- supports txt and pdf file uploads\n- supports highlighting text without right click\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThis chrome extension uses the Cohere AI api, however we are not associated with the company nor are we sponsored by them. You need your own API key to use this extension (costs nothing!)\nThe data is sent to Cohere, which is a well-known AI platform.\n\nContext:\nNon-inclusive workplaces cost U.S. companies over $1 trillion (https://chief.com/articles/non-inclusive-workplaces-cost-us-companies-1-trillion-heres-how-to-change-that). To solve this problem, we created Equill, a chrome extension that analyzes documents to create inclusive and culturally appropriate language."
