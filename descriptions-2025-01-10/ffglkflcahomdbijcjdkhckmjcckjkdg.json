Go to any Japanese language website and highlight text that you don't know and would like to learn, then click the icon to activate the plugin. All the words you've highlighted will be translated and put into an Anki deck containing the kanji, kana and definition (based on the EDICT dictionary file).\n\nRight now, the app is in BETA, so some definitions might be off. The code is open source can be found at: https://github.com/Munksey/anki-jiten. Any contributions/suggestions are welcome."
