It allows you to inspect the element hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools, and provides you with suggestions on how to select them, while encouraging good testing practices.\n\nYou will get two new tabs in your Chrome DevTools: \"üê∏ Testing Playground\" as a tab, and as a side panel under the \"Elements\" tab.\n\nBy selecting one of the elements on the page, you can inspect the different queries that can be used to select the element in your tests, and get feedback that tells you when and why there are better queries available.\n\nIf you inspect an element on the page using the regular Elements tab, then switch over to the Testing Playground tab, that element will be automatically selected."
