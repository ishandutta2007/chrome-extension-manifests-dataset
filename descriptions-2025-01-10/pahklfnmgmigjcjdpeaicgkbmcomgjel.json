By clicking on the extension icon, you can also input a custom range of dates to give you the data you are looking for.\n\nWhy is this useful?\nWhen you are looking to make pickups, drops, or just want to compare your team with your opponent, knowing the amount of games left for each player is crucial.\n\nWhat are \"off-nights\"?\nOff-Nights are games that occur on days in which less than half of the league is playing.  Having more off-nights helps you to maximize the amount of starts you can get in a week.\n\n*Update 1.1.0*\nAdded support for ESPN leagues.  This feature hasn't been thoroughly tested yet.  If you run into problems, please just reset the page to reload the data.\n\n*Update 1.1.4*\nMajor bug fixes and added ability to change colour of icons."
