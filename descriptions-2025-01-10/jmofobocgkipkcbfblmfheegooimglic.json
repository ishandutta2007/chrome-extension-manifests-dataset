Simple.\n\nFor anyone wanting to customize the behavior, both the search phrases and the wordlists are modifiable as options.\n\nThe included wordlist provides close to 1 million possible combinations so each time a page is loaded you're likely the first person to see that specific phrase.\n\nThis extension is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible.\nNo tracking. No data sent to server. No glut. No ads. No cookies. Always open source.\n\nWe need your help in growing this extension. The wordlist will be updated over time based on real users submitting new word options so please submit new options by following the steps at the <a href=\"https://github.com/loftyotter/trmpt\">project's homepage</a>."
