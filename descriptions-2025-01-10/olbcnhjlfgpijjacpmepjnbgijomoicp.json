The extension makes it even quicker, more reliable & predictable. \n\n‚≠êÔ∏è How it works\n\n1. Set the shortcut and the link it should open (like \"e\" = example.com);\n2. Type the shortcut into the browser search bar and hit ‚ÜµEnter;\n3. Instead of your search engine page, the extension opens the page you defined.\n\n‚úÖ Extension RUNS LOCALLY on your device. No data/request is ever sent or received.\n\nNote: to achieve a natural feel, and due to technical limitations, the search results page actually opens. Then the extension reads your search request. If it matches one of the shortcuts, the page gets immediately replaced with the set page. This is why the extension requests access to your search engine page.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Supported\n\nüîó Link types: http, https, ftp, local files (works only in some browsers).\n\nüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Search engines: Most popular ones (we are not allowed to list them here)\n\nüíª Browsers: Chromium browsers, FF and Safari\n\nüí° Usage ideas/examples\n\n1. Get straight to the needed page (avoid home, welcome, and other pages on your way to your everyday content).\nExample: Open your project management application boards bypassing the home page\n2. Open the same pages with different accounts.\nExample: Google uses different URLs to open different accounts for Gmail, Calendar & other products. You can set 'g1' to open your personal Gmail and 'g2' - for the work one.\n3. Open your company page without typing the exact URL.\nExample: Usually, organizations have multiple pages on their domain. SaaS companies can additionally have app subdomains. Because of this, when you type http://company.com/ or http://app.company.com/, many suggestions appear, which do not always match what you need. Set 'app' for your SaaS app page, 'ccom' for the company home page. It makes entering the page quick and reliable, just type the shortcut and you're guaranteed to open that exact page.\n\nüëÄ Additional suggestions\n\n1. To avoid coincidence with your real search requests use short text for your shortcuts that is unlikely to ever become the word you search for.\n2. You may use special characters at the beginning of the shortcuts to make it even less likely to be your search request. For example, you can use a dash '-ccom'."
