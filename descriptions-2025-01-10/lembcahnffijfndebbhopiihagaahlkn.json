This extension enables non-IATA agents to remotely issue tickets, simplifying the process and expanding the capabilities of agencies.\n\nTicker grants the Consolidator the rights to issue tickets and handles the entire ticket issuance process on behalf of the Consolidator. After that, the ticket is returned to the agent for further use or distribution to clients.\n\nKey benefits of Ticker:\n\n• Remote ticket issuance for agents without IATA accreditation.\n• Intuitive interface requiring no special training.\n• Full control for the Consolidator over the ticket issuance process.\n• Increased efficiency and expanded capabilities for ticket sales agents.\n\nTicker helps improve interaction between agents and Consolidators, providing a faster and more convenient ticket issuance process."
