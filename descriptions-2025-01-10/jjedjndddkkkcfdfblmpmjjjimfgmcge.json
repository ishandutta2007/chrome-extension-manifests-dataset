Offering a unique blend of strategy and reflexes, Dots Pong challenges players to outmaneuver their opponents in a fast-paced, neon-lit showdown.\n\nIn Dots Pong, players control a paddle on either side of the screen, tasked with bouncing a colorful dot back and forth between them. However, unlike traditional Pong, the dot changes color with each bounce, and players must strategically match it with the corresponding colored zone on their paddle to earn points. The pace quickens with each successful match, keeping players on their toes as they strive to keep the dot in play and outsmart their opponent."
