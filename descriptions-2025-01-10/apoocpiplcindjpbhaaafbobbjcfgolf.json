We made you a Demo Video!:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8IIheVMCCI\n\nForgetbook doesn't save any of your information.  It works entirely inside of your chrome browser, clicking the buttons on your activity log the same way that you do.  We don't even have an external server!  If you'd like to see the code for youself, check it out on github: https://github.com/forgetbookapp/forgetbook  \n\nWe hope forgetbook saves you a lot of time.
