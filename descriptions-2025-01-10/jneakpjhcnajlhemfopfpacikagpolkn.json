Simply go to the \"Grades\" tab on GOLD and select \"All Quarters.\" A calculator will appear at the bottom of the page next to your current quarter. \n\nGradeMyGold correctly calculates your GPA, even if you are retaking a course. If you would like to omit a course grade, set its corresponding drop down to \"P/NP\" and it will be excluded from the calculation.\n\nAll calculations are performed locally on your machine. Your data is not altered and nothing is reported to me."
