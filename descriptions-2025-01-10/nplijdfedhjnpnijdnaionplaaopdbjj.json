As well as provides you with much more comfortable tools than default ones for viewing any opened image.\n\nYou could have seen the way images are opened by default with lacking of some essential tools and not being able to switch between images inside a folder. That is why you may need 'TabIt - Images' to alter that.\n\nSuitable for:\n  - Raster images up to the size [16384Ã—16384] (268 Mpx) - due to the browser's limitations\n  - Vector images of the SVG format\n  - File extensions: JPEG, JPG, PNG, BMP, ICO, GIF, SVG\n  - URI-schemes: http, https, file, blob, data\n\nIMPORTANT: In order to operate with local files any extension would need you to go to chrome://extensions and check the box that says \"Allow access to file URLs\" next to according extension. And so does this.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n***** WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT *****\n+ Saving rotated image\n+ Saving to other file extensions + Lowering image quality\n+ FullScreen + SlideShow\n+ Better smoothness by animation\n+ Light theme\n+ Other prettification :)\n+ Your suggestions?\n\n***** DECLARED PERMISSIONS ***** UPDATES *****\nPlease, see detailed information about this extension here:  https://alexperience.me/projects/tabit/tabit-images"
