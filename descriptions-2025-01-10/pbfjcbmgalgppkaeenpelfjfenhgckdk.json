After you set up a mapping of keywords to table names you can use this extension to create SQL commands based on certain command letters. So if there is a table called CUSTOMER_MEMBERSHIP and it's key is CME, you can type SCME hit tab and it will automatically create a select statement from the CUSTOMER_MEMBERSHIP table.\n\nThere are 9 command keys as of this version, they are S, J, W, K, I, F, L,T, and C. Entering any of these letters before a valid table key will create a SQL statement.\n\nS = Select * from {Table Name}\nJ = Join {Table Name} on\nW = Select * from {Table Name} where\nK = Select * from {Table Name} where {Key Column Name} = {key that you have copied to your clipboard}\nI = Select * from {Table Name} where {Key Column Name} in ({list of keys that you have copied to your clipboard})\nF = Select * from {Table Name} where rownum <= 10\nL = Left join {Table Name} on\n\nT and C are different than the other commands in that they do not require a table key and they will prompt you for input, all that is needed to trigger this is to to T or C and hit tab. They will ask for either or table name or column name to search for and it will return tables or columns that match your search term.\n\nThe options page for this extension allows you to define the mapping of table names and table keys as well as override the f5 key to prevent it from refreshing your browser and instead it will run SQL commands within the SQL commands page in Oracle APEX."
