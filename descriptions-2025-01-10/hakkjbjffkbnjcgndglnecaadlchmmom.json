The addon will remain available for download as long as the store allows, and the source on gitlab (https://gitlab.com/Marnes-group/webextensions) will also remain available to fork.\n**I do have a greasyfork account (https://greasyfork.org/en/users/18593-marnes) and may publish works there in the future.** I have mild intentions to reimplement the core functionality of CSL, IBCP, and DID as public userscripts.\n\nAlso available for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/page-dark/\n\nPage Dark covers the webpage with a black screen when you click the toolbar button or trigger the hotkey. Everything except media like videos or games, frames and Flash objects will be hidden by it. This allows you to watch online videos, play Flash games, etc in a much more enjoyable way.\n\nPlease check the linked homepage for more complete information. Issues can be filed on the linked support site."
