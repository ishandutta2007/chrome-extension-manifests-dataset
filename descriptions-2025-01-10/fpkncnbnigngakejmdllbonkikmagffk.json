VHS does not have regular working hours, so the space is only open to members when a Keyholder is present. The extension queries isvhsopen.com to see if a Keyholder has opened the space, and for how long it will remain opened.\n\nWhen the space is open, the closing time is shown in an icon at the top of the window. When the space opens or closes, a popup notification appears with the new information. Closing time is continuously colour-coded based on how much time is remaining:\n(Green)  open for > 5h\n(Yellow) closing in 1h\n(Red)      closing in 1min"
