It combines the left speaker's content below 3kHz with the right speaker's and vice versa, making the bass sound mono.\n\nMonoBass works on both video and audio elements on pages that support this feature. The extension is activated by clicking the left mouse button on its icon. For a full sound reset, it is recommended to reload the page.\n\nKnown issues:\n-    On some pages, it is not possible to affect audio of the played elements. This is due to how the specific page is designed.\n-    On some pages, when clicking on the extension button, the browser may mute the sound. This is due to the security configuration of the specific page or the server it is hosted on and unfortunately cannot be detected from the extension's point of view.\n\nIf you find this extension useful, you may consider supporting the author with a donation of any amount. Check the menu by right-clicking the extension button."
