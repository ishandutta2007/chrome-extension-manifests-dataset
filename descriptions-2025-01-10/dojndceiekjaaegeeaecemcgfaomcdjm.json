Once a theme is available in the catalog, you can search for it, tag it, pin it and open any associated link in the browser or on your mobile device via a QR code link. \n\nWhy you should give it a try:\n- easy access to all themes including the temporary ones, created with shopify CLI;\n- themes from multiple shops in one place;\n- QR codes to quickly open themes on your mobile;\n- pin or tag themes for a quick access;\n- search themes by name, url or tag;\n- the catalog is being automatically updated whenever you access shop's back office.\n\nShopify Assistant is absolutely free, it does not show ads, does not collect or send user's data anywhere. It is an open-source project and you are more then welcome to give your feedback or share your ideas on how to improve it: https://github.com/md604/shopify-assistant\n\nRecent updates:\nv0.2.1\n- (bugfix) show a valid theme's state on tab change.\nv0.2.0\n- (feature) add infinite scroll that helps the popup to load faster;\n- (feature) add storage tests;\n- (feature) show theme's counter in the tab menu;\n- (feature) add dummy themes generator for testing needs."
