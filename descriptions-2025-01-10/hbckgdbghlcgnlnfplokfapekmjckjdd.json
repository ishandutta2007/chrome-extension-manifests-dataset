With an intuitive UI, users can upload a photo, determine how many rows and columns they want to split the image into, and then download the segmented images seamlessly. The preview feature also ensures that you're aware of how the final segments will look before the split. Enhance your image processing workflow with Midjourney Image Splitter."
