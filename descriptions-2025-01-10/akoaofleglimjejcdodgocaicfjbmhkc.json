But it can get super-busy: too many bookmarks, and losing track of what we've bookmarked.\n\nBookee was designed to access and search through your bookmarks instantly: just press the \"Command + Shift + k\" shortcut, and Bookee will pop right up.\n\nStart typing to instantly search through your bookmarks, and then press the Enter key to open that bookmark in a new tab.\n\nHere's what Bookee will *not* do:\n- 🚫 It will *not* share your data with any third party sites\n- 🚫 It will *not* export your bookmarks to any servers\n- 🚫 It will *not* be a closed system. We will be open sourcing it soon 🙂"
