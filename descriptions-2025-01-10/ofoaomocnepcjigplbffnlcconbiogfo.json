All it does is inject a little bit of CSS to improve the Behavior rules layout.\n\nChangelog\n 21 July 2020\n- Added the ability to select text in the app. For some reason it's disabled by default by ThriveCart. However, I sometimes need to copy a customer name or some other informationâ€”this will solve that."
