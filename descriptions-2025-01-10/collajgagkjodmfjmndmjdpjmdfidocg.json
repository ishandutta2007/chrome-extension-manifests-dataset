If you think the message you receive is spam, just report it.\n\nIf several people have reported it, it will appear as reported, so you will know that this message has been sent to hundreds of people.\n\nThe icons are only available on those people who wrote to you first, and only on their first messages.\n\nClaim a clean network, where, if they want to sell you something, they don't treat you like a flyer in a mailbox.\n\nIt works even with similar messages, even if you change the name, or the company name, or some phrase (which is what mass mailing bots allow you to do), Wham detects similar messages when someone reports them."
