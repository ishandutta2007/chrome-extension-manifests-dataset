Unfortunately it can be cumbersome to unlock a scholar article since you would have to go through the University's library website. Using this extension you can easily redirect to the unlocked version of the scholar article with one click, without having to leave the article that you want to read.\n\nFor example, this locked article:\n    https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03048-z\nwould be redirected to the unlocked version in one click:\n    https://www-nature-com.ejournals.um.edu.mt/articles/s41586-020-03048-z\n\nThe default university access page is set to the University of Malta. This extension works with other universities - to do so, change the URL redirection to an EZproxy URL in the options.\n\nThis extension works with several scholar websites, including (but not limited to): IEEE Xplore, Nature.com, ProQuest, ACM Digital Library and SpringerLink.\n\nThis extension provides a very lightweight addition to the browser, while improving significantly the researching experience.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nIcons made by smalllikeart from www.flaticon.com.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis extension was developed independently and is not affiliated with University of Malta or other entities mentioned above."
