On any page that you visit to click the purple WordFish to FISH for words and definitions from that page (right click any of those terms to bing for a definition). Then when 4 words+Definitions are found click PLAY, and then click a [word] then it's [definition] to match up words with their definition. Hopefully you can Score:4/4!! When the game is over you can right-click a [definition] to open the wikipedia page where it was found, or click elsewhere on the screen and continue browsing. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special:random"
