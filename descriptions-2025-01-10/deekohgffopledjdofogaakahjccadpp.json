Are you tired of looking for games on Steam just so you have to scroll by hundreds of obscure games with 20 or zero reviews? This extension mouse-hovers over every game in the search result list, so the web page downloads meta-data for every game, then it looks for the review count and compares it to your setting. When a game is too obscure for you, it hides it.\n\nPermissions required:\n- Read and change you data on store.steampowered.com\n\nIn store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deekohgffopledjdofogaakahjccadpp\n\n\nOpen source at https://gitlab.com/phpmoli/filter-games/\n\n\n![screenshot](https://gitlab.com/phpmoli/filter-games/raw/main/screenshot.png)"
