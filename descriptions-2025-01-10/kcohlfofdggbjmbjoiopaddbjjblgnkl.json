Design Mode is a tiny extension which puts Chrome into edit mode, allowing you to edit entire pages as though you were in an HTML editor.\n\nThis extension is great for quickly testing concepts, such as whether a page layout breaks when a heading hits a certain text length, or whether an image or button would look better on the other side of the page.\n\n★ Move images by dragging them around.\n★ Edit existing text by clicking and typing.\n★ Add new text before or after existing elements.\n★ Change font style using standard keys (ctrl+b for bold, etc)\n\nThis extension is not designed as a hardcore development tool and is limited by Chrome's implementation of design mode. Changes are temporary; reloading the page will clear any changes.\n\nTips:\n☛ You can make a single HTML element editable by adding the \"contenteditable\" attribute.\n☛ You can activate design mode by hand by opening up the development console (F12) and typing: document.designMode = 'on';\n\nOf course, that's more work and you don't get the nice icon telling you which tabs are in design mode. You need a cool extension for that, right? ;-)"
