Two websites and integrations have been developed by the community to implement a game ranking system for the players (a ladder). One of the sites is hosted at http://oraladder.net, this website lists the most recently played games for each player, along with their rating on a scoreboard. There's also a separate but similar site, http://ragl.org, which hosts a similar website which is dedicated to the Red Alert Global League (RAGL) competition.\n\nSeparately to the above, I have written a parser to extract replay statistics from replay files https://github.com/AMHOL/openra-ruby, and another developer has written a web front-end to visualise that data https://dragunoff.github.io/OpenRA-replay-analytics/.\n\nThis plugin adds links next to the replay download buttons on http://oraladder.net/latest and http://ragl.org/games, as well as on player profiles, to display the game statistics in the replay analyser, for example, a link to https://dragunoff.github.io/OpenRA-replay-analytics/#/oraladder/52fe5b1871f82a2885ba2df789cdbc1b2c18e4dea86f0df89b88180f1139e64b"
