You can also compile the code and view the final document in the app (side or bottom sections depending on window size). After you've compiled a markdown program, click Print to print it as a PDF (via print UI). Please note that this software is based on CodeMirror (codemirror.net) and markdown-it (github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) open source JavaScript libraries.\n\nThere are only a few options to change for this program, simply open any markdown document, modify the code on the left side editor, then alter the top toolbar settings and then compile. Please keep in mind that while you type in the editor, the add-on compiles the code on-the-fly as well. You can also save the final markdown code or generate a PDF of the completed work."
