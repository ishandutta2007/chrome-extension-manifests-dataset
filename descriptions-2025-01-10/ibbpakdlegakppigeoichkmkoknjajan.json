This provides a quick way to make email alias\naddresses with flexibility of the generated alias while not being tied down to any specific platform or service.\n\nThe goal of this was to address the lack of feature filled extensions for catch all email alias generation like the \nones for services such as Simplelogin.io or Addy.io. While there are \nmany services that support catch all email address most if not any provide a means of easily creating / generating them.\nI wanted something similar in ease of use equal to how password managers generate passwords but with even more flexible options.\n\n- *IMPORTANT* Tab Permission required for using current url / domain in generated alias.\n\nFeatures:\n- Flexible settings to change how alias is generated / what is enabled\n- Random character / word generation\n- Get current website url\n- Custom groups with auto fill\n- Save generated aliases\n- Dark / Light mode"
