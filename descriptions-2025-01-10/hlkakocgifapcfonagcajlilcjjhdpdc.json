I use it everyday in my work. Sistrix is an outstanding SEO tool. It has many different functions and options. But the most important one: it makes the web comparable. In the meanwhile in 30 countries.\n\nDisclaimer: this extension works only for Sistrix clients!\n\nIt checks on-the-fly Sistrix mobile visibility of every domain you are on. (Yes, i was thinking about which metric should i take, and maybe desktop, or maybe both. But, finally i decided to take only the mobile visibility, because Google will never come back to \"desktop first\" paradigm).\n\nBeside of mobile visibility, it prepares for you direct links to Sistrix main metric pages, like domain, host, path (until three path steps, if applies). Links are placed in the popup opening after click on the icon in the extension bar.\n\n*How it works*\n\nNext after installation you see a welcome screen, where you should select your preferred country. This setting will be used for querying of visibility and maintaining direct links to the metric pages.\n\nThe country setting you are able to change at any time accessing it from extension's option page.\n\nOn the same screen you have the ability to login into Sistrix, if not yet. Sistrix login form will be opened in a popup window.\n\nNote!\n - If you don't set a country the fallback (Germany) will be in use, until you set any other country.\n - If you don't login into Sistrix, the badge on the extension icon remains empty, its tooltip and the popup will notify you with a message \"Sistrix login required!\" The ability to login into Sistrix you have from the popup too.\n\nHappy surfing!"
