The user will be given details of the asset transfer in the extension's interface and will be able to perform sensitive operations such as entering a password in a secure environment, which the user can approve or deny.\n\nZKSAFE only read the password entered by user, and erase the information immediately after the asset transfer operation. ZKSAFE dosen't read your private key, so you need to install another wallet extension for the private key management."
