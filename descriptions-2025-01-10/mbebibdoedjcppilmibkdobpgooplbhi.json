META continuously tracks your current focus. Let it run for a while and then use META's powerful visualization tools below to explore your browsing habits.\n\nCurious which site you most often visit after GMail? What sites you visit the most? Or if you have particular sets of sites you tend to look at together? META lets you visualize all of these questions.\n\nRest assured, we don't send your data anywhere. It stays safely on your own computer where you can see and delete it at any time."
