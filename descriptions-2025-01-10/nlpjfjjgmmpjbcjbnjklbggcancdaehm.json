Thus, 'TabIt - NewTab' will make your Google Chrome even more beneficial.\n\nSurely, you have seen the default New Tab page with its 'recently visited web-sites'. You could've seen extensions providing a so-called Speed Dial, based on custom links with icons or thumbnails. And, if you wondered, why don't they ever use your bookmarks as those links â€” well, we did too!) And have developed a solution!\n\nBookmarks are easy to transfer from other browsers, and don't need third party involvement for storing. You can select some folder to be 'Home' for your New Tabs and put the most-often-used bookmarks in it.\n\nThere are four options for bookmarks' thumbnails: Default, None, Captured & Branded. Default and Captured thumbnails are usually screenshots of the corresponding web-sites. Benefits of the 'branded' thumbnails are best revealed, when used in a 'Home Folder'.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts, sorting and other basic operations are available and intuitive. 'TabIt - NewTab' comes in two themes - Light & Dark.\n\nONE MORE THING:  It is very useful to have an access to the list of recently closed tabs & windows in order to open them back, when needed. 'TabIt - NewTab' has a corresponding panel for you, in a click away, in every New Tab.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNOTE:  Operation of this extension requires 'TabIt - BookMarks' to be installed and enabled. It will be responsible for thumbnails preparation and bookmarks creation/editing/sorting/restoring.\n\nTabIt - BookMarks:  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabit-bookmarks/blcimedkggfdbmkpeggbhpdamohlhfcm\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n***** WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT *****\n+ Own server-side thumbnails preparation service\n+ Drag&Drop to the TabIt - BookMarks\n+ Better smoothness by animation\n+ Background images\n+ Other prettification :)\n+ Your suggestions?\n\n***** DECLARED PERMISSIONS ***** UPDATES *****\nPlease, see more detailed information about this extension here:  https://alexperience.me/projects/tabit/tabit-newtab"
