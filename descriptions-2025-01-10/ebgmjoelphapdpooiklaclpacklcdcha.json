The purpose of this mysterious object you will learn by entering the game Stick Monkey Iwinh. The fact is that the road lies in different places: the city, the desert, the mountains, the jungle. Where there is no road or it is difficult. The city of the monkey is going to cross, traveling on the roofs, and there, as you know, the path is not trampled. To easily overcome empty gaps and you need a magic object. It has the property of growing to the desired length and turning into a bridge that is easy to navigate. It remains for you to deftly manipulate the length of the wooden beam so that the length corresponds to the desired distance exactly. The growth of a stick depends on the duration of pressing it."
