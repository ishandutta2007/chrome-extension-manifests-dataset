The regular size is 16 pixels in width and height, but Big Slack Emoji allows the user to choose a size of 22, 32, or 44 pixels. By being bigger, the emoji become easier to see.\n\nSlack is a communication platform mainly used in the enterprise. Emoji are small pictures such as smiling faces and eggplants which can be included in messages on many web platforms.\n\nThe Chrome Web Store is an application platform that requires product text to be informative. To the extent that saying \"makes emoji larger in Slack\" is insufficient.\n\nSo to be clear, here's what's going to happen if you choose to click \"Add to Chrome\":\n- Chrome will download and install the extension, which is built using standard web technologies like JavaScript and HTML5.\n- The next time you visit a slack workspace (such as example.slack.com) the extension finds all emoji on the page. And makes them bigger.\n- Your mouth will turn into a smile as you enjoy the benefit of seeing emoji more clearly."
