That's why I wrote this extension, and it's why I try to keep the code short - so anyone can look at the code and be sure it is not doing anything nefarious.\n\nNote: that this type of extension does not work on the Chrome Web Store pages, you'll have to visit a normal page to see the effect.\n\nYou're encouraged to examine and audit the code yourself, it's relatively short at 58 total lines of JavaScript.\n\nSource code available (MIT License): https://gitlab.com/hoosieree/chrome-extension-obscura\n\nChangelog (starting with version 3.1, see gitlab commit messages for more detail).\n3.1: Chrome fixed their issue with PDFs not playing nice with extensions, so I was able to remove some special case code.  Nice when an update is smaller than the previous version.\n3.2: bugfix - typo caused entire extension to not work.  Solution: remove typo.\n3.3: Remove debug console messages, remove unused code, remove div id.\n3.3.1: Work around some websites not respecting the \"hidden\" attribute of obscura's div, and as a result made the code shorter and simpler. Win-win!"
