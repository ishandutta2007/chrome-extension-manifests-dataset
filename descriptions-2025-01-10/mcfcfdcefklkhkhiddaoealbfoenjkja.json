Please adjust the required settings, then click the - Start - button when the recorder interface appears. The video source may be your screen, window, or tab. Audio can come from your computer's speakers, microphone, or a combination of both. When you push the start button, a pop-up will appear within the interface. This pop-up window allows you to select which screen, tab, or window you want to record. \n\nTo begin, choose the - Share - option from the toolbar. Please click on the - Share - button when you've finished recording to stop it. The recorded video will be downloaded to your computer automatically (to the default download location).\n\nBy default, recorded media is saved in the - webm - format. Please check out this Wikipedia article for more information on the webm video file format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM). If you want to change the file type, use a different piece of software."
