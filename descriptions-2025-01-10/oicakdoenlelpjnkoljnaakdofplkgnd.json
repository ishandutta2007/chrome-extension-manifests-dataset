(You can also set your own shortcut for that)\n\n    • ↑ (Arrow-up): move to previous tab \n    • ↓ (Arrow-down):move to next tab\n    • ⏎ (Enter): switch to selected tab. If no tab is selected, it will search the keyword on the Internet\n    • Alt + w: close all sub tabs for selected tab\n\n【Introduction】:\n    Tab-Tree is aimed to solve a very simple but annoying problem, that is, how to switch to the tab you want quickly if your window opened lots of tabs.\n\n    What Tab-Tree different from others is that Tab-Tree gives a tree-style list for tabs. This tree separates all tabs into different groups by the relationship between the child-tab and their parent-tab, which gives you a better insight for all the tabs. All the tabs opened by same tab will become the children of the tab which opens them.\n\n【Other Features】:\n    • Search: search all opened tabs by keyword.\n    • Bookmarks: search your bookmarks and open the bookmark in a new tab quickly.\n\n【NOTICE】:\n    Tabs which was opened before installing this extension could not be showed in a tree view."
