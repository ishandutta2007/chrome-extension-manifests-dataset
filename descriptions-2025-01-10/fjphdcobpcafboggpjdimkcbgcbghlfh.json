No problem! Our extension is designed to understand your needs. If you highlight text, Ctrl+C will copy just the text, not the URL. It's all about giving you control and flexibility.\n\nUser-Friendly Design: We focus on simplicity and efficiency. There are no complicated settings or configurations. Just install the extension, and it works in the background, ready when you need it.\n\nSecure and Privacy-Friendly: Your privacy matters to us. The extension works locally on your browser without sending data externally, ensuring your browsing habits and data remain private."
