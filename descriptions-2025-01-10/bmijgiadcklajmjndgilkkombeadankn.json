If the internet is a world, what will be the map of it? What do these websites look like if they are houses, gardens or rivers that share the same ground?\n\nThis extension visualizes your browsing activity over the past 7 days by transforming each website you visit into a square displayed on a popup window. The size of each square dynamically adjusts based on how frequently you visit a particular website, with larger squares representing more visits. Additionally, the color of each square is determined by the websiteâ€™s domain name, creating a unique, visually engaging pattern that reflects your browsing habits. This intuitive visualization helps users easily track their web usage and discover trends in their online behavior."
