Webinars generate more leads and more sales than anything out there. More than social media, more than video marketing and more than email marketing. That's because webinars are the fastest way to build trust with your audience and show them how you can serve them with your products and services. \n\nSo why haven't you started doing them?  \n\nProbably because the webinar software options out there are intimidating to use. You might have tried it once but were disappointed that the software didn’t perform as well as you’d hoped.  We know this first hand because we created Webinar Ninja out of frustration with the current so called “solutions” out there.\n\nWebinar Ninja is designed to make your life easier by making webinars simple, clean and professional. We know if it’s not easy to use, you won’t use it. But Webinar Ninja is not only easy, it’s extremely powerful with interactive webinar options and features that make us the most complete solution. \n\nWebinar Ninja’s technology is far more advanced than other platforms because we use the latest Web RTC technology. That means your webinars are always in real time with zero delay and in high quality video and audio.\n\nRun live webinars, evergreen webinars, hybrid webinars, free and paid webinars all with incredible chat features, questions, polls and offers.
