Throw a fit every time someone uses the letters online?\n\nNot anymore! Block such heinous disregard for our sacred \"seven places\" rule by flushing all misuse right down the drainage pipe. No longer will you have to endure the pain of watching internet heathens run afoul of our fraternity's bylaws.\n\nJust install and live happily everafter.\n\nNever again will you have to endure the treacherous click-campaigns on our Wikipedia article, where you and your brothers try to once and for all edit the letters away. Never again will you have to burn your computer monitor in respect for the letters that accidentally graced its screen.\n\nLive with the peace of mind that the war is over, and FIJI has won."
