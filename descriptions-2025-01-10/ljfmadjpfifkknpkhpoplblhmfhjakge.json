Any extra speech will cause the extension to ignore the speech, even if it contains the chess move.\n\nUPDATES FOR V2.0:\n- Improved Speech Correction, so speech can be converted to chess moves better\n- Now Standard Chess Notation can be used (except for promotion). Just simply say the piece and the square you want to move it to. \n- Words like \"to\", \"take\", \"takes\", \"check\", \"checkmate\" and \"pawn\" are optional. Note that you can use \"x\" and \"takes\" interchangeably. So the move \"bishop takes b4\", \"bishop b4\" and \"bishop xb4\" are the same. \n- Note that \"pawn d4\" is equivalent to \"d4\" which is NOT equivalent to \"e takes d4\" nor \"c takes d4\", even if moving the pawn to take a piece on d4 is the only legal move for a pawn, as in Standard Chess Notation.\n- Moves where two of the same piece can move to the same square must be specified with the file or rank that differentiates them, for example \"Rook ae1\" or \"Rook fe1\", as in Standard Chess Notation."
