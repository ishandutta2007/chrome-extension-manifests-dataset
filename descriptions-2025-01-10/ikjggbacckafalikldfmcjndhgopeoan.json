Clicking it turns on following/updating and fills the starburst yellow (just like the bookmark star), clicking again, or closing the tab, turns it off.\n\nWhile following is enabled the starburst will flash twice each time the bookmark is updated. \n\nThe following/updating behaviour is not persistent, you need to enable it each time you return to the bookmarked site.\n\nKNOWN BUG: The regular bookmark star will not show filled yellow even though the page is bookmarked (See screenshot). If you know how to fix this without forcing a page reload, please email me.\n\nAs always, refresh relevant pages after updating.\n\nNew in v0.4:\nAdded workaround for http://crbug.com/86449 that was causing a critical failure.\n\nNew in v0.3:\nFixed bug where (while following) visiting a page bookmarked elsewhere changes which bookmark is updated. Now remembers which bookmark to update by bookmark ID and URL rather than searching for the bookmark by URL each time.\nThe title (tool tip) that appears over an unfilled starburst now says the location of bookmark that will be affected (ie updated when following)."
