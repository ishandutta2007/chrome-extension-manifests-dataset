What the extension does.\nThe extension can be used to collect urls for research papers (or something else). The saved url can be entered manually or saved as the current tab. The extension supports individual url renaming, navigation and deletion. \n\n2. Why users should install it.\nThe chrome has the collection function itself. However, it requires many more mouse clicking and of course the UI is not as pretty. Also when the list is long, it can take even longer to navigate to the paper needed. This extension is more light-weight and easy to use."
