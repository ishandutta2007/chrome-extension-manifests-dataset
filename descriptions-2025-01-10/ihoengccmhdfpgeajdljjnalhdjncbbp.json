That information is then gathered and matched with dozens of unique identifiers to create a profile. \n\nComputer experts call that information tracking “digital fingerprint”, as it can help identify each user based on the collected data. All major browsers have the ability to gather your digital fingerprints during your browsing session, thus creating your personal tracking\nprofile – your digital fingerprint! \n\nThese unique profiles are then sold to advertising agencies,\nresulting in so-called “personalized” popups, commercials and other forms of ads.\nFurthermore, that information can also be abused if it reaches the wrong hands.\nIDX Privacy allows you to proactively deny such profiling and tracking attempts. Without affecting your browsing experience, IDX Privacy will block all tracking attempts made by either cookies, fingerprinting algorithms or other tracking methods – thus allowing you to browse the internet without any personal information leaked.\nBe it your browsing habits, shopping preferences, or social activity – that information is now all yours to keep for yourself.\n\nAd Blocker!\nSurf the web safely and conveniently without being annoyed by flashing banners and distracting ads.\nThe Ad Blocking feature will block both static and dynamic banners, making your browsing experience smoother and faster.\n\nKey Features:\n• Fingerprinting Log Detection and Protection\n• Hiding Personal Information\n• Masking Browsing Preferences\n• Blocking Third Party Trackers\n• Hiding Browser Data\n• Ad Blocker"
