Links are saved as a bookmark card (with an optional note) to a draft post called “Bookmarked links.” If this post doesn’t already exist, it’s created for you. Otherwise, bookmark cards are added to the existing content. If you publish the post or change the title, Ghost Bookmarker will create a new post with the “Bookmarked links” title. One way to use this is to save links during the week, publish your curated link list, and then repeat the process as needed."
