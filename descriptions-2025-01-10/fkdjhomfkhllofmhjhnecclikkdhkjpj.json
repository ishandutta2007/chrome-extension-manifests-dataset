    "ru": "New website: https://magnetstream.live/\n\nHow does magnetstream.live work?\n\nThe WebTorrent protocol works just like BitTorrent protocol, except it uses WebRTC instead of TCP/uTP as the transport protocol.\n\nIn order to support WebRTC's connection model, we made a few changes to the tracker protocol. Therefore, a browser-based WebTorrent client or \"web peer\" can only connect to other clients that support WebTorrent/WebRTC.\n\nThe protocol changes we made will be published as a BEP. Until a spec is written, you can view the source code of the bittorrent-tracker package.\n\nhttps://npmjs.com/package/bittorrent-tracker\n\nOnce peers are connected, the wire protocol used to communicate is exactly the same as in normal BitTorrent. This should make it easy for existing popular torrent clients like Transmission, and uTorrent to add support for WebTorrent. Vuze already has support for WebTorrent!\n\nNo registration needed : We do not track your activity and do not store any data about you."
