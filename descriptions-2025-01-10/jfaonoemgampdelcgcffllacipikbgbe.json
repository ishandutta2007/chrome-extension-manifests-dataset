This feature ensures you can continue watching videos while multitasking, enhancing productivity and entertainment. Whether you're watching YouTube, Netflix, or other video streaming platforms, PiP keeps the video playing in a small, movable window, making it easy to continue browsing, reading, or working without missing a moment.\n\nKey Features:\n\n▪️ Floating Video Window: Watch your videos in a small, adjustable window that floats above all other tabs and windows. You can move it around and resize it for maximum convenience.\n\n▪️ Multitask While Watching: Keep an eye on your favorite videos while interacting with other websites, apps, or tools. Whether you’re working, studying, or chatting with friends, PiP ensures you're always up-to-date on what you’re watching.\n\n▪️ Simple Activation: Easily activate the PiP mode with just a click of the extension icon, or use keyboard shortcuts for quick access. The extension works with popular video streaming platforms, including YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix, and more.\n\n▪️ Customizable Controls: Pause, play, adjust volume, and skip ahead or rewind, all without leaving the PiP window. The video controls are intuitive and accessible, right in the floating window.\n\n▪️ Compatible Across Platforms: Works seamlessly with all major video platforms and ensures smooth performance across your favorite sites.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nOnce installed, the extension icon will appear in your browser’s toolbar. Click the icon while watching a video, and it will immediately pop up in a floating PiP window. You can then drag the window anywhere on your screen and resize it for optimal viewing. You can also customize the window’s opacity, size, and even toggle between different video resolutions.\n\nThis extension allows you to continue browsing, chatting, or working while never missing out on your videos, enhancing your overall browsing experience."
