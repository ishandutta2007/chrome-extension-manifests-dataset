By following one's comments you might notice that a person is a guru and his opinion is valuable for you. Or he might just be a troll and his comments should be ignored. The problem is that it's far more easier to remember people when you meet them than online.\n\nMeet viCard!\nThis extension allows you to save text cards or notes for people you see online. Then, next time you see a person or his comments again you'll know whom you're talking to.\n\nSee overview images for how to use viCard.\n\nPrivacy: your data stays only in your browser and is not transferred anywhere.\n\nNew in version 1.1.x - if you have extensions sync enabled in Chrome then your notes will be synced across all of your Chrome browsers."
