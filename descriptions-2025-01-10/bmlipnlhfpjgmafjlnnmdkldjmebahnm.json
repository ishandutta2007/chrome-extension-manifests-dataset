Each requested website's domain is evaluated for presence on the whitelist, and unless found, the HTTP request is blocked before it even begins. This means that the website will have no record of you ever having attempted to connect.\n\nWith growing amounts of phishing attempts and malware spreading, solely permitting access to user-approved domains presents a strong defense against hackers' ability to redirect users to malintended websites. Website Whitelist aims to implement this system to prevent any such attacks.\n\nPlus, as expected, external tracking and advertising websites are blocked by default. This means that the extension goes beyond the abilities of normal privacy maintaining applications, because it blocks new sites as well.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nChangelog:\n\n6.5.1\n - Added Future Support Warning\n - Added Setting \"Show Support Warning\"\n\n6.5.0\n - Added Setting \"Landing Page Position\"\n\n..."
