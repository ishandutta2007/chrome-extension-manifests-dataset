Familiar with working on a large number of projects simultaneously? Surely, you are using versioning to make your life easy in terms of collaboration and deployment, but what about viewing different instances of the same app in your browser… have you ever changed something in the production instead in your local app instance? Ever messed up badly?\n\nThis convenient extension enables you to register an unlimited number of web applications you’re developing and define different instances with URLs for each one. You can register three different types of web app instances:\n\n* Local - most developers use something like \"localhost/path-to-app\" or define their own paths and create virtual hosts, e.g. “the-app.development.com\"\n* Staging - although most web app development processes support deploying directly to a production server, a lot of them define a staging server that is used for testing and showcasing development changes\n* Production - this is the live application\n\nOnce you registered your apps you will see a recognizable letter icon in the URL bar matching the instance type of the page you are currently browsing (L icon for local, S for staging and P for production). You will be able to click on it to see details about the specific app.\n\nYou are developing on different machines? No problem, your data is synced between browsers when you sign to Chrome with your Google account!\n\nWhat about permissions?\n\n1. Tabs\n\nThe extension requires access to your tabs to check if you are viewing one of your registered web applications and to provide the icon with information in the URL bar for that particular tab.\n\n2. Storage\n\nLocal storage is used to store information about web apps and instances you’re using. The data is synced across browsers if you are signed in with your Google account."
