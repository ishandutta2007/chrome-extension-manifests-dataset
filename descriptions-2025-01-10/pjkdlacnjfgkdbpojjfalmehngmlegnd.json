Thanks to the high speed internet, we can reach all information we need in no time, however it also lowers the barrier to many distractions like social network websites, news, videos. ... \n\nGen4 allows users to type in what they are doing and remind them about that every now and then. Moreover, it also allows users to add web pages into distraction list so that if users want to really focus on doing something, they can turn on Pomodoro mode (for more information about Pomodoro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and be sure that they won't be able to access their distractions. \n\nEnjoy your distraction free browser!"
