It cannot import subscriptions into a new YouTube account; it can only export them. If this is a feature that you'd like to have, please let me know.\n\nIt's 100% free and super easy to do. No ads, and you'll be finished in under 30 seconds.\n\nHere's how it works:\n- First, install this extension.\n- Next, click on the \"Y\" icon next to your URL bar. Don't see the \"Y\" icon? Click on the puzzle piece, and then click on the pin to move it to your URL bar.\n- Follow the on-screen instructions. They're super easy.\n- Finally, you'll have a list of your YouTube subscriptions copied to your clipboard.\n\nThis is what the output will look like:\n\nAdam Savage’s Tested\thttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA\nAndroid Developers\thttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVHFbqXqoYvEWM1Ddxl0QDg\nAustin Evans\thttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGgrKt94gR6lmN4aN3mYTg\nAustin John Plays\thttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIIPl-DSCC0prKxGGnJrdGQ\ncolinfurze\thttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp68_FLety0O-n9QU6phsgw\n...\n\n\nDon't have any text copied to your clipboard? Make sure that you wait until it says that your subscriptions have been copied (it might take several seconds.) If it's still not working, feel free to contact me on my contact email address on this extension and I'll take a look. Chances are YouTube might have updated and this extension might have to be updated as well.\n\nNot working? Comment or email me with the following template so that I can fix your issue faster:\n\nOS and OS Version:\nScreen dimensions:\nDo you have YouTube Premium?\nChrome Version:\nIs YouTube in dark mode or light mode?\nOS language:\nYouTube language:\nTime in UTC that you tried the exporter (you can get your time in UTC via https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc):\nWhat actually happened:\nWhat you expected to happen:\n\nChangelog:\n\nv1.0.5:\nThis is a bug fix release.\n- Fix issue where accounts with just a few subscriptions would not copy to the clipboard correctly.\n\nv1.0.4:\nThis is a bug fix release.\n- Fix an issue where non-English versions of YouTube would not export subscriptions.\n\nv1.0.3:\nThis is a bug fix release, with a change to how subscriptions are sorted. This could be considered a feature, or a bug as it matches YouTube's ordering more closely.\n- Correctly copy channels that are live streaming to the exported subscription list.\n- Sort subscriptions by subscription title, case-insensitively.\n\nv1.0.2:\n- Remove the \"tabs\" permission because it is not necessary.\n\nv1.0.1:\n- Instructions to disable uBlock Origin were removed. Code was reformatted."
