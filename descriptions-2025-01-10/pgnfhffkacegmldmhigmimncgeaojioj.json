They can all be memorized with Cadence. It can also be utilized to remind you to take care of your wellbeing, such as going for a walk or doing some stretches.\n\nIt does this via an automatic flashcard reminder system with silent notifications to reinforce information.\n\n(I really like putting \"Wizard says: \" before my message but that's a personal preference)."
