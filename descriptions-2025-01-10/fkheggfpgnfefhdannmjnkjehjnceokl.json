To fully grasp what's been talked about, a quick check on peps.python.org is often necessary: that means opening a new tab/window, resulting in a small defocus and loss of time.\n\nTo make things smoother, this extension scans all messages on discuss.python.org and add a ℹ️ emoji next to each occurrence of of the \"PEP XXX\" pattern. On hover, a tooltip appears displaying key information about the PEP (retrieved from peps.python.org official API).\n\nTo keep the popup digest, only a subset of PEP information fields are displayed; these may change based of feedback!\n\nMessages loaded when scrolling one the page are detected and processed too (but not just posted / edited messages, at the moment).\n\nThis extension is open-source (hosted at github.com/loic-simon/pep-tooltip) ; it  only requires the permission to read and update content on discuss.python.org. It does not collect any form of data."
