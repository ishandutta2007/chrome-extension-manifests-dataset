You will simply have to enter a short description of the issue you're reporting, decide whether or not you want to add a screenshot and you're done! Please note: Screenshot submitted via the extension will include the display area of your active browser tab. Browser UI elements (e.g search bar, bookmarks etc.) will NOT be included. You will see a preview of your screenshot before submitting it.\n\nFor reporting specific phrases or pieces of text, you also have the option to use the right-click menu. Simply select the text you want to report, right-click and choose \"Report translation issue in selected text to HubSpot\". This will open a new window where you can submit your report following the same process described above.\n\nThank you very much for helping to improve HubSpot's user experience!\n\n-----------------------------\n\nData Processing\n\nUse of this extension is covered by HubSpot’s privacy policy, and we will take the utmost care to keep your data safe and secure. None of the information you submit will be shared outside of HubSpot, and access within HubSpot will be tightly controlled. The data you submit will only be used for the purposes of improving HubSpot’s localization and user experience. It will be permanently deleted after 28 days."
