Today, we are going to talk about the job of a logger. Every day, he picks up an axe and cuts down trees. Today, the main character decided to go further than usual to cut down bigger trees. But while he was working, a big earthquake started. Now you have to find out what happened! When you return home, you will see a big rift formed by the big earthquake. Now, you must figure out how to get to the other side."
