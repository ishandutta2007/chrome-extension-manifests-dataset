This is not an Ad Blocker so it won't be blocked by YouTube. It doesn't block ads but simply presses the Skip button automatically when possible.\n\nThe extension is made particularly for differently abled people who sometimes have difficulty pressing the skip button and to help disabled people skip ads on YouTube if they wish to.\n\nThe extension works...\n - in full screen\n- for multiple consecutive ads\n- for ads in the middle of long videos\n- when videos are playing as part of a playlist\n- when videos are playing in \"picture-in-picture\" mode\n- within less than a second, won't wait for 5 seconds\n\n\nAlso,\n- it doesn't track you\n- it doesn't collect any of your data\n- the code is open source and available to download in GitHub\n- any developer collabroation welcome in GitHub.\n\n*V1.0.0 doesn't do anything on unskippable ads.*\n*Please refresh the page if you have activated/deactivated it*\n\nFeatures in pipeline for future release - \n- mute the audio of the chrome tab for unskippable ads, and bring back to original audio levels after the ad finished playing.\n- fast forward through the unskippable ads.\n- reduce brightness to lowest when unskippable ads are playing, and bring back to original brightness levels after the ad finished playing.\n\n\nPlease contact me and let me know how you would like this to be further improved/what other features would you like this to have. \n\nThis is an open source project - Developers are welcome to collaborate and contribute in GitHub.\n\n\nIf you want to buy me coffee, you can't - I am too lazy to set it up."
