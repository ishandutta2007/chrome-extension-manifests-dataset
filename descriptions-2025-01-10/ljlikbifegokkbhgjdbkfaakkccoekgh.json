It specifically targets the whisper settings on character sheets, providing a toggle to switch between public and private rolls.\n\nThe extension automatically adds this toggle to new character sheets and remembers the user's preference for each character. It also updates the character's whisper type in the game's data model.\n\nThe extension is designed to be non-intrusive, only adding a small control to the character sheet interface. It's perfect for users who want more control over their game settings, specifically the visibility of their rolls.\n\nThe extension is lightweight and focused, doing only one thing but doing it well: controlling the whisper settings on Roll20."
