If you have a question, please contact me on Github instead:\n\n      https://github.com/dmillz/Comic-Text/issues\n\n\nWhat is Comic Text?\n------------------------------\nComic Text is a Chrome extension that seamlessly replaces the built-in Chrome tooltip to enable easier reading of the mouseover title-text for popular web comics, such as xkcd.\n\nNew! Comic Text is now capable of scanning the entire page and replacing tooltips for *any* page element, not just images. Turn on the option by accessing the Comic Text extension options ([Puzzle Piece Icon] > Comic Text [3-dot menu] > Options)\n\nWhat's wrong with Chrome's mouseover text tooltips?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn years past, Chrome's title text tooltips didn't last long enough to read the entirety of the mouseover title text on many popular web comics, such as [xkcd](xkcd.com). By default, Chrome's tooltips disappeared after about 5 seconds; but with Comic Text installed, they will last as long as your mouse remains over the image. \n\nChrome's default tooltip behavior was fixed in 2014 (https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40266368), but this extension still improves tooltip behavior and enables customization of the appearance of the tooltip text for improved accessibility.\n\nDoes this extension work on websites other than xckd.com?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes! By default, the Comic Text will \"just work\" when browsing xkcd.com, and you may use the extension options to customize the styling of the popup, or to enable Comic Text on your other favorite sites. (Access the extension options by clicking [Wrench Icon] > Tools > Extensions, and then find the \"Options\" link under the Comic Text extension.)\n\n\nWhy does the extension require permission to access \"Your data on all websites\"?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe extension works by modifying the HTML/CSS of any pages that are on the whitelist. On image mouseover, the script removes any existing title text of the image in order to suppress the built-in tooltips, and then pops-up a new DOM element, cleverly styled to mimic the default Chrome tooltip.\n\nThe extension requires the \"Your data on all websites\" permission so that it can modify the page you're browsing in this manner, but that's the only thing it does. It does not save any information (besides it's own options), nor does it communicate with the outside world. Everyone is welcome to examine (and reuse, remix, & share) the source code:\n\n      https://github.com/dmillz/Comic-Text\n\n\nComic Text doesn't seem to work on <my favorite site>.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you find a bug, or just have any other question, please submit it as an issue on Github:\n\n      https://github.com/dmillz/Comic-Text/issues\n\nThanks! \n\n\nThe Comic Text popup sometimes gets in my way.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou may dismiss the Comic Text tooltip by right-clicking on it.\n\n\n# Thank you, Randall Munroe\n\nThank you, Randall Munroe, for the hilarious web comic, and also for releasing your work under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/).
