See the full list of enabled languages in the official project's repository (\"Website\" link below) and let me know if your language is missing!\n- Double click on a word to highlight all occurrences.\n- Key binding feature, which allows for quicker navigation through pull requests.\n- Button to collapse diffs in Pull Request view.\n- Autocollapse. Add filename patterns in the Options page that you would like the extension to collapse automatically when the pull request loads.\n- Pullrequest Ignore. Add filename patterns in the Options page that you would like the extension to completely remove when the Pull Request loads.\n- Button to load all failed diffs in Pull Request view.\n- Choose a default merge strategy for your pull requests.\n\nFor more information check out the project's repository (\"Website\" link below)."
