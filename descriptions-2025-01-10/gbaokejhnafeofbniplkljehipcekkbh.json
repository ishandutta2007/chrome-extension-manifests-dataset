It only says this because of the keyboard shortcut that is used to open Tab Organizer.\n\n\n» ATTENTION:\nTab Organizer does NOT save your windows and tabs when you close Chrome. If you want your windows and tabs to be saved, here is what you must do:\n\n 1. Go to Wrench -> Settings.\n\n 2. On the left side, make sure you're on the \"Settings\" tab.\n\n 3. In the main section, underneath \"On startup\", make sure that \"Continue where I left off\" is selected.\n\nNow, if you want to close Chrome, you MUST use Wrench -> Exit to close all the windows and tabs at the same time. As long as you do it this way, then the windows and tabs will be restored when reopening Chrome.\n\nAlternatively, until Tab Organizer gets session save functionality, you could try any of the several session saver extensions currently available for Chrome.\n\n\nDo you have so many tabs that you have a hard time organizing them? No longer! This extension makes it easy to find and manage all your tabs.\n\nHow does it work? Click on the icon in the upper-right to open a popup. This popup lists all your windows and tabs so you can easily see them at a glance.\n\nYou can select and close tabs. You can drag tabs within the same window, or move them to a different window. You can even select multiple tabs at once by holding down Shift/Ctrl (or ⌘) and left clicking on the tab.\n\nYou can also use a powerful search box to quickly find exactly the tabs you want. The syntax is very similar to Google Search, with a few additional features.\n\nPower users can use macros to make tedious tasks like moving or closing tabs much easier."
