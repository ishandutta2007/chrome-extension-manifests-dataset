You create rules for each website saying\nwhich URL pattern to match, the name of the tab group, and optionally a color,\nand the extension will add matching websites to the appropriate tab groups as\nyou browse to them. For example, you could have all jira tickets in a single\ngroup, all amazon pages in another, and all google search results in another.\n\nFor more details, see https://github.com/mivok/tabgrouper/blob/master/README.md\n\n***\n\nQuestions/Answers:\n\nQ: Why do you need the \"Can read your browsing history\" (or \"tabs\") permission?\nA: As you browse, the extension reads the addresses of the sites you, matching them against the rules you write, automatically grouping tabs based on those rules. The extension does not store nor transmit your browsing history anywhere.\n\nQ: Why do you need the \"View and manage your tab groups\" permission?\nA: The purpose of this extension is to automatically manage your tab groups for you, and so this permission is needed for the extension to work."
