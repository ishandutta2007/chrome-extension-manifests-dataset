Can check for specific text on the refreshed page and alert you when it appears or disappears. Waiting for a game launch? Set it to notify you when \"Coming soon\" disappears, so you can be among the first to log in and snag that free year's subscription.\n\nSound alerts: Activate sound notifications for when the specified text changes, so even if you're multitasking, you'll never miss an important update.\n\nZero ads or data collection or anything like that: Just a simple add-on that does the job.\n\nUser-friendly interface: Sleek and intuitive interface makes it a doddle to use: clearly labelled input fields and checkboxes - and a big Start/Stop button. Test the optional audio alert before you use it.\n\nAdapts to dark or light mode: Respects your system/browser settings - see screenshots.\n\nI hope you find it useful. Enjoy. You're welcome!"
