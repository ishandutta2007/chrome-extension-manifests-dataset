As such it needs to communicate with various peripheral devices. This includes but is not limited to sales poll, cash drawer, magnetic card readers, chip & pin devices and more. Many of those devices only support an integration flow which involves communication through sockets, com ports, serial ports etc. Some of devices require low-level (DLL or COM-based) APIs to be called as part of integration flow. SRO plugin assists in that. It runs .NET-based integration components which in their turn communicate with peripherals in an appropriate low-level way. The diagram of JavaScript code - to - plugin - to peripheral communication is illustrated by attached diagram"
