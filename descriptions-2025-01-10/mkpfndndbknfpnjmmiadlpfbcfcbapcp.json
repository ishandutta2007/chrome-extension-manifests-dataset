The user can configure values for utm_content, utm_source, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term, utm_marketing_tactic, and utm_creative_format.  Links in HTML mobiles and dynamic content are supported.  Currently links in image mobiles are not supported as the Marketo API doesn't expose the links in image mobiles. This extension allows the marketer to have a cleaner and efficient way to create UTM parameters but also add them into the email. No other extension, we can find, has both. Furthermore this extension helps to remove human error and can be customized as much or as little as needed based on company objectives. \n\nKeep in mind:\n- The extension only supports HTML and Text modules types\n- The Marketo API doesn't expose link URLs in  image modules so those links (if any) cannot be auto tagged."
