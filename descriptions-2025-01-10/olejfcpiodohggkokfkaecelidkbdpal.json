Capture information, build knowledge connections, share your collection, and easily collaborate with anyone.\n\nJustClip Web Clipper helps you to capture anything you find interesting while browsing. It also includes useful tools to help you browse productively.\n\nSAVE ANYTHING AS CLIPS\n- Bookmark webpages. Mark bookmarks as Read Later for future reading.\n- Capture web screenshots. Capture the entire webpage, a page content section, visible part of the page, or drag and select a page area.\n- Save web articles. Article content is saved as clip description.\n- Hover over any image on the webpage to activate the image clipper to capture images. \n- Right click on the file links on the web page to save the files in your account. Upload docx, images, pdf, ppt, xls, and other file types using their links. No need to first download and then upload.\n\nTEXT ANNOTATIONS\n- Came across an interesting paragraph while reading? Use highlighter to capture the text. Write multiple notes across each highlight. \n- Write sticky notes anywhere across the web article.\n- Use 25 different colors, each for highlighter and sticky notes. \n- Define what each color means using annotation legend.\n- Create private and anonymous annotations when a clip is shared with others.\n- Annotate PDF weblinks on-the-fly. No download required.\n- Quickly load all annotations when you revisit the webpage. \n\nIMAGE EDITOR\n- Before saving, edit captured screenshots using an in-built advanced image editor.\n- Use markup tools like pen, highlighter, shapes (rectangle, circle, oval), lines/arrows to draw attention to key areas on the image.\n- Insert sticker text, note pointer, note arrow to write text on the image.\n- Blur, pixelate, draw solid color shapes to hide sensitive image details.\n\nORGANIZE AND SHARE\n- Organize your Internet library using folders, groups, tags, and interest rating.\n- Easily search for clips using webpage title, url, creation date, tags, and other search filters.\n- Share bookmarks, articles, screenshot clips with your friends and colleagues for discussion.\n- For each annotation, they can write comments and share their opinion using upvote/downvote while reading the webpage.\n\n\n----------------------------------PRODUCTIVITY TOOLS-----------------------------------\n \nWEB TIMER\n- Auto start web timer while browsing any webpage.\n- Use Pomodoro technique to receive timer alerts to take reading breaks at regular intervals.\n- Get insights about total and daily time spent on all webpage domains visited by you.\n\nBLOCK WEBSITES\n- Block distracting websites when you want to focus on work. \n- Eg. block facebook.com on weekdays between 10am to 6pm.\n- Configure blacklist and whitelist website patterns to block or allow websites matching these patterns.\n- Activate the configuration to run on a specific day of the week for a given time slot.\n- When needed, have password access to blocked websites instead of removing it from the blacklist.\n\nSYNC TABS\n- Automatically save all open tabs title and url at a regular interval. \n- Access these tabs on another device or browser. \n- Eg. tabs synced from Chrome on Windows can be accessed in Safari on MacOS.\n\nARTICLE VIEW\n- Read & annotate any webpage in a clutter-free article view. \n- Adjust background and font for stress-free reading.\n\n\nReach us at support@justclip.co to report bugs, share suggestions and feedback to improve JustClip.
