You can decide to visit these sites by spending Habitica currency, which you'll earn by developing good habits and doing chores.\n\n2.Pomodoro Timer:\nIncluding a Pomodoro Timer.\nYou can read about the pomodoro technique here:\nhttps://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Pomodoro\n\nDuring Pomodoro mode, all websites in the list are blocked, websites with cost 0 are blocked only during pomodoro.\nA Pomodoro habit is created automatically for the user in Habitica, with an option in the extension settings to automatically score [+] or [-] of the habit when a Pomodoro is done successfully or fails accordingly.\n\nHow to use:\nAfter installing the extension, click on the icon at the top right to open the menu. In here, you must set your API Credentials. You can then block a site by navigating to it and clicking block site. It will ask you to enter a cost. From this point on, when you visit this site, the extension will ask you if you'd like to spend GP to access it. To start a pomodoro timer simply click on the Tomato character. Click again to stop the timer. In the settings you will find a lot of option that allow you tweak and change the pomodoro behavior to fit best for you.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nFor more information, recommended settings and version update log:\nhttps://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Habitica_Pomodoro_SiteKeeper"
