We do too.\n\nBut it's frustrating to see NSFW works while browsing reddit at work. You don't want to \"accidentally\" click a NSFW post just as your boss is walking by.\n\nA random click on a NSFW post is not worth getting fired over.\n\nSo we built this Chrome Extension. It hides all NSFW posts from reddit. It works like a charm, and we love it.\n\nInstall it today.\n\nDonations welcome:\ndogecoin - D6hfHXH9b1Yq9Tj2GVm645ehKXvLDM7729\nbitcoin - 13BTnCimcPPMfaMVwtADmVE7NtbWTTW2fH\n\nsuch generous. much thanks. very wow."
