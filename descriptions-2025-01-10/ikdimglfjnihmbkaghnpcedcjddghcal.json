This extension will override the default chrome bookmarks manager.\n\nPlease note that this extension is still in Alpha version which may still contain bugs. We're releasing this in Alpha because we would love to have some feedback on what we can improve and make it work perfectly.\n\nMy Bookmarks currently doesn't support drag and drop properly but we are currently working on it. Then our app should be ready for Beta testing."
