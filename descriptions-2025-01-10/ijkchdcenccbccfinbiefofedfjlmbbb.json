It allow you to categorize their tabs based on their use. You can split your tabs into a window for homework, one for shopping, another for work, and the list goes on.\n\nUse the extension by clicking on the icon and it will automatically list all the tabs you have open into an easy-to-read list. Afterwards, you can organize them however you see fit, whether it be into one enormous cluster of tabs or several bite-sized windows.\n\n**UPDATE 2.1.1\n- Fixed an issue where windows didn't close"
