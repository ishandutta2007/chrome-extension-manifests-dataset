Currently supports ESPN.com, The Athletic, and Sports Illustrated.\n\nWAR (\"Wins Above Replacement\") is a statistic that tries to measure a player's total contributions to their team in one hard number. How many more wins did the Angels have because Mike Trout was playing instead of an average player? That's the number Warhead Baseball shows you, to help you tell the good from the best, the bad from the ugly.\n\nSpecifically, the number shown is a player's average WAR per season over their career.\n\nCheck out the \"Warhead NBA\" extension for basketball stats!"
