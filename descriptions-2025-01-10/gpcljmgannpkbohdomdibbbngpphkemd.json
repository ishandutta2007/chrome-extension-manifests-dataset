BrowseGPT uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model to process web pages and issue commands like CLICK, ENTER_TEXT or NAVIGATE.\n\nIs it useful? Sort of... sometimes it will get stuck in a loop, click on the wrong thing, or navigate to a URL that 404s. It provides a reason for every decision it makes so you can help it correct course if necessary.\n\n⚠️ This is an experimental extension and should be used with caution. Don't use this on pages with private information, or pages where taking the wrong action could cause a serious problem. ⚠️"
