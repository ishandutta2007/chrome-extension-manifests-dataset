It's simple, efficient, and easy to use. Follow these steps to get started:\n\nInstallation: After installing our extension from the Chrome Web Store, you'll see a small icon appear in the top-right corner of your browser. This is your gateway to a more customized browsing experience.\n\nCustomize your Experience: Click on the extension's icon and a small window will pop up. Here you'll find a text field awaiting your input. You can enter any keywords that you'd like to avoid seeing in posts. For instance, if you prefer not to see posts containing the words \"Siegel\" and \"Suodaitis\", just type in \"Siegel,Suodaitis\". Once you're done, click the \"Submit\" button and our extension will take care of the rest.\n\nUpdating your Preferences: Changing your mind or want to add new keywords? Easy! Just click on our extension's icon, enter your new keywords into the text field, and click \"Submit\". Our extension will update immediately and start screening posts based on your new keywords.\n\nEnjoy Your Browsing: Now, you're all set! Continue browsing as you normally would. Our extension works silently in the background, filtering out any posts that contain the keywords you've entered. Every time you scroll, the extension keeps checking for new posts and filtering them based on your preferences.\n\nA little tip: When you open our extension's pop-up window, you might see \"Siegel,Suodaitis\" already present in the text field. These are just default keywords and you're free to replace them with your own.\n\nHappy browsing! Enjoy a personalized web experience tailored just for you."
