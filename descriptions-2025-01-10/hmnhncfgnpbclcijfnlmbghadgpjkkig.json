Somewhere fun to go with the kids, to zen out and be one with nature, to expand our minds with art and culture. \n\nWith RealQuik’s Zillow overlay maps, you can see the sorts of parks, museums, boat ramps, and amusements that you want to live near all neatly laid out on top of your Zillow home search. And, for the investment-focused ones among us, look at the “Upcoming Developments” Map to see how Austin’s new light rail projects and booming commercial development are bringing access and vitality to neighborhoods where you might be able to get a great deal to buy today, and an equally great price when you go to sell in the future.\n\nIt’s easy to jump in, just head over to Zillow, fire up a search, and open the map(s) about the things that you care most about.\n\nPlease note: Our maps only currently cover these key locations for Austin Texas, but we’ll be rolling out information to cover the rest of the country shortly. In the meantime, if you’re considering buying a new home somewhere else, why not consider Austin instead?"
