The transcripts help you read back over what was discussed in meetings.\n- The transcripts are downloaded as .md files so you can load them up in your favorite 'Second Brain' app, like Notion and Obsidian.\n- Hint: soon, your meetings will be searchable, stick with us.\n\n• Fine print •\n- By using this application you are acknowledging that you are complying with any regional privacy laws that apply in your area. If you take manual notes in meetings, the same discretion applies."
