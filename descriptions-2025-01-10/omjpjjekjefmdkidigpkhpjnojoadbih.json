Some syntax highlighting and definition links to the ietf.org draft documentation. To download the manifest file, click on the source url at the top of the page. Resources are linked in the manifest to make it easy to test the different parts.\n\nYou can test it out using a sample manifest url like https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8\n\nCHANGELOG\n===========\n2018-03-26 0.9.1 Fixed an issue where URIs with equal signs in them wouldn't get replaced.\n2018-01-29 0.9.0 Added ability to handle MPEG Dash and SMIL formats as well. Better handling of 404 and SSL certificate issues on manifest request. Major contributions made by my friend Joe Greathead.\n2017-12-18 0.8.5 Excluding a few more domains reportedly having issues with this extension.\n2017-06-19 0.8.4 Fixed bug where URIs in tags were incorrectly hyperlinked.\n2017-05-11 0.8.3 Excluding http://video-dev.github.io/hls.js/demo/ to avoid causing issues.\n2017-05-04 0.8.2 added a few more tags to the pattern and definitions list."
