It tracks and stores your browsing habits locally (all your data is stored safely in your browser) and generates recommended content from across the web (youtube videos, tweets, reddit posts and more). You can view and edit your algorithm as you browse the web. \n\nNow, you can add your own content sources instantly beyond the default content sources (twitter, youtube, quora, wikipedia etc.)\n\nJoin the discord if you're interested in contributing and growing the project https://discord.gg/YmVzHUNfYd\nhttps://github.com/jawerty/myAlgorithm\n\nIf you enjoy this extension, please donate so I can build tools like this full time!\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/bjGHFVW355"
