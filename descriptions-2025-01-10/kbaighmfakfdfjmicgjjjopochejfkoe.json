Just take a look at the screenshot. Warning: we have no affiliation with meduza.io.\n\nAs recently meduza.io was designated as a \"foreign agent\" by the Russian government, this professional and objective media is now required to show a warning reminding the readers about meduza's status. You can read more about it here, on meduza itself: https://meduza.io/en/news/2021/04/23/russia-designates-meduza-as-a-foreign-agent and https://meduza.io/en/feature/2021/04/26/meduza-is-a-foreign-agent-now-what-s-next. (Note this black warning in the beginning of every post).\n\nWe, authors of this extension, consider this law to be wrongful. It was created to suppress the freedom of speech in Russia.\n\nPlease, install and share it with your family & friends as a sign of solidarity!"
