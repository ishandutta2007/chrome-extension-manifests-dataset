I wrote it for myself one day to meet my own needs, but I'd really like some feedback.  Can it be improved?  What were you looking for when you came across it?  Does it do what you want?  If not, what is it missing?  Can/should it display more of the image's meta info?  Maybe auto-save the icons of all open tabs into a folder?  Please let me know."
