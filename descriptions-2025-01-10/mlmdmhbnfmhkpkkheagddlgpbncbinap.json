And a bonus: KissCartoon! Just so you may not limit what you're watching to only anime. (If, like, you ever need to watch something else.)\n\n-Background actions!\nEver feel like clicking the button on the logger for every anime you watch? Well, you can do that too... but! Anime logger has background support to save it automatically!\nYou will never have to worry about using your mouse to save anime...\n\nAnd don't forget that Anime Logger blocks all the ads in KissAnime. That counts as a background action, right?\n\n-Fancy switchs!\nJust to change whether or not you want for Anime Logger to spy on every ecchi you watch, you can toggle background log easily off! And if you like like your erotic ads, you can turn them on!\n\n(No pun intended)\n\n\n\nIt's not like i want you to download this or anything...\n\nbaka."
