It also specifically provides lossless transliteration between the main Indian scripts (along with Sinhala). Apart from the simple mapping of characters, Aksharamukha also attempts to implement various script/language-specific orthographic conventions (where known) such as vowel lengths, gemination and nasalization. It also provides several customization options to fine-tune and get the desired orthography.\n\nAksharamukha as of now supports 120 scripts and 21 romanization methods.
