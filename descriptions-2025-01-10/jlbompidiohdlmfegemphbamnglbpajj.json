It retrieves the MFA code sent to your email and automatically fills in your authentication form, saving you from the hassle of manually handling the following steps:\nClicking the \"Send Code\" button.\nOpening your email to find the code.\nWaiting for the email to arrive and copying the code.\nReturning to paste the code into the form.\nMaybe that doesn't sound like much, but I was getting hugely tired of developing into the evening while logged into MongoDB's Atlas UI and then starting the next morning only to find that I yet again needed to re-authenticate (which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the extra requirement of MFA...) One day I really dug into the settings searching for the toggle switch that would extend time login timeout but ultimately was unable to find any such life saver... I guess the joke will be on me if I find out that the setting does in fact exist. Regardless, this was a fun little project, so there's that.\nKey Features\nAutomated MFA Code Retrieval: The extension uses OAuth (read-only access) to your specified Gmail address to fetch MFA codes. This ensures that the retrieval process is secure and seamless.\nEmail Forwarding Compatibility: You can set up email forwarding to a less privileged email account if it suits your security needs better.\nClient-Side Operation: All operations are performed by default on the client side, with no backend server involvement, ensuring that your authentication credentials remain secure and private.\nShort-Term Authentication: The extension maintains authentication with Google for up to an hour (yes, yes, I know... what's the point right... well actually it is still easier because autofill of passwords is already being done, so now it's just extra clicks, but see the next point...).\nLong-Term Authentication (Optional): For those requiring longer offline access, a Cloudflare Worker is used to obtain a refresh token from Google, minimizing the need for frequent re-authentication and maintaining your development workflow with less interactivity.\nOpen Source: The code for this extension is open source, providing transparency and allowing you to verify the security of the extension. As well, it's my hope that others have different workflows but with the same shared pain-point because adding additional code for those should be a breeze. \nHow It Works\nSetup: Install the Chrome Extension MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication Assistant) from the Chrome Web Store, Edge-Addons, Firefox, or via GitHub releases (side-loaded).\nOAuth Authentication: Authorize the extension to access your Gmail account using OAuth. This access is read-only and only used to retrieve MFA codes.\nEmail Forwarding (Optional): If desired, set up email forwarding from your primary MFA email account to another less privileged email account for added security.\nAutomatic Code Retrieval: When an MFA code is sent to your email, the extension automatically retrieves it and fills in the authentication form for you.\nSession Maintenance: The extension maintains authentication with Google for up to an hour. For longer periods, you can use the refresh token option with a Cloudflare Worker.\nSecurity\nClient-Side Operation: The extension operates entirely on the client side, with no backend server processing your authentication credentials.\nRead-Only OAuth Access: The extension uses read-only access to your Gmail account, ensuring that it cannot alter or delete any emails.\nTransparency: As an open-source project, the extension's code is available for review, allowing you to inspect and verify its security measures.\nBenefits\nTime-Saving: Eliminates the need to manually retrieve and enter MFA codes, saving you valuable time and reducing the risk of errors.\nIncreased Productivity: Streamlines your workflow, especially useful for developers and professionals who frequently need to authenticate.\nEnhanced Security: By automating the process and reducing manual handling, it minimizes the risk of exposing your MFA codes to potential threats.\nGetting Started\nInstall the Extension: Download and install the Browser Extension MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication Assistant) from the Chrome Web Store, Edge-Addons, Firefox, or via GitHub releases (side-loaded).\nConfigure Email Forwarding (Optional): If desired, set up email forwarding to another account.\nAuthorize Gmail Access: Follow the prompts to authorize the extension to access your Gmail account via OAuth.\nEnjoy Seamless MFA: Let the extension handle the retrieval and input of MFA codes, enhancing your security and productivity.\nSupport and Feedback\nFor support, feedback, or to contribute to the project, visit our GitHub repository. Your input is valuable and helps us improve the extension for everyone.\nConclusion\nThe MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication Assistant) browser extension is a powerful tool designed to make multi-factor authentication effortless. With automated code retrieval, client-side operation, and optional long-term authentication, it enhances your security while saving you time. As an open-source project, it provides transparency and security you can trust. Install it today and experience the convenience and peace of mind it offers."
