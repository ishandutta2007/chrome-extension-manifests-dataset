We do too. But YouTube wasn't built as an education platform. We aim to improve the YouTube learning experience by providing you with questions about the video that you are watching.\n\nThis extension will add a button below every video that supports question generation. Once you press the button, the extension will generate up to 5 questions based on the video. These factual questions will help you consolidate the knowledge acquired by watching the video.\n\nThe video subtitles are used to generate the questions. Therefore, only videos with English subtitles will be supported (auto-generated subtitles are not included). This covers most videos from top education channels."
