Unlike other translators, it does not rely on the cloud. Your text never leaves your device. And it also works just as fast when you have a bad or no connection to the internet.\n\nFeatures:\n- Translate all text on a website (including highly dynamic sites like Youtube, Twitter)\n- Translate selected text only (Select text and right-click \"Translate selection\")\n- Help you translate text in forms (Right-click a form field and click \"Type to translateâ€¦\")\n\nThis extension for Chrome integrates the features of TranslateLocally in your browser. It works without the TranslateLocally desktop application[1], but if you have it installed, TranslateLocally for Chrome will work even faster and be able to access the translation language models with the desktop app.\n\nThis extension is free to use for personal use.\n\nTranslateLocally is one of the products to come out of the Bergamot project[2]. The Bergamot Project Consortium is coordinated by the University of Edinburgh with partners Charles University in Prague, the University of Sheffield, University of Tartu, and Mozilla. This project has received funding from the ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 825303.\n\n[1]: https://translatelocally.com\n[2]: https://browser.mt"
