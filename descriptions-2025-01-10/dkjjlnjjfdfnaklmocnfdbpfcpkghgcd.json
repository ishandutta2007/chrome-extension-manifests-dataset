This makes your computer faster by clearing up some RAM, and let's you stay organized. So let's say you're doing your math homework and you have 20 tabs open; one is the assignment, one is a google docs page with your answers, and 18 are google searches to see if any of the solutions are online somewhere else. You want to stop doing your math homework for the moment, but you'll need to pick it up later. With \"I'd Tab That,\" you can name and save this session, close the window, and open these tabs later when you feel like it."
