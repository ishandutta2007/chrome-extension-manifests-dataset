This way you'll be able to visalize not only the progress of the video in general, but also how much time is left in the chapter on its own.\n\nThe extension can optionally place a permanent progress bar underneath the main video player that won't disappear when you are not interacting with the video player.\n\nYou can customise the visibility of the bars, as well as if you prefer to display the chapter bar only while hovering over the active chapter, by clicking on the extension icon.\n\nNote: None of the added progress bars are interactive, therefore you can't change the video position by clicking on them. They just display the progress of the video and the chapter independently."
