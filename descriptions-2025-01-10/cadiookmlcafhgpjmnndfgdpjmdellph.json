Nepeto is an Amazon sourcing software, and we have a lead list of tens of thousands of profitable deals our algorithm found. On our website, we showcase all the products in a user-friendly table. This Chrome extension automates reverse sourcing. How, you ask? Because our website contains tons of products from all known suppliers (Walmart, Home Depot, Zoro, and more), you can check if the winning product you found exists in one of themâ€”no need to go to Walmart and the others and search for it. Just add this extension, and it will tell you if it exists in one of our hundreds of suppliers! Go ahead and use it. It's free!\n\nFor other Nepeto's features and products: https://www.nepeto.com/\nThanks !"
