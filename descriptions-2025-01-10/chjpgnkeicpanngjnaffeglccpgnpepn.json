It includes the ability to factor in your commute time and block off certain times of the week, useful to ensure you don't schedule classes during work or other commitments. It creates every possible combinations of classes and lets you choose from the ten (or more) schedules with the lowest distance. Distance is a score given to a schedule that is calculated by adding your commute time multiplied by two for every day you must attend university that week, plus the minutes between each class on a day. Visit http://timetable.student.curtin.edu.au/criteriaEntry.jsf and enter your units to use it."
