Not anymore!\n\nWith this extension you can click the PokeBall on any page that mentions Pokemon TCG cards and it'll scan through the text and add a PokeBall next to any Pokemon it finds. Hovering over that PokeBall will show you a quick preview of that card right in the article! Couldn't be simpler.\n\nI built this for myself because I was new to the game and was annoyed having to keep searching for cards to figure out exactly what they did as I was reading about decks and strategy - so I built this so I wouldn't have to do that anymore.\n\nHope this helps others as well!"
