Anytime you are on a video playback page, you can click the orange Page Action to open a new window with the transcript.\n\nNew in v 1.1:\nTranscript now loads on more pages.  Module #s that are embedded in the middle of a name are now parsed correctly from the query string.  Eg. name=understanding-nosql-m0-what-is from course understanding-nosql.\n\nKey features:\n- Transcript automatically highlights and makes text larger on active module/clip\n- The transcript view will auto-scroll so that you are always able to see the latest text\n- The current segment of the clip that is being narrated will be highlighted in yellow to easily follow along\n- Scrolling up or down past the \"auto-scroll\" area will allow manual scrolling\n\nThis extension is not associated with Pluralsight in any way and is made available as-is under the MIT license.\n\nSource can be seen at https://github.com/lukevp/pluralsight-transcript"
