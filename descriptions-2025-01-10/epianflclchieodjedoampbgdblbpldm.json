As most of the other websites support dark mode, it is kind of disturbing and uneasy to switch to the LinkedIn tab having light theme all over. This little extension provide you the best Dark Mode experience while using LinkedIn on the web without much hassle. Enjoy!\n\nThis is a work-in-progress and will be updated regularly. Incase you find places on the LinkedIn website which need the Dark Touchup please contact us using the support section on the store."
