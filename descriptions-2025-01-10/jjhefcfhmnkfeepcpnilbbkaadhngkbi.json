If you’ve ever used Instapaper or Pocket, Reader is like those, except it’s built for 2023 and brings all your reading into one place including: web articles, email newsletters, RSS feeds, Twitter threads, PDFs, EPUBs and more. You can get started with Reader here.\n• Highlight and annotate the open web.\n\nAll highlights that you make using this extension will be synced with the Readwise ecosystem and, optionally, to your note-taking app of choice such as Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research, Evernote, Logseq, and more.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nNote: You must have an existing Readwise account to use this extension. \n\nIf you are not already a subscriber, you can get a free 30-day trial with no credit card upfront. At the end of the trial, you will not be charged unless you choose to subscribe.\n\n_____________________________________________________________"
