Start by copy+pasting text into the form field, or using the voice dictation tool to convert voice to text. Some users will convert entire sessions in order to copy and paste back into patient record, thus removing the need to pay for other voice dictation tools.\n\nOnce text is entered and scanned, 8th Element will use AI to identify keywords and recommend corresponding CPT and ICD (medical billing) codes. These codes are simple to copy and paste back into patient records, thus ensuring complete, accurate and optimized billing charts for doctors, clinics and hospitals.\n\nSupport is simple and available anytime via a beacon on the plugin that allows contact with 8thElement, as well as access to a knowledge base with FAQs and best practices.\n\nAside from scanning your text inputs, 8th Element also offers deeper Search functionality to find codes and macros for any term you enter. You can also choose to enter multiple codes into NCCI edits which confirms whether certain codes can or should be used in conjunction with one another.\n\nSince the 8th Element software is a Chrome plugin, it is agnostic and works with any EHR or EMR chart, record or system. \n\n8th Element is HIPAA certified and operates in compliance with all best practices with handling of sensitive data. The only data tracked is with regard to usage and traffic, NOT personal or sensitive data. Full privacy policy can be found here - https://8thelement.io/privacy-policy/\n\nWe hope you enjoy our plugin!"
