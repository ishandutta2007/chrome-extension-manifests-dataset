Well... I do. But I really like Unleashed. Here are my current Candies.\n\nEspecially when capturing backups and screenshots of how the Xero integration works. I would like to introduce you to a friend that allows you to open all the accordions for the Xero Extension.\n\nWhy?\nDuring our research, people need to capture screenshots or pull data in a streamlined method. I would like a method that stretches them all open so I can see what lies behind them...\n\nEasy to Use\nBuilt for teams, one toggle switch to activate, deactivate and reactivate. You can play around with it as much as you want, you do not even need to become bored.
