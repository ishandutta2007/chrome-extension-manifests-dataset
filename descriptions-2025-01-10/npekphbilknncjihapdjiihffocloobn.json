It has been significantly rewritten to function as a standalone Chrome application that allows interactive editing of the radar presentation. Rendering has been ported to D3.js from Prototvis and as a Chrome application data can be saved and loaded from the local file system.\n\nThis is also an experiment in small javascript application architectures. It uses no frameworks other that D3.js and jquery. As a an experiment you may find some rough edges, but I believe you'll find it reasonable useful.\n\nThis is the an intial release of an open source project, the source can be found at:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdkrajnak/techradar"
