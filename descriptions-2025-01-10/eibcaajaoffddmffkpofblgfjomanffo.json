This tool simplifies the process of adding a list of stock symbols, using a CSV. This feature has long been delayed by the Kite team, so it was about time I added support for it. \n\nKey Features:\n- Bulk Add 📋: Paste a CSV list of stock symbols directly into the extension, click the add button, and it will automatically add each symbol to your Watchlist.\n\n- Seamless Integration 🔗: The extension works with all my other extensions, Screener to TradingView and Chartink to TradingView.\n\n- TradingView Limitation Bypass 🚫📈: This would also help increase the limit for people who cannot afford TradingView premium by technically increasing your limit to 100 stocks.\nccc\n- Date Prefix Handling 🗓️: Automatically preprocesses input to remove any date prefixes that might be included in your CSV data (particularly for the text supplied by my extension Chartink to TradingView).\n\nHow It Works:\n1. Copy 📄: Copy your CSV list of stock symbols (e.g., NSE:JYOTICNC, NSE:ADANIENT).\n2. Launch the Extension 🖱️: Click on the extension icon in your browser.\n3. Paste and Add ➕: Paste the CSV list into the provided text area and click the add button. The extension will sequentially search each symbol in the Kite watchlist, saving you time and effort.\n\nDid this extension save you time? If your answer is yes, feel free to buy me a ☕️ cutting chai below.\n\nhttps://agamjot.ca/donate\n\nInstall Kite Zerodha CSV Search today and streamline your stock research process on kite.zerodha.com! 📈🔍"
