By simply pressing two keys access the Easy History Extension(Default keys: Ctrl+Space). \n\nCreate Keywords for mostly Used URLs and then you will be able to access those URLs by just typing the Keywords. However big the URL is now you can visit them just by entering a simple keyword so you don't have to remember the URLs anymore and you don't have to go through bookmarks. Easy History also synchronises your keywords so you can access them in any computer chrome window by just logging in.\n\nWith the help of Easy History you can also easily navigate though your Browser history with a very clean interface. You can also choose whether you want the history to be sorted according to the time or your visits to the link.\n\nTime: History will be arranged in a manner such that the last visited link will be on the top.\n\nVisits: History will be arranged in a manner such that the most visited link will be on the top.\n\nTo choose the sorting option go to the options page of the extension(by default the time option is selected).Use the Up/Down keys to navigate through the links and press Enter to visit the link.\n\nChoose between light and dark theme.\n\nYou can change the shortcut of accessing the extension with the help of keyboard shortcuts option in the chrome:extensions page.\n\nUpcoming Feature:\nDelete the history from the extension.\nDelete Keywords.\n\nNotice:Easy history doesn't track your history, the history stays in your browser only and also the keywords you create are secured and synchronised with your account."
