Both of which can allow for centralized monitoring of BitTorrent users, and act as a single point of failure.\n \nDownloads may be initially slower as peer-discovery can take a bit longer if your client hasn’t been running in a little while.\n\nThe extension is also available in the Firefox Add-on Gallery."
