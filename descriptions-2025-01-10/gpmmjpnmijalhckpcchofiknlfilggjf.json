Well, then this extension is for you. ALC changes the look of the Runescape Adventurer's Log to something close to identical to what it used to look like in 2011.\n\n\nNote:\n- Since Jagex decided to split up the alog on multiple pages, the extension basically has to do one extra request per piece of content (one for your recent events, one for your friends' events, one for your quests etc.) This might cause a slight delay before the content is shown on the page, depending on how fast the server responds.\n\n- Feedback/suggestions is/are appreciated! (Be it in-game/pm, email or here on chrome web store)\n\n\nALC only runs on http://services.runescape.com/m=adventurers-log/ and it does not access your account details in any way, it merely reorganizes and restyles the Adventurer's log page.\n\n\nThis extension was created by me, RsHampe (rsn: Farmer Hampe).
