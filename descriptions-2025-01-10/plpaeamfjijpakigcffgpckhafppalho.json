Respond with 'Clean' if the text does not match these criteria or 'Explicit' if the text does match these criteria. If unsure, respond with 'Explicit'.\"\n\nI know this may not follow everyone's definition of what's appropriate, but if this aligns with your values, I hope it helps!!\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Currently, this extension only works with the web version of Spotify.\n- The AI is NOT perfect. It may skip songs that are actually clean or allow songs that are should be skipped. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. However, it should work the majority of the time.\n- This extension is in BETA and is not suited to take on a large number of users at the same time. The number of requests it can make to Gemini are limited, so if the extension doesn't seem to be working, that is probably why. If you wait a minute or two, the resources will probably free up and it should work fine."
