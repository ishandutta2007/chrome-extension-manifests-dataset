In these past few years we’ve seen a dramatic rise in remote learning as universities continually raise their prices or close their doors from COVID.\n\n📃 How it works\n1. Add the extension to your Chrome browser, pin it to the toolbar and create your Prodeus profile.\n2. Connect classes from Youtube📺 to the Prodeus library by hovering over an active youtube video and clicking \"Track my time\". You will also include the category, skill and difficulty of the class.\n3. Prodeus tracks your time spent watching classes and accrues your hours categorically, allowing you to earn degrees in Art & Design, Computer Science, Business, or Academics.\n4. As you accrue more hours, you build up your expertise and level up your ProDegree.\n\nIn our 2.0 launch we added a series of learning tools to provide more structure, better retention and hastened mastery of new skills. We also let you use the extension outside Youtube...whether your on Wikipedia, Coursera, Codeacademy or Medium you can use the learning tools Prodeus provides.\n\n🤔 Quizzes: You and the community can easily create short answer or multiple choice quizzes to help practice your knowledge. Prodeus will ask you to retake these quizzes regular intervals to ensure retention. \n\n📝 Notes: You can take notes while you learn inside the Prodeus widget, easily organizing your notes inside dedicated sections. \n\n🛣️ Pathways: These sections form the building blocks for your own custom learning pathways. Learning pathways allow you to collect and organize educational resources that you find helpful and important (videos, web links, conversations and quizzes).\n\n🎓 What’s a ProDegree?\nProDegrees mirror traditional university degrees. For instance a Bachelors degree requires 3600 class hours, whereas the reflective ProDegree ‘Master’ requires 2000 class hours. \n\nIn our first release of our platform we focusedd on time watched as the single indicator of effort. In our 2.0 release we've brought in quizzes as a second indicator of effort alongside credit for adding value to the community with class/quiz reviews.\n\n📚 Learner-Led Education\nStudies show that learner-led education can yield great outcomes for many students. Prodeus helps you measure your self-education process in a Montessori-style approach, letting you decide what and when to learn. \n\nYou can choose each individual class you take or you can follow curated pathways from user-generated Courses, collections of classes that can take users on a complete journey through a particular topic, skill or an entire field. As users try and accrue large quantities of time they will be confronted with diverse and unique viewpoints and learn various ways to attack any one skill or task.\n\n🚨 Quality Control\nAll of the classes on Prodeus require peer reviews which ends up determining the eligibility of that class to provide credit to students. If classes earn below a 3.5 star rating they will not be eligible to provide credit.\n\nOn Our Roadmap\n🕹️ Integration with Other Platforms: Soon we will allow our users to track their time on Skillshare, Coursera, Udemy, Lynda.\n\n📦 Project-Based Classes: Course creators will be able to add a project to their youtube class so that students can immediately apply the knowledge they’ve gained in a practical way."
