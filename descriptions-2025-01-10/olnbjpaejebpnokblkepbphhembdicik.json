This add-on simply adds a small noise to the actual fingerprint and renews it every time you visit a website or reload a page.\n\nWith the browser's WebGL API, in general, two types of fingerprints can be generated. One with WebGL constants and the other with an image that is rendered with the WebGL API. This add-on can spoof both values at the same time.\n\nTo disable this add-on, please visit the extensions page in your browser and then click on the disable button. Please note that this add-on does not have any toolbar icon/button.\n\nThis extension is made in collaboration with the author of \"Canvas Fingerprint Defender\":\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-fingerprint-defend/lanfdkkpgfjfdikkncbnojekcppdebfp\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/webgl-defender.html)."
