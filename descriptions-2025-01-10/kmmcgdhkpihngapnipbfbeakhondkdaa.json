Redact inflammatory words, rhetoric, and names and see if there are any ideas left on the screen. You can highlight the redicted text to see what is hidden. \n\nWe use the words \"Redict\" or \"Redicted\" to describe hiding the unsavory words used to encourage an emotion. It is a play on the word Redact, which of course, is exactly what we are doing.\n\nMaintain your own words in the settings. New words can be added from our servers, as the aggravating trends change.\n\nPro Tip: Select the Redicted text with your mouse to lighten the background and read what is hidden underneath."
