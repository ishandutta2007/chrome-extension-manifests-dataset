The safety ratings are gathered during controlled crash and rollover tests conducted at NHTSA research facilities. Vehicles with a rating of five stars indicate the highest safety rating, whereas one star indicates the lowest rating. \n\nNCAP provides consumers with important information in making a new car purchase, and for comparable vehicle models, it provides a direct comparison of the crash worthiness of vehicles. Information from this program also exists on the required labels on each new vehicle for sale. \n\nThe Five Star Safety Ratings app provides crash test results in a convenient format suitable for mobile devices."
