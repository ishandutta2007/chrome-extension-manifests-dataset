We defeat the ability of ads and data miners to follow and track your online activity. Install our add-on and watch the \"ME\" counter in action as PrivatizeMe zaps cookies and threats to you online privacy. With PrivatizeMe, you're protected, not profiled, it's simple - no ever changing opt-in or opt-out rules or privacy settings or proxy networks to worry about. \n\nWe strongly suggest you add our free PrivatizeMeSearch extension to set your default search engine to PrivatizeMe.com.
