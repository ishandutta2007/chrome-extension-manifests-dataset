This extension applies a new theme to Quest.\n- Some pages remain as they are to avoid display errors. However, when you want to make sure everything is not going wrong, please disable this extension temporarily.\n- Due to the complexity of the site, this extension prepared separated css and js for each page instead of global ones to guarantee pages are displayed correctly most of the time.\n\nNotes:\n- Try not to use multiple Quest extensions together to avoid unexpected behaviors\n- Quest may change at any time, thus the extension may not function properly\n- If you have any questions regarding this extension, please email me at sam.zj.shao@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimers:\n- This extension has no affiliation with Quest, its developers, or the University of Waterloo\n- Use this extension at your own responsibility"
