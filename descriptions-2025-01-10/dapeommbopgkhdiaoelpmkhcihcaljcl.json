As we continue to test and refine it, you may encounter some bugs and inaccuracies. The star ratings displayed on YouTube videos are still being fine-tuned.\n\nWhile the extension was initially developed for personal use, I decided to share it to see if others find it useful. \n\nIt supports both mobile devices and the new YouTube interface, though some issues may still need to be addressed in future updates. \n\nCurrently, it supports English and German, and may also work with Italian and Spanish, albeit with potential additional bugs.\n\nAs more users provide feedback and download the extension, I will work on improving its performance and accuracy to offer a better experience for everyone."
