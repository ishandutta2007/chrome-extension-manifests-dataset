That file is typically saved in the same file folder as the rest of the code they're working on. However when tthis file is eventually saved to a source control platform like github, that file is not longer viewable online, which means any changes must be exported and viewed locally.\n\nIn order to remove this experience the github-excalidraw-render-extension will extract the .excalidraw file.
