It allows users to store any file and access it at any time. However, there is a limitation to the sharing mode of Drive. When changing a folder ownership, it is unfortunately impossible to pass on the documents contained in the folders, as they remain the property of the departing employee. These files are therefore archived in a service account and are consequently lost. Delego is the Google add-on that enables to assign the ownership of a folder and the files it contains on Drive with one click."
