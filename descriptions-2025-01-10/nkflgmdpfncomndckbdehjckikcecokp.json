Change order of tags, delete them or add new to your works.\n\nThe extension for now only supports already posted works.\n\nHow does it work?\n1. Existing work tags are placed in the extension, where they can be modified - reordered or deleted. It is also possible to add new tags by hand.\n2. By clicking \"Save and Post\", the extension first deletes tags and post the work without them. Then it refills the work with the modified tags and post the work again. The whole process happens in a fraction of a second.\n3. Since the extension is in the early stage we STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO BACKUP YOUR EXISTING TAGS BEFORE USING IT. Take a screenshot of your tags or write them down before using the extension!"
