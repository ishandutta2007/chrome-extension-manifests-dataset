This poses a problem for journalists who live and die (and get hired and promoted) based on their publishing record.\n\nStory Safe is a simple tool (60 seconds to setup) that allows journalists to keep a record of all their published stories. It's a backup, an insurance policy, peace of mind. And it's free.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Periodically capture your newest articles from your author page\n* Track your publishing record on your personal dashboard\n* Benchmark yourself against journalists at your outlets and others\n\nSupported outlets:\n\n* Business Insider\n* Vice (coming soon)\n* NYT (coming soon)\n* The Guardian (coming soon)\n\nMore outlets added by request.
