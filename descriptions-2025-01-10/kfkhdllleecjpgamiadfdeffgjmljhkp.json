This extension can provide a more professional-looking transcript that resembles the official version.\n\nThe resulting transcript is loaded into Overleaf (www.overleaf.com), a popular online LaTeX editor. From there, it can be downloaded as a PDF or further edited.\n\nHow to use this extension\n1. Sign up for a free Overleaf account if you don't have one already.\n2. Navigate to \"Your Grades Summary\" in the Student Service Centre (SSC).\n3. Click on the extension and adjust any options.\n4. Click on \"Generate Transcript\".\n5. Click on \"View Transcript in Overleaf\" to load your transcript into Overleaf.\n\nScreenshots\nImage 1: All Sessions Transcript before and after (with row borders).\nImage 2: Extension popup window.\nImage 3: Transcript generated with \"Group courses by session\" option selected. \n\nHow it works\n1. A LaTeX transcript is generated using the information from \"Your Grades Summary\".\n2. When the \"View Transcript in Overleaf\" button is clicked, an HTML form POST request containing your transcript is sent to the Overleaf API (www.overleaf.com/devs)."
