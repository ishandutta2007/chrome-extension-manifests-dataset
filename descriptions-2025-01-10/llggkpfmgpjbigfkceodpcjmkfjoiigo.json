It uses the two AI methods for generating the summary. One is an online method using OpenAI API, and the other is an offline method using Transformers.js (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/summarization).\n\nTransformers.js is a new machine-learning library for the web. It runs offline in your browser but is rather slow and resource-intensive. Currently, it supports the English language only for text summarization. On the other hand, the OpenAI engine generates the summary from the text content in any website regardless of the language and it is much faster than the offline method. \n\nTo work with this addon, please first open the options page and choose an AI method (at the top). For the OpenAI, please add your API key. To obtain the OpenAI API key, please visit this (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page. Once you choose the AI method, navigate to a website where you want to generate the summary, then press the toolbar button (or the summarize button at the bottom footer of the sidebar). Wait for the extension to complete the operation and generate the summary. The result is then rendered in the browser sidebar. You can change the font color, and size via the options page. Moreover, for online AI there is also a field to add custom prompts for generating the summary. To re-generate or refresh the summary, please press the summarize or reload buttons at the sidebar footer section.\n\nNote: for the online AI, this extension uses OpenAI API to generate the summaries. Please read this (https://mybrowseraddon.com/privacy-policy/page-summarizer-using-ai.html) page to get more info about privacy policies.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/page-summarizer-using-ai.html)."
