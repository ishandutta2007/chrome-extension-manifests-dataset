IT professionals need to find better ways to integrate all information, common documents, applications and workstation resources employees need into a single corporate portal or web based interface while minimizing administrative overhead. IntraLaunch is the missing link to this solution, allowing you to leverage the investment already made in your existing Web infrastructure & Windows based workstations by making the functionality they provide available to your next generation Intranets and Web based solutions.\n\nRequirements\nA small installable connector is required on top of this extension which is available at http://www.particlesoftware.com/dl\n\nIntraLaunch is currently available for Google Chrome on Windows only and is free to try.\n\nConcerned about security?\nhttp://www.particlesoftware.com/secure\n\nTags\nintranet, portal, execute, run, open, launch, interface, web, menu, exe, extranet, kiosk, file manager"
