With this extension, the \"Sell\" button, as well as most instances of the word \"Sell\" on the robinhood.com site to help reduce the urge one might get to dump their position in a moment of paper handed panic.\n\n\n\nNote: I'm an autist college student and made this extension in ~48 hours with zero prior experience writing chrome extensions with a focus on shipping something ASAP rather than making something good. If you run into any bugs, have feature suggestions, or want to make a contribution to the extension, the source code can be found at https://github.com/dylan-cancelliere/robinhood-chrome-extension\n\nNote 2: My application to put this on the store kept getting rejected for stupid reasons like initially only having emojis in the name, so this is launching a lot later than I had initially hoped. But GME is still holding strong, so better late than never."
