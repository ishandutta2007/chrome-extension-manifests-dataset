No matter how well you write, tone is always left open-ended and can be interpreted differently by each person. Well, ToneText clears that problem in a simple way by assigning a tone to a color, those colors are Green being positive, Default text color being neutral, and Red being negative. This concept helps your message not get lost through technology but rather deliver it with a stronger impact. By making a color be positive and negative you're clearing the room for assumption, allowing the reader of the message to understand where you're coming from and how you want your message to be read. With ToneText you're the boss, letting you choose in a message if you want “No” to be positive, negative, or neutral. Instead of the computer telling you whether your message is good or bad, you decide what parts of a message you want to be good, bad, or neutral. \n\nYou may just think why not emojis? Well, emojis aren’t so formal, for example, maybe texting friends you use them. But when it comes to messaging a boss, teacher, or anyone higher up you are respectful and wouldn’t use emojis due to their unprofessionalism. Studies have shown people who send or respond to messages using emojis convey a sort of incompetence.\nToneTexts gets rid of the playful, complex, and unprofessional way of conveying tone by simplifying it from faces and pictures to just 2 colors.\n\nDesigned specifically for Gmail now, and more to come!"
