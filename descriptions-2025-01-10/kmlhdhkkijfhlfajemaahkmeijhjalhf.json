Either youâ€™re working a night shift or sitting in a room with poor lighting, your eyes will get tired and itchy.\n\nBut our extension will help you reduce all the harmful effects. With the Dark Mode app, you can adjust the brightness and comfortable contrast level for all products in your HubSpot interface.  \n\nNIGHT SHIFT TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY SLEEP\nWorking with service software usually takes up the whole day and makes you work on tickets for hours in a row. Set the Dark Mode up in your Chrome, and feel free to enjoy all the benefits that the Night Shift gives. This nifty feature inverts blue light from a screen to warmer colors and makes the light impact less harsh on your eyes."
