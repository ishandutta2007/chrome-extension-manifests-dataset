If you are installing the extension for the first time, select the extension will open the language selection page. Select the language and open the extension once the new page is opened. Then click the \"Configure/Reset\" button. It will clear the extension data and log you out of the portal.\n2. On the AIS portal login page, add your email and password in the pop-up shown by the extension. This will enable the extension to auto-login when the AIS portal logs you out.\n3. On the next page, the extension will ask you to select the application you want to work with if there is more than one live application. Otherwise, it'll directly skip ahead.\n4. On this page, the extension will ask you to choose the city you want to check the slots. Select the city and that's it. Leave the browser tab open and the extension will take care of booking any available slot earlier than your current appointment. It will check for slots every 1 minute by default. You can increase or decrease this number from the extension settings.\n\nThere will be two warnings shown in the above process:\n\n1. The first is when your language is not set in English. The date format matching is designed to work on the English website. While the extension should technically work on any language, it is strongly recommended to change the AIS portal language to English.\n2. The second one is when the current appointment date is not properly formatted. In this case, simply enter your existing appointment date in the format mentioned in the pop-up box.\n\nRegarding the credits:\n\nThe credits will only be consumed when any appointment date is found. In case no appointment is found or you're in a soft block period, the credits will not be used.\n\nSoft block:\n\nThe AIS system shows you no slots for 5 hours when you check for the slots a certain number of times. Sometimes this is 70 checks and sometimes it is only 20. The extension identifies this and automatically adjusts the checking interval to prevent a hard block.\n\nHard block:\n\nWhen in the soft block, if you keep checking for slots frequently, the 5-hour period will extend to 24 hours and sometimes will prevent you from accessing the site from an IP as well. it is best to stay out of this hard block state.\n\nExtension settings:\n\n1. Enable Autobook: If enabled, the extension will auto-book your slots. If disabled, you'll receive a browser notification when a slot is available. You can directly click book from the notification.\n2. Frequency of checks: This setting controls how frequently should the checks be done. Best to keep it between 1 to 3 minutes.\n3. Start Date: This setting tells the extension to not book any slots before this date. Default is today's date\n4. End Date: This setting tells the extension to not book any slot after this date. Default is your current appointment date.\n\nImportant point to note: Do not use any other page refresher to refresh the calendar page. This extension comes with a handler to manager this automatically. If you spam refresh the site, the extension will not function as intended.\n\nFair warning: This is intended to help normal everyday people to move their appointment slots. and not for VISA agents to profit off of it. If I continue to notice multiple uses from IP, I'll start splitting the credits across the all accounts from the same IP.\n\nv3.2 update:\n\n1. New donation link for unlimited credits.\n2. Added option for frequency checker to check anywhere between 30 seconds and two hours.\n\n--------------------\nv3.0.0 update:\n\n1. You can now select a date range for the extension to search for slots.\n\n--------------------\nv2.4.0 update:\n\n1. Added an FAQ Page.\n2. Added an option to pick either the first date or the last date for ASC appointments.\n\n--------------------\nv2.1.0 update:\n\n1. Added support for Immigration Visa (partially tested).\n2. Autobook option is disabled by default.\n\n--------------------\nv2.0.0 update:\n\nAdded some process improvements and browser notifications. When Autobook is disabled you'll receive a browser notification with option to book or ignore it.\n\n--------------------\nv1.0.7 update:\n\nBug fixes.\n--------------------\nv1.0.6 update:\n\nBug fixes.\n--------------------\nv1.0.3 update:\n\nThank you to everyone helping me out in debugging the dates issue. I have put in guardrails around it. I'm regretful for any inconvenience the bug would have caused.\n\n1. Added a new option in the setting to enable/disable auto booking. If disabled you'll hear a buzzer (if your browser supports it) when a new slot is available and you'll just have to confirm the appointment.\n\n2. When the extension has trouble identifying your current appointment date it'll pause and throw in a pop-up asking you to confirm your current the appointment date in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n--------------------\nv1.0 update:\n\nSubstantial under-the-hood changes in the extension. After tons of debugging, identified issues with non-English interfaces. While many of the issue are fixed, it's strongly recommended to switch to English version when the option is presented via plugin.\n--------------------\nv0.8 update:\n\nAdditional bug fixes.\n-------------------------\nv0.7 update:\n\nBug fixes.\n-------------------------\nv0.6 update:\n\n1. Streamlined the automation to ensure no errors and faster process.\n2. Added frequency control.\n3. Checks will happen only for dates that are at least 7 days away from current date. This can now be controlled.\n4. Now works for ASC appointments as well.\n-------------------------\n\nIf extension doesn't work hit \"Reset\" button in the plugin.\n\nThis plugin just does one thing- check for earlier available dates and book the first slot that's available.\n\nLog out from the appointment portal > Install the plugin > Refresh the portal page and follow the on-screen instruction.\n\nUse at your own risk. The extension doesn't mess with AIS servers. It only mimics the user behaviour."
