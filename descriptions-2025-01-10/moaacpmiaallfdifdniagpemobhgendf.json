This tool helps its user to consciously register their consent to web-services they access.\n\nCurrently, the extension supports OneTrust & Quantcast based CMP and few minor providers. I am actively working on the list to keep it up-to-date for a frequent use.\n\nI am releasing the initial tester release for the users to give their feedbacks on this.\n\nSpecial Thanks to xd4rker, Harshvardhan J. Pandit & Dave Lewis"
