It will also recognize True/False Values in Boolean Meta Tags and populate the Value within the browser accordingly.\n\n- No longer are you having to copy and paste your code within the Marketo Template Editor and clicking on the ‘preview’ option to see your template’s changes - you can now see your changes instantly within your browser!\n\n- This extension works best when ‘Live Previewing’ your code using your favourite text editor!\n\n- This extension will not interfere with the Marketo Software and does not make any changes to your local documents. This extension will only provide a ‘preview’ in your Google Chrome Browser when viewing documents locally that are containing Marketo Variables.\n\nPlease visit here for the FAQs: https://tyrellcurry.github.io/projectMBS/\n\nThis extension was brought to you by Tyrell Curry (https://github.com/tyrellcurry) who is part of the Creative Services team at MERGE (https://mergeworld.com/)."
