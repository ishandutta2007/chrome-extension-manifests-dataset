The copy button saves time and effort, especially when the code is lengthy or complicated, as it eliminates the need for users to manually highlight and copy the code themselves.\n\nMoreover, TL Snippets also allows users to view all code snippets present on a webpage without any distractions. The extension retrieves all code snippets and shows them in a popup window, making it convenient for users to navigate through them. With this feature, users can quickly find the relevant code they need and copy it with ease."
