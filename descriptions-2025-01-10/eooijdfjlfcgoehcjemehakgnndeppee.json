Any restaurant can change its status to temporarily offline when the load in the kitchen and/or the amount of deliveries is too high for the restaurant's capacity at the moment.\nIf a user wants to order from a temporarily offline restaurant, the user must wait until the restaurant is back online. To identify when that happens, the user has to stay on the restaurant page, or every few minutes go back to it, refresh, and hope that the restaurant is back online.\nThis process is tedious, and frustrating and requires a lot of time and attention from the user. That's why most users are giving up, ordering from another restaurant, and actually compromising on their not-first priority restaurant.\n\nWoltor is here to solve exactly this problem!\nWoltor identifies temporarily offline restaurants on Wolt.com and allows you to track the restaurant availability, you would like to order from. Woltor will wait for you until your favorite restaurant is back online. When that happens, Woltor will pop up a notification in your Chrome browser that enables you to go directly to the restaurant page on Wolt.com and start your order."
