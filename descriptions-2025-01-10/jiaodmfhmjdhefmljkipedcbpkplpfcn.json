Over the same DNS service, Team Cymru's IP to ASN service is queried to find ASN information for IPs. They are only contacted if you press on the popup. No other 3rd party services are contacted.\n\nThe extension was originally to raise everyday awareness of the global IPv4 to IPv6 transition. Though I found it was also a useful developer tool in finding where your requests are going. So I've extended the extension.\n\nIPvFooBarBaz's action icon shows a large red 4 or green 6 to indicate whether the outer page was fetched using IPv4 or IPv6.  If the page connects to other domains, a smaller 4 or 6 appears alongside.\n\nWhen you click the icon, a table appears with a row for each domain:\n\n- A padlock icon for http://, https://, or a mix of both.\n\n- The IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If connections span more than one address, the most recent one wins.  The address is highlighted in yellow while connections are open.\n\n- \"тно\" for cached requests.  The IP address may be stale if no connection was made.\n\n- \"S\" for WebSocket handshakes. The connection may still be active even if the address is not highlighted.\n\n- \"W\" if data was fetched through a Service Worker.  These requests are linked to an origin (e.g. https://example.com/) instead of a tabId, so the same request may appear in multiple tabs.\n\nClicking on a hostname or address will select it for convenient copying. There are buttons next to it leading to WHOIS, ARIN, RIPE, IPinfo and bgp.tools links.\n\nHostnames longer than 40 characters are truncated in the middle to save space. You can click the (...) to expand, but the full text remains available for copying regardless.\n\nThis extension was forked from IPvFoo (pmarks.net), and contains code from IPvFooBar (vrabel.it)\nIPvFooBarBaz is Free Software (Apache 2.0 license)"
