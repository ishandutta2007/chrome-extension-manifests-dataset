Transform your online academic journey with CRAPTCHA!\n\n 📅 Note from the Dev - \n\n- 1st of all, captcha parser is back. I know  it's been a while, but I'm still working for a 100% accurate offline js lib. that can do it. For now, we'll rely on, with what we have.\n- Improved accuracy of the captcha parser to 90%. it'll still get a few words wrong here and there,  so I have added a paste captcha button for you to manually decide if it's the kindof captcha you want to be pasted in the input box..\n(P.S. - you can always refresh the page, you know)\n - Also , added an offline button that saves the page's value , and stores it for when you don't wanna open the website for little things, like - \nthere's also an easter egg hidden in the button (#letlionsroar) Pages including attendance , marks , and timetable.\n- Added a new table for timetable page, making it easy to  download your timetable as a jpg file. Will add and xlsx button later. do let me know your thoughts on it.\n- Also fixed an annoying bug , where the captcha box doesn't show up , and one has to manually refresh the site. It'll auto refresh the page, until the captcha block shows up.\nthat's it for now... will do minor improvements slowly. I know i haven't released the source code yet, only the crx files. will do once i graduate from VIT.\nfor now this is me signing off\n\n\n\n📥 **Download Now and Unleash VTOP's Full Potential!**\n\n🐛 Found an issue?\n(https://github.com/TheGuyDangerous/v2Extension/issues/new)"
