If a meeting with the given name already exists, you will be joined to the existing meeting, otherwise, a new meeting room will be created with the given name. Anyone with this username and password can join the created meeting. \n\nYou can change the interface template via the template button on the left toolbar. There is also a toggle button to connect or disconnect the app from the WebSocket server.\n\nNote: this extension uses WebSocket (wss://) and WebRTC (stun:stun) servers for communication between peers in the meeting. Please read this (https://mybrowseraddon.com/privacy-policy/web-meeting.html) page to get more info.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/web-meeting.html)."
