If you are like me, probably in the midst of things you end up with some tabs being duplicated and cluttering your tabs bar.\n\nHow can this extension help?\nIf you pin tab-declutter extension it's icon will light up (extension will become active) each time when it detects that you have two or more tabs with the same url opened. The popup will display the list of all duplicated tabs. Clicking on the tab on the list will get rid of it's duplicates leaving you with only one tab containing this url (don't worry, it won't close your active tab)."
