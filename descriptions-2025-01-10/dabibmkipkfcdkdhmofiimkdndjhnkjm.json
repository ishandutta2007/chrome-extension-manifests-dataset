The extension introduces a new file and folder upload feature to the chat interface, allowing users to upload and process data directly within the chat. Upon uploading, the extension automatically breaks down the file content into manageable chunks, sequentially pasting each part into the chat for processing. This feature supports a variety of file types, including text and certain document formats.\n\nAdditionally, the extension is designed to filter out specific, non-essential files, like .DS_Store and Thumbs.db, ensuring that only relevant data is processed by the chatbot. A utility feature checks for the file type upon upload to verify if it's supported and also has a provision to replace any banned words in the text. This extension significantly simplifies file-based interactions with the GPT-4 chatbot, making it a powerful tool for document analysis or bulk data input.\n\nIt now supports .gitignore files. If the extension finds .gitignore file(s), it'll use them and properly ignore files in accordance to the gitignore specified (beta)."
