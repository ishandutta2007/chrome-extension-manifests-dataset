This release is for you folks!\nThere was a release of Trello website on 20 Oct 2023, which removed hidden card number and the total number of each list/column. I had to re-implement these features. It took me some time because Chrome Web Store no longer accepts Manifest V2 extensions. I had to migrate it to Manifest V3. So there yougo: version 2.0.0 is here.\n\n[20170815] Show full label name - fix it to revert the changes Trello did on 7th Aug\n[20170630] Now adding options to disable features excluding aging\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. True age for the Trello card\n\nTrello has a card aging feature, but it does not show the true age of the card in a list. When you add a comment or update the card name, the card will be treated as new. The feature can tell you how long the card has been in the list. No excuse any more!\n\n2. Card number\n\nDisplay the missing Trello card number.\n\n3. Card count for each column\n\nDisplay the card count at top of the columns.\n\n4. Label name\n\nDisplay the label names and still keep the color of them."
