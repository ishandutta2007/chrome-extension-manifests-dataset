For every purchase you make on select items, you will receive ROBUX  back! We receive a commission for some items on the catalog as well as game passes, and we share a portion of this commission back to you! This creates a win-win scenario for everyone involved.\n\nFAQ:\nHow does it work?\n\nEvery time you make a purchase on eligible items and gamepasses, you receive ROBUX  back in your extension's balance. Withdraw this ROBUX  into your ROBLOX account by using the withdraw tab. We receive a commission on select purchases, and we share this commission with you!\n\nHow do I receive ROBUX  in my account?\n\nYour extension's balance will be transferred to https://bloxflip.com. This site will then allow you to withdraw into your ROBLOX account. The website transfers the ROBUX  into your ROBLOX  account through private servers. The ROBUX will first appear as \"pending\" in your ROBLOX account, however in 3-5 days it will arrive in your account and ready to spend!"
