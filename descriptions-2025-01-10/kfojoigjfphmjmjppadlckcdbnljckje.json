Install the extension\n2. Search something on Google Images\n3. Click on the extension icon\n4. Press the large button to cycle through the three modes\n\nDisclaimer: It's not 100% accurate\n\nIt leverages laylavish's \"Huge AI Blocklist\" to identify dedicated AI image sites, but there may be websites that do this that haven't been added to the list yet.\n\nAdditionally, within the extension, \"Nuclear Mode\" includes a stricter list of sites \"that have a lot of AI art/heavily support AI art, but also have some authentic artwork [created by humans]\".\n\nPlease feel free to report issues on Github: https://github.com/partone/Google-Image-AI-Zapper\nAnd request new AI sites be added to the blocklist: https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist\nor request/add new sites on\n\nBig shout out to laylavish for the fantastic list!"
