This extension is great for using Slides for instruction during a Meet, or for presenting on projector. This extension is especially useful for Educators during remote instruction. \n\nYour Meet attendees can see your slides clearly, while you maintain the ability to manipulate and edit the slides.\n\nNavigate through your presentation using your arrow keys, or the scroll wheel on your mouse.\n\nOnce you're finished, reload the page to exit. (Ctrl+R)\n\nDeveloped by Andrew Ranallo and Noreen Ranallo\n\nThis extension does not collect any personal information and does not have any access to your Slides."
