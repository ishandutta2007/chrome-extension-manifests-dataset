Implemented as a Google Chrome extension.\n\n* Decimate models right in the asset window\n* Clean up your materials so only 1 copy of each material remains with models updated\n* Downsize textures with a high quality resample.\n* Copy and Paste components and scripts between entities\n* Copy and Paste between projects (experimental)\n* Colour model view in the assets panel and preview window (no more grey shadows!)\n* See whole of asset name in the asset panel\n* Bake together meshes to reduce draw calls and improve performance\n* Quickly select the Root node and collapse others\n* Quickly select the parent of an entity\n* Powerful search with RegEx, supports component names, entity names etc and returns all matches (unlike the normal hierarchy search)\n* Drop to root - enables items being dropped from the asset panel to be located at the position of the selected entity but then parented to the root - stops accidental creation of complicated deep structures when designing scenes\n* Snap to grid - snaps one or more entities that are already in the scene to the current grid interval - normal snapping in PlayCanvas does not round the existing position, but only move\n items it by grid increments.\n* Snap Rotation - snaps the Y rotation of one or more entities to a 90 degree increment. Useful for laying out levels."
