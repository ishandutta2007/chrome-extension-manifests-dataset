Automatically change all HTTP requests to the secure HTTPS.\nb. All websites (addresses) that do not support HTTPS are remembered to speed up the protocol-check process. Note that you can see and delete these items from the extension's Options page.\nc. The toolbar button serves as the extension's ON|OFF switch. Blue indicates ON and Gray is OFF.\nd. Add desired websites to the whitelist (see Options page).\n\nNote: to report bugs, please visit the extension homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/smart-https.html) and find the bug report form."
