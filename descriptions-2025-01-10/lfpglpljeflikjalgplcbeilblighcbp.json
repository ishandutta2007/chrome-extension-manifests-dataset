Some are reporting polling that suggest more than half of swing voters don’t know about the felony conviction. That is nuts. We need to be saying it all the time. So, let’s normalize the phrase. Remind ourselves to do so & reminder others to do so as well. Let’s make it easy on ourselves - anytime we see Convicted Felon Donald Trump's name it will remind us that he is, in fact, a convicted felon."
