Then I made this extension that is able to copy the contents of a file or several files in a specified directory.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Can copy the contents of files selected by an user clicking the `Copy Selected` button. \n2. Can copy the contents of all of files in the directory clicking the `Copy All` button. \n3. Can search a file by entering a keyword that would be matched with filename.\n\n* If you got a warning such as the very last of the images, you will have to accept it to upload files so that this extension have an access to read.\n\nThis awesome logo was create by Rizki Ahmad Fauzi.\nhttps://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/copy_6597049?term=copy&page=6&position=55&origin=search&related_id=6597049"
