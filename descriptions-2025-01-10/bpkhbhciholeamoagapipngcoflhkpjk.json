Sometimes two sides just isn't enough. If you're studying a language, for example, you might want three sides, to study a word, its meaning, as well as some examples of how it can be used. Multi-flashcards brings that functionality, with an easy way to create new flashcard decks of however many sides you choose, followed by the functionality to customize your testing, allowing you to select how many sides you'd like to study and the order the sides appear in. This way, you'll be able to fully control the way you study, and only ever have to record the information once."
