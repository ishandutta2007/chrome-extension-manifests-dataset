Why using this extension:\n---> If you tired of having boring background of websites and want to change it then this is a solver for you, with this extension you surf your favorite website with a background of your choice.\n\n2. Benefits from this extension:\n- Lightweight extension and optimized, not taking up your RAM and usage\n- No ads and not sending user information to anywhere, everything is running under your local machine and google account (open-source soon?)\n- Works with any other website manipulation extension\n- Help you have a better focus on websites =w=\n\n3. Features:\n- Live Updates on websites whenever the settings changed\n- Able to set the Z-index of the background to wherever you think it works for you\n- Options to remember websites settings\n- Can disable any time you want\n- Dark mode for preview popup and options page or better preview since some websites are dark and others are light\n- Works for local image too (this option actually help the extension to work anywhere since some website restricted to load image from links)\n- Remember your settings across all your devices connected to your account (not the same case for the Local Image option, this require your account to turn on sync)\n- Notice when the URL changed to activate the extension running, this will help on SPA websites\n- Smooth User Interface for better experience\n\nDisclaimer: image URL must be raw image, not the link of some image upload page, to get raw image right click into it and \"open image in new tab\" then copy that link in the new tab. (The link should ended with a image file extension .png .jpeg .jpg .gif etc... videos are not supported)\n\nCHANGE LOG\n---------------------------\n1.1.0 | 20/9/2024\nBig changes with shortcut: \n- Added shortcut keys: opacity up/down, z-index up/down\nYou can change the shortcut binding in your browser settings: chrome://extensions/shortcuts\n---------------------------\n1.0.1 | 11/9/2024\n(dev) background element now is inside a div for easier debugging."
