Are you constantly tabbing over to their playlist to find out what you're listening to?  Give this extension a try.\n\nWhen listening to the station via the web-based popup player, you'll receive small desktop notifications indicating the currently playing artist, track, and album each time the information is updated in the player.\n\nThe extension's options page allows you to set how long you'd like notifications to last (the default is ten seconds).\n\nNote: upon opening the player for the first time after installing this extension, your browser may ask you to allow desktop notifications from chirpradio.org.  Be sure to click 'allow'."
