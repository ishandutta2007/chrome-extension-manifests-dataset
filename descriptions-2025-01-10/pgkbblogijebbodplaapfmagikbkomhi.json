With the ever-increasing use of social media platforms and messaging apps, it has become increasingly challenging to maintain focus and productivity during work or study sessions. The Procastinator extension aims to tackle this issue head-on by eliminating a major source of distraction within WhatsApp Web â€“ the \"stories\" button.\n\nWhatsApp Web, an extension of the popular WhatsApp mobile application, has gained immense popularity due to its convenience and accessibility on desktop browsers. However, one drawback of this interface is the presence of the \"stories\" feature, which allows users to view and share temporary status updates in the form of images, videos, or text. While stories can be entertaining and informative, they can also divert users' attention away from their primary tasks and responsibilities.\n\nTo address this concern, Procastinator seamlessly integrates with WhatsApp Web and removes the stories button from the interface. By doing so, it effectively eliminates the temptation to browse through stories and provides users with a distraction-free environment to focus solely on essential communication and tasks. This enhancement enables individuals to utilize WhatsApp Web as a communication tool without falling victim to time-wasting distractions.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Procastinator is its simplicity and lightweight design. The extension is unobtrusive, meaning it doesn't interfere with the core functionality of WhatsApp Web or add unnecessary complexities to the user interface. This approach ensures that users can seamlessly continue their communication and work while benefiting from the distraction-free environment created by Procastinator.\n\nInstallation and usage of Procastinator are straightforward. Users can install the extension directly from the Chrome Web Store, and once activated, the stories button in WhatsApp Web disappears instantly. Users can then enjoy a focused WhatsApp experience, free from the alluring but time-consuming allure of stories. The extension effectively aids users in managing their time efficiently and boosting productivity during their WhatsApp Web sessions.\n\nAs an open-source project, Procastinator welcomes contributions from the developer community. Francisco Barrera encourages developers to propose feature improvements or submit bug fixes via pull requests on GitHub. This collaborative approach ensures that the extension can evolve and improve over time, catering to the diverse needs of its user base.\n\nProcastinator is released under the MIT License, granting users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the code without restrictions. The licensing information is available in the LICENSE file accompanying the extension.\n\nImportantly, Procastinator is an independent project and not affiliated with WhatsApp or any associated companies. Its development is driven solely by Francisco Barrera's vision to empower users of WhatsApp Web to overcome procrastination and maintain focus on their tasks and goals.\n\nFor any questions, suggestions, or feedback regarding Procastinator, users can directly contact Francisco Barrera via email at francisco.barrera@uptc.edu.co or utilize GitHub's issue tracker.\n\nIn conclusion, Procastinator is a powerful tool that aids users in conquering procrastination and maximizing productivity while using WhatsApp Web. Its effective removal of the \"stories\" button ensures an undistracted and focused communication experience, making it an essential addition to the toolkit of anyone seeking to maintain efficiency and productivity in their digital workflows."
