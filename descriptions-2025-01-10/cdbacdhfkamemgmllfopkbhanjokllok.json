Now you can quickly minimize the panel to free up screen space and maximize it again when you need. Plus, choose from preset size options (Large, Comfortable, or Default) to immediately scale the extension window, making your Webflow workflow smoother and more organized.\n\nKey Features:\n-----\nMinimize/Maximize: One-click button to hide the Webflow extension window, then restore it with a floating “Maximize” bubble.\n\nPreset Sizes: Choose from three custom window sizes:\nLarge (800×600) for comfortable full-panel editing\nComfortable (320×460) for mid-level tasks\nDefault (240×460) to keep the panel small and out of the way\n\nActive Button Highlight: Know at a glance which size preset is currently applied.\n\nUser-Friendly: Simple design integrated directly into the extension header—no complicated setup required.\n\nHow It Works\n----\nInstall the extension from the Chrome Web Store.\nOpen your Webflow project’s Designer (e.g., yoursite.design.webflow.com).\nYou’ll notice new buttons at the top of the extension panel:\n\nSize Controls (Large, Comfortable, Default) to instantly scale the extension window.\nA Minimize button (“-”) to hide the panel.\n\nA floating bubble that appears in the bottom-right corner when minimized—click it to restore.\nSwitch sizes anytime. The currently selected size button is highlighted, so you always know your panel dimension.\n\nWhy You’ll Love It:\n----\nSaves Screen Space: Toggle the extension panel off when you need more room to focus on the Designer canvas.\n\nInstant Window Resizing: Quickly jump between preferred sizes without manually dragging or resizing.\n\nEasy to Use: Intuitive, minimal interface—just click and go.\n\nPermissions & Privacy\nWe only request permission for *://*.design.webflow.com/* so we can inject the helpful controls into your Webflow Designer.\n\nNo personal data is collected or stored; all interactions happen directly within your browser.\n\nSupport\n---\nNeed help or have feedback?
