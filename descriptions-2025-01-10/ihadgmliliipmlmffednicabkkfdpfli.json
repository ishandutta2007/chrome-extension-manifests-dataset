This can be particularly useful for web developers and designers who want to understand how a webpage is styled.\n\nHere are some key features:\n\nElement Outlining: The extension outlines elements on a webpage when you hover over them. This helps you visually identify the boundaries and positioning of the element.\n\nTag Property Display: It displays the HTML Tag properties of the hovered element. This can help you to identify the element itself. \n\nToggle On/Off: The extension can be easily toggled on and off. This means it won't interfere with your browsing when you don't need it.\n\nSupport for All URLs: The extension works on all URLs, making it a versatile tool for inspecting any webpage."
