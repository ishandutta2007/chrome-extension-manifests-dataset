If you like it, play anytime with a single payment (no subscription). Use your upgraded account on up to 5 devices.\n\nThis extension works by acting as a \"virtual\" controller. It listens for keyboard presses and (optionally) mouse movement and translates these into what appear as controller button presses and analog stick movements.\n\nThere is no added input delay introduced by this extension - all keyboard/mouse input is instantly translated into virtual controller input immediately by the extension without any extra software or steps.\n\n(NOTE: This is a fan project - it is not affiliated with Microsoft or Xbox in any way.
