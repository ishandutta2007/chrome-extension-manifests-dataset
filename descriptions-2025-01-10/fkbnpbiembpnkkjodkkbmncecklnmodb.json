All you have to do is set which version of the guides you want and the extension remembers that every time you navigate to any Rails Guides page.\n\nI wrote this because I still work with a lot of Rails 3 apps (and some Rails 2 ones) and its a royal pain to have to go to a Rails Guides page, then type in the piece of the url that makes it go to the Rails 2 or 3 version of the same page.\n\nenjoy.\n\nChangelog\n09/17/13 - Added the ability to switch Rails versions and reload the page and have it instantly redirect to the version you want"
