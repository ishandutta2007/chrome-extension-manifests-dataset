This helps with allowing you to post a picture without leaving your current page. This also helps with when you have multiple tabs open for multiple posts.\n\n-Disabled Auto Fill for Tumblr's New Link Title. This is due to Tumblr.com not allowing URL's in their Title Input fields. We are hoping to find a fix for this soon.\n\nVersion 0.1.5\n\n-Fixed when posting a new link.
