I aim to add more configuration options, as well as an \"open in new tab\" shortcut, as soon as possible.\n\nThis app is based on the design of the Keyboard Navigation extension (available here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyboard-navigation/abcekjakjehkpheoaadhkjfcdodpjbgk). However, this does not seem to be updated any more, and it is unusable on popular sites like GMail and Google Search, where it interferes with typing. So I decided to write my own version from scratch, with the aim to make it as compatible and configurable as possible."
