We're affiliate marketers too!\nIt can be a grueling, time consuming, all-encompassing job. It's our goal to\nlighten the load and give us all some more time for the FUN STUFF!\n\n➤▶︎What is Chickadeasy?\nIt's a paid Chrome browser extension that uses the information on an Amazon or Walmart product page to create an affiliate post using Amazon affiliate links, Walmart Creator links, Mavely links or Shop Your Likes links. You can also use a chickadeasy template to deep link any of those with Amazon or Walmart using Genius Links, or URL Genius. You customize templates in the format that you want, so you can post with the click of a key. \n\nYou'll create posts in less than half the time, allowing you free time that you never thought you'd have!  \n\nChickadeasy includes the ability to clear unnecessary tracking parameters from Amazon and Walmart URLs so you know you're starting with a clean slate every time.\n\nChickadeasy is a paid extension. Learn more and sign up for a 30 day free trial at Chickadeasy.com\n\n➤▶︎Where can I use it?\nWe designed it specifically for social media, but the format building is flexible enough that you could use it for almost anything!\n\nJust make sure to check the TOS of your affiliate connections to make sure you're following their rules.\n\n➤▶︎Multiple Post Formats \nYou choose how many post formats you need so you can customize the extension for your business. From one to Infinity!\n\n➤▶︎Format posts in seconds\nThe Chickadeasy extension lets you auto-create your post with a click on the extension icon (a chickadee of course!), or by assigning a key-stroke combination. Either way you chose, your posts are at your literal fingertips!\n\n➤▶︎Multiple Tracking IDs\nThe Chickadeasy extension allows you to assign different Amazon tracking IDs to each post format.\n\n➤▶︎More time in your day\nPosts take half the time (or less!). Formatting is automatic. Price drops can be posted immediately. If you have codes or coupons, they just need to be added in the post field before hitting \"send\".\n\n➤▶︎All information is Secure\nThe Chickadeasy extension does not have access to your accounts. It gets its information directly from the product page.\n\n➤▶︎Live more or Post more?\nWhat will you do with all that extra time?\nPlay more?\nPost more?\nA little bit of both?\nThe choice is yours!"
