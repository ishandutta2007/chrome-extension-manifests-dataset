Do you really own it?\nWhen acquiring an NFT and making an informed decision, ask yourself where it is stored. \n\nThe NFT Scanner browser extension is an MVP developed to help you discover where NFTs on OpenSea are actually stored.\n\nCheck whether NFT assets are really “decentralized”. More often than not, several projects store NFT media and metadata on centralized servers, controlled by the project team. While you are buying the NFT, the associated media can easily be changed by the team at their will.\n\nIt’s easy - simply install the extension and visit any NFT on Opensea. You will immediately discover the key details of the NFT without having to leave your page.\n\nFeatures:-\nOn-chain spectrum\nDecentralization score\nNifty Analysis\nMedia and metadata location\n\nNote: The NFT Scanner browser extension DOES NOT store or collect your code or data. Also note that this is still a prototype, and some data for non-standard NFT implementations might be missing."
