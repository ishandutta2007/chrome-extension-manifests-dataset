This bell will notify you after 1 minute, 10 minute, 30 minutes of being on Facebook, you will get a gong that will remind you to focus.\n\nA bell that rings to remind us to breathe, connect to ourselves, and avoid destructive patterns and self judgment. It does so at certain intervals, but is also context aware, and aware of the progress or path you are progressing on. Not a crutch, but a learning tool, designed ultimately to be used less and less until it isn’t needed. For people who are learning mindfulness and wish to practice it during their day and would like some help.\n\nWhy?\nThere is no application that you can install that will make you productive. Apps that block things don’t work for long. Mindfulness is the only way we have found to be focused and happy, and that is just a by product of a deeper journey. We found that gentle reminders during our day help us to remember to breathe and be mindful are an effective tool to bring mindfulness and compassion to our daily lives. We hope that by making a more context aware tool, we can help ourselves be mindful especially when we need it, and remind less when we don’t.\n\nWho?\nWe are a two people for whom mindfulness has made a huge impact on our lives. We have used many “productivity” tools that haven’t really worked. Gal is a web developer and a digital nomad, and Shlomi is a designer/developer and entrepreneur. We love making things and people. We hope this will help you on your journey like it helps us."
