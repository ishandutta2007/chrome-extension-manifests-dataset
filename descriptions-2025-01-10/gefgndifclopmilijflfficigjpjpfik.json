This allows users to easily spot their hard efforts.\n\nThe filter for comparing segment times now contains \"today\", \"this week\" and \"this month\", in addition to the already existing \"all time\" and \"this year\".\n\nWhen comparing segment times in the activity view, your best effort is now displayed as \"top X percent\" of all efforts filtered, making it much easier to compare your effort to those of other athletes.\n\nWhen comparing segment efforts you can see the dates for each effort.\n\nIn the ride attributes field, you get a direct link to a historic weather website showing you the weather for the day and approximate location of the ride, and a direct link to Google Maps for the exact start location of the ride.\n\nHappy with the extension? Let me know, or support on me on PayPal: paypal.me/stravaex\n\nSuggestions for added functionality? Let me know and I'll see if I can add it!"
