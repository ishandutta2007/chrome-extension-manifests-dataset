This is an unofficial support extension for the commentary tracks released by Pretty Much It. I am not affiliated with PMI, I am but a humble fan who regularly messed up their sync when accidentally pausing the movie.\n\nThis extension will add a toolbar to the webpage when you click the extension's icon. It will allow you to upload the audio track and have you sync it up with the movie by saving the timestamps where you were told the tracks are synced. After this, the audio track will be linked to the movie player.\n\n- Pausing/playing or moving through the movie's progress bar will have the audio track follow along and not lose the sync.\n\n- Works on any webpage that is playing a movie. Tested with Netflix, Disney+, YouTube and more."
