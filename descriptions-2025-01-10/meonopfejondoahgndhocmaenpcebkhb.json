If there is an attachment in any of these paths, users will get the download button.\n\n\n💡 To better use Canvas files Downloader to full extent:\nTurn off/ disable the \"Ask where to save each file before downloading\" option \non chrome://settings/downloads so that you download the files immediately  without getting the popup dialog\n\n💡💡💡 This extension works for all schools that use Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) / Instructure"
