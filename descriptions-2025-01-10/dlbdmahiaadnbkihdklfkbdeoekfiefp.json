Instead of manually searching for a password within PC Protect, you can now search the vault directly from any web page.\n\nSimply click one of the icons added by the extension to get a list of possible passwords for the current website. Selecting the entry will then add your login information. If you don't currently have any passwords saved for the website, you can generate a new one to add to the vault.\n\nThe extension will detect logins to a website not stored in the vault, or if any existing entries have a different password. You'll be prompted whether you would like to save this new data.\n\nPlease note: this extension requires PC Protect v1.37+ to be installed on your PC / Mac."
