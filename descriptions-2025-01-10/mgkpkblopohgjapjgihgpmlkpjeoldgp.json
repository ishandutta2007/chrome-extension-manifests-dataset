Search all your bookmarks. Wander through your interests and obsessions.\n\n***\n\nWhy wander?\nYou bookmark interesting pages to revisit later. An intention for your future self. But the more you bookmark, the harder it gets to find bookmarks and fulfill that intention. Wander surprises you with a random page that you bookmarked once upon a time. Get back to the places you love.\n\nBrowsers are optimized to create bookmarks quickly. But bookmarks are only useful if we can revisit the places that intrigued us. Currently, revisiting a bookmark is a painstaking plod through hierarchical menus. Wander uses randomness to bring surprise and delight to the process.\n\n\nHow does it work?\nYou can use Wander as a new tab page, or as a browser toolbar button.\n\nClick the ðŸŽ² to open a random page from all your bookmarks. You can also press Enter.\n\nYou can filter down your bookmarks. And open a random bookmark from the filtered results.\n\nOr simply scroll to view all your bookmarks. Click a folder name to open *all* the bookmarks in that folder as tabs."
