You may have to re-toggle the extension on-off-on to ensure it is working. By default, the extension is turned OFF whenever you load into a page, so even if you had toggled it \"ON\" previously, you will have to toggle it \"ON-OFF-ON\" again to restart the Two-Line Evaluation.\n\nDepending on the side whose turn it is to move, the bar will load a slightly darker/lighter shaded section for each side, which represents the difference in evaluation between playing the best move and the second-best move. It may take some getting used to, but is fairly intuitive. \n\nThe best use-case for this extension is for following classical chess, especially where a high-level player may have to make multiple only-moves in a row in a given position."
