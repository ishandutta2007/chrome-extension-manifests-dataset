Left wondering about some reference in the title text?\n\nxkcd explainer provides detailed explanations to any xkcd comic, and displays it below the image for easy access. It automatically takes explanations from the explain xkcd wiki, and parses the wiki markup into HTML.\n\nCurrently, the following formats are available:\n- Headings & Subheadings\n- Bold & Italics\n- Bullet and sub-bullet points\n- Internal links (within the explain xkcd wiki)\n- Wikipedia links (defaulted to English)\n- Other external links\n- Quotes\n- Citation needed links (links to comic #285)\n- Tables\n- TV Tropes links (shows warning to comic #609)\n- References / Footnotes\n\nSince these explanations are provided by people, recently uploaded comics will probably not have an explanation ready. In addition, some comics have incomplete explanations and are constantly being updated. If you would like to help the community (and other xkcd viewers), check the wiki at explainxkcd.com."
