If you're like me and the answer to that question is \"yes\" then have I got the thing for you!\n\nOkay, all it really does is replaces the text \"remember me\" (not case sensitive) with a small gif of Bender's memorial that shoots flame from its eyes and says \"remember me.\"  Just to clarify: the gif does not play sound or shoot flames, it just shows a clip of the memorial doing that :P\n\nNote: At the moment this will replace all text that says \"remember me\" so you've been warned.  Also, I haven't gotten it working in popups yet."
