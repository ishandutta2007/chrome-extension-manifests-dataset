Or tried to remember a saved password which already typed in the password field ?\n\nThis extension gives you the ability to show your passwords by double-clicking on the password fields, and it hides it either by double-clicking again or when you move the mouse away from password fields. \n\nThe extension is completely secure, and all it does is just changing the view locally.\n\nNote: Icon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com.\n\nFeel free to contact us with any question or feedback."
