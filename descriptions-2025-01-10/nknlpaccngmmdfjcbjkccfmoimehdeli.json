Once enabled, a tone is emitted through the speaker and is picked up by the microphone. By moving your hand towards or away from the microphone, you compress or decompress the sound waves slightly which is detected and used to scroll the page.\n\n### IMPORTANT ###:\n- Make sure any headphones are unplugged and the speaker volume is on loud.\n- Be sure to click allow when the extension asks for microphone access. (If you accidentally click block, you can change your preferences by clicking the video icon in the right side of the omnibox)\n################\n\nKnown Bugs:\n- Sometimes when multiple pages are running audio scroll, a lower frequency tone can be heard. (to fix this, disable and re-enable audio scroll a few times)\n\nOpen Source:\nThis extension is open source and can be viewed on GitHub here: <https://github.com/hgarrereyn/AudioScroll-Extension> It is licensed under the MIT-License.\n\nCredits:\nThanks to Daniel Rapp for providing the doppler.js library\nExtension created by Harrison Green"
