Absolutely not.\n- Is this an April Fools’ prank? Sort of, but it’s real and it doesn’t go away on April 2.\n- Why did you do this? Suggested replies  — what Google calls “Smart Reply” — are useful, but they tend to be cheery and bland. It's possible to have whole conversations of nothing but prefabricated responses. This is an attempt to question that particular future.\n- Can a computer have the soul of a poet? Maybe someday, but right now it can only echo the souls of poets past.\n\nFree and open source: https://github.com/chriszs/suggested-poems"
