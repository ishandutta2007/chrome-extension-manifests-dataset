Focusing on efficiency, this tool streamlines your workflow by simplifying searches to VirusTotal.\n\nUpon activation, the extension operates seamlessly: when you select a domain, an IP, or file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256), it automatically opens a new browser tab with the search preloaded on VirusTotal. This feature expedites information retrieval and analysis within VirusTotal, ultimately saving you time and effort.\n\nThe functionality is user-friendly, allowing for easy toggling on and off by simply clicking the extension icon and using the switch. Beyond domains and IPs, the extension also recognizes various formats such as 'domain[.]com', '127.0.0[.]1', and '127[.]0.0.1', expanding its versatility and usability.\n\nThe functionality is user-friendly, allowing for easy toggling on and off by simply clicking the extension icon and using the switch.
