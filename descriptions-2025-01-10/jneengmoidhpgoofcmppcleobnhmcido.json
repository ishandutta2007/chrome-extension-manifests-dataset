With SpinMonitor, IT and SecOps teams have a proactive, automated solution for reducing browser extension risk.\n\nSpinMonitor audits the following key factors:\n- Permissions Review – Assessing the permissions that a browser extension requests, such as access to sensitive data or services, to determine if they are necessary or excessive.\n\n- Privacy and Data Security – Evaluating how an extension handles user data, whether it collects or shares it with third parties, and whether it aligns with privacy policies or regulations like GDPR or CCPA.\n\n- Malicious Behavior Detection – Identifying any potentially harmful or suspicious activities of the extension, such as injecting malicious scripts, stealing credentials, or engaging in phishing.\n\n- Compliance Check – Ensuring that browser extensions comply with organizational security policies, industry regulations, or legal standards related to data protection and cybersecurity.\n\n- Vulnerability Assessment – Analyzing the extension for any security flaws, unpatched vulnerabilities, or weak coding practices that could be exploited by attackers.\n\n- Ongoing Monitoring – Continuously tracking updates or changes in the extension's behavior, permissions, or ownership to detect new risks as they emerge over time."
