With a simple, distraction-free interface, it’s designed to fit into your life effortlessly—whether you’re documenting a win, reflecting on a challenge, or simply noting something you don’t want to forget.\n\nHow It Works\nToday’s Dot: Click the orange dot to write a short journal entry for today (220 characters or less).\n\nLocked Notes: Once the day ends, your notes are saved and locked. You can review them later in fullscreen mode but can no longer edit them.\n\nYearly Review: At any time, export all your notes as a CSV file to keep a permanent record of your year.\n\nYour Privacy Matters\nYour notes are stored locally on your device—never in the cloud. No tracking, no ads, no one else can see your entries. MicroJournal is your personal space, completely secure and just for you."
