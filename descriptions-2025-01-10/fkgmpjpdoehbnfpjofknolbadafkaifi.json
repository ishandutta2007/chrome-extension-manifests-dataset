In order for this to work correctly, you will need to be logged in as an admin already and using Beaver Builder. Why is this extension created? Sometimes due to WordPress's behavior, the top admin bar may be hidden despite being logged in as admin. You can enter a page into beaver builder mode by going to the dashboard and then pages, however this is a bit annoying. With this extension, you can simple click the icon and it will launch the current page into edit mode."
