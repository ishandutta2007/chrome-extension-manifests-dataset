Travelers search for a trip, then Tripkicks appears directly within their Concur Travel Search results. Tripkicks Insights Banner appears at the top of the search results and displays trip level information, custom tips, and automatic safety and travel alerts - providing travelers with the most important insights they need to know about their trip.\n\nWithin each fare below, Tripkicks Supplier Attributes guide travelers to the best options with icons and tips. Supplier Attributes help travelers discover the options that are best for them, and call attention to suppliers with unique offerings or amenities that differentiate them from the others, like hotels that are minority owned or flights on airlines that are most preferred.\n\nTripkicks enables travel managers to influence the decisions of travelers so that theyâ€™re aligned with their program priorities, helping them move the needle on things like sustainability, diversity equity and inclusion, program compliance, and cost savings."
