It listens to \"look to\" and \"stand\" commands from the person running the simulator, and will ring all unassigned bells in the method selected.\n\n--- PLEASE NOTE ---\nThe functionality of this simulator has been superseded by an official simulator on RingingRoom. This simulator will remain available for installation, but may no longer function correctly. \n\nTo run the simulator, install it, and go to a tower room on RingingRoom. You should see a bell icon in the bottom righthand corner of the room. Click on the icon to open the simulator panel, which activates the simulator. \n\nYou can now ring any method with any number of ringers!\n\nIf you need more assistance, please click the '?' at the top of the simulator panel. \n\nIf the icon doesn't appear in the bottom righthand corner of the window, or any other technical issues occur, please contact dev@offenwanger.ca and I'll see what I can do."
