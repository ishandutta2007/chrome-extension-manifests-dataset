It has 1 button that clears browsing history (and all cached data), and 7 other links: canvas.education.tas.gov.au (The Tasmanian Department of Education's learning platform), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ (The link to Never Going to Give You Up) , en.wikipedia.org (Wikipedia in English), start.duckduckgo.com (DuckDuckGo search engine), google.com (Google search engine), & github.com (Open source code platform). The page also contains a mantra (that changes according to the day of the week) which is motivated by Free and Open Source Software ideologies. The background image of the new tab page goes with the mantra. It is compressed for mobile browsers (that can support extensions) but can be used on any other chromium engine that supports extensions. Users should find it useful and motivating if they are avid Free and Open Source Software supporters who also enjoy watching Rick Astley, and use the Tasmanian Department of Education's choice of learning platform."
