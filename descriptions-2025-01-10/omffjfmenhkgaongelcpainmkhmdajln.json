Here are the main improvements:\n- Complete redesign of the UI.\n- Added proper loading and error states to every page.\n- The \"New WR\" indicator will now persist when the popup is closed, and will remain until the category is clicked.\n- Added a button to clear all \"New WR\" indicators at once.\n- Entire games can now be dragged to reorder.\n- Entire games can now be removed at once.\n- Clicking a category on the home page will now redirect to the run, instead of the leaderboard. This is due to an issue with speedrun.com's API where the leaderboard url it returns is not correct.\n\nVersion 2.0.1\n- fixed a bug where category variables were displaying incorrectly\n- made some small style adjustments\n\nKofi: https://ko-fi.com/matttomko"
