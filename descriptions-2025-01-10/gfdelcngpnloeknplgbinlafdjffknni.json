If you aren't caught up on a show, it is very easy to having something spoiled for you.\n\nSpoiler-free IMDb will make sure you don't see the episode count for anybody on the show, whether you're looking at a TV show page, or the actor's page. We also hide the top rated episode summaries completely.\n\nIf you want to see spoilers on a specific page, just click on the icon in the URL bar, and click \"Display spoilers for this page\" and the page will refresh, and display all details, including any potential spoilers."
