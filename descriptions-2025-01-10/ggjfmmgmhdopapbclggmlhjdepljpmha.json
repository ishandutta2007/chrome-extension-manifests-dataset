You donâ€™t want your users to find the bugs before you do.\n\nYet manual end-to-end functional testing is time-consuming and tedious. It is a prime candidate for automation. Record/Replay delivers easy automation testing to everyone, speeding up delivery of production code you can trust. This allows the continuous delivery process to run smoothly at your organization with a quality selection of functional tests.\n\nBeginners benefit from Record/Replay being ready-to-go as installed. No coding skills are required to record and to replay tests. Everything you need to start functional testing is included as part of the intuitive user interface. You can also gain an introduction to different testing frameworks by using our code export functions.\n\nExperienced testers can use Record/Replay to generate short, unique selectors for all element targets, using our built-in CSS and Xpath selector generators. In addition, our code generators produce code for Jest, Puppeteer, Cypress and Selenium Webdriver that you can copy and paste into your testing suites. This can reduce the amount of time taken to create a full-coverage functional testing suite suitable for multiple different browsers, on your machine or in the cloud.\n\nWHY IS IT BETTER THAN OTHER TESTING FRAMEWORKS?\n\nRecord/Replay is free and open-source, which distinguishes it from many other frameworks. We can offer this as there are no cloud-based services attached. All test information is saved in local storage and can be passed from one machine to another via export and import of JSON data files.\n\nRecord/Replay requires zero configuration. High set-up costs can act as a barrier to setting up proper testing, especially for start-ups and those that are looking to deliver proof-of-concept skeleton sites quickly to clients. You can start testing your site in minutes, with no previous experience of Record/Replay or even testing websites in general.\n\nRecord/Replay performs well when compared with other frameworks. If you have wide experience of existing testing frameworks, you know that automated functional testing can be a tricky process to configure and to maintain. \n\nCompared to Puppeteer, Record/Replay benefits from using the Chrome browser itself, rather than the headless version, and supports extensions like Flash. \n\nCompared to Cypress, Record/Replay supports the use of the tab key in user interface testing, allows bandwidth / latency throttling and supports iframe interaction by default. \n\nCompared to Selenium Webdriver, Record/Replay is less flaky (prone to erroneous fails), faster to complete tests and provides better reporting.\n\nOf course, this is only our opinion. Just install and give it a try, then make your own mind up!"
