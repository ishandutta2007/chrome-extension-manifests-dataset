Personally I appreciate the intelligence and elegance of the VNI typing method. It's great to type English terms mixed with Vietnamese. But if you are already using TELEX or VIQR, then vnikey is not for you.\n\nvnikey also doesn't not provide the further features like auto-correct spelling errors. There is the better tools for that.\n\nvnikey focuses on the main purpose: easy to type Vietnamese as long as English. It tries to avoid to place accent marks when you type something looks like English."
