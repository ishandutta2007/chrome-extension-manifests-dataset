Many companies are investing a large number of resources to deliver video on the web. This is changing how we get entertained.\n\nHowever, depending on the country you live, you may face some limitations of right about specific video content that can be delivered. This also concerns subtitles.\n\nTo answer these problems, you can now provide your subtitles.\nThus, for example, if you stay in a country where the streaming provider can't have access to the captions you wish, you can use that extension. \n\nThis is also useful for people that don't like subtitles that the services are providing and so providing your captions."
