This extension works entirely on the client-side. Supports Glassdoor, Blind, and Repvue.\n\nFeatures:\n\nGlassdoor (requires log-in):\n- Bypasses need to write review to see most of site's content\n- Stops popups and scroll locks from preventing site navigation on load\n- Reveals full review text for both employee company reviews and employer responses\n-  Supports the following regions outside of the US: ca, au, br, at, ch, de, es, fr, hk, ie, it, nl, sg, in, nz, mx, uk. If you identify a region that needs support, please email me and I will add it to this list.\n\nBlind (no log-in required):\n- Removes blocking elements that obstruct full text of company reviews and interview discussions\n\nRepvue (no log-in required):\n- Provides complete access to all of the site's content without login or review\n\nLimitations:\n\nThis extension works entirely on the client or user side, and so certain features which are blocked with higher sophistication on the server end of a website will not be able to be unblocked. For Glassdoor and Blind, this can include some salary information in most cases. However, if there are any sections that are still blocked despite this extension and you would like me to look into resolving it, please email me and I can determine if it is something this extension can be expanded to accommodate."
