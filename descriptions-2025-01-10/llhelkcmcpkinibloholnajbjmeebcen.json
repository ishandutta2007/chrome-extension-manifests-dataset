Radhe Radhe~~ !!\nOur Chrome extension is designed to facilitate a seamless connection between your browser and your Tally ERP 9 or Tally Prime software. This tool enables you to fetch and present your Tally data in various customized formats, tailored specifically to your needs.\n\nWe assure you that xlsdeal.com does not and will never store any of your data. The extension functions strictly as a connective bridge between your Chrome browser and the Tally software running on your PC. It acts similarly to an ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) connection, meaning that the extension only works when your Tally software is open and running. If the software is closed or inactive, the extension will not function.\n\nThis extension is built to enhance your experience by providing a convenient way to access and utilize your Tally data within your browser. It is important to note that this tool is purely for connection purposes and ensures that your data remains completely within your control.\n\nYour data privacy and security are our top priorities, and we are committed to ensuring that your information remains private at all times."
