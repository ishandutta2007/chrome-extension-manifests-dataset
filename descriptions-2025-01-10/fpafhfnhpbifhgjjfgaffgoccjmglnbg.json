When you install the extension the very first time it redirects you to the AIS US Visa home page. \n2. Choose your country. (English language is preferred).\n3. Once you have reached to the home page please open the extension pop up by clicking at the top right corner in the chrome browser.\n4. After that you can click on the “Activate the script” which will activate  the extension and it will ask you for your user email and password. This will enable the extension to auto-login when the AIS portal logs you out.\n5. After that you can again open the  extension popup to change the settings of the extension \n\nit includes :\n\n—>✈️  Enable Auto book : which is basically once an earlier date than your target date  is found it will automatically book the date for you.\n\n—> 🟢 Frequency of checks : It sets the time interval to fetch the available dates. Max is 10 minutes and Min is 30 sec.\n\n--> 📅 Select the Start Date : This setting sets the start date. 0=today.\nLet's say if you set this at 10 and today's date is 01/12/2024 this will not book an early date if it is with in 01/12/2024 to 11/12/2024\n\n\n—> 📅  Choose your Target Date : This setting is important as it selects the target date. For example let’s say you current booked date is 31/12/2024 and if you have set slider at 30 days it will calculate your target date as 01/12/2024 which means it will book any date which is earlier than 01/12/2024.\n\n—>♻️ Reset button: it resets all  the settings and once clicked, you’ve to set all the settings again.\n\n*************************\nHow credit works:\n\nExtension will decrease the credit by one only if there is any date found (no matter if it's early date or no). In case no appointment is found, the credits will not be used.\n\n*************************\nWarning: \n\nWhile this extension works pretty well for English language and books the early date as of this release I can’t guarantee that it will run perfectly fine as US website may get changed any time.\n\nI will try to update the chrome extension regularly to match the changes made buy appointment website.\n\nPlease refrain from using any external page refreshers on the calendar page. This extension is equipped with an automatic refresh handler. Excessive manual refreshing may interfere with the extension's intended functionality.\n\n*************************\nV5.25.1.1\n🚀 No More Waiting: removed 15-minute delay when no dates are available.\n🎛️ Customizable Frequency: Take full control by setting the monitoring frequency to your preferred interval.\n📅 Date Range Selection: Now you can narrow down your search to a specific date or range for maximum flexibility.\n🛠️ Bug Fixes: We’ve squashed several bugs to enhance your experience.\n*************************\nV4.24.8.10\n- added tutorial.\n- fixed issue with multiple request to server.\n- added log if time is not found for an early date.\n- fixed location issue for ASC location.\n- other bug fixes.\n*************************\nV4.24.8.2\n\n- This version supports First time date booking, Rescheduling as well as booking dates if you have cancelled the date.\n- Download log option added\n- 405/ ngix error fix\n- Maintenance error fix\n- Price increase\n- and other bug fixes\n*************************\n\nCountry it is supported in  list:\nCanada, Turkiye , UAE, UK, Colombia and many more, full list is available on"
