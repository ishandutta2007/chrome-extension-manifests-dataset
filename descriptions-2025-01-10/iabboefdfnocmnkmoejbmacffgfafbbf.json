With this extension, you'll have level three integration that allows you to mute or unmute your microphone on popular platforms like Google Meet, Teams, and more (coming soon).\n\nAnd the best part? The virtual mute button for the platforms stays in sync with all other methods of muting including the tray icon and your MuteMe, so you'll never have to worry about mismatched mute states. Simply download the free MuteMe app at www.muteme.com/download to get started.\n\nThis extension only currently works with one Chrome profile. Using it across multiple profiles will not work. MuteMe software version 0.15.0 or above is required."
