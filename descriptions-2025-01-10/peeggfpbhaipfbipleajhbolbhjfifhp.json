Or how many times you've clicked? No? That's okay because I made this anyway!\n\n🎮 Style: ClickClount tracks and records your internet stats the same way many video games do. I've always been a fan of total stats collected by video game\n\n📊 Stats: Track the number of pages visited, mouse clicks, and time spent online to gain an understanding of your internet habits.\n\n🌐 Most Visited Page: Discover which website dominates your online presence and the number of visits it receives via the Google API topSites.\n\n🧹 Clear All: Start over again with the Clear All button\n\n🏆 Achievements (COMING SOON): Unlock achievements based on your internet usage milestones. Celebrate your digital accomplishments!\n\n🔒 Privacy First: ClickCount is built to respect your privacy. All data is stored locally (I don't have access to it whatsoever), ensuring your browsing habits remain private.\n\n🔗 Web Navigation & More: ClickCount seamlessly integrates with web navigation, web requests, and more, providing a holistic browsing experience.\n\nThis is my very first deployed web app, I built this to practice JavaScript, HTML, CSS and to familiarize myself with Google's APIs. I had a lot of fun creating this small application and hope to push the needle a little further with each consecutive project. \n\n📧 Contact Information: If you have any questions or find any issues please feel free to email me @Alanvnorcott@gmail.com or go through my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-norcott-31161523b/\n\nThanks for checking this out!\n\n- Alan"
