Visit options and click on Stop.\n- Unread count displayed on button.\n- Desktop notifications can be disabled.\n- Your StackExchange inbox is shown in the panel at the extension button.\n\nAfter installation, request an API token at the options page to get real-time notifications of new messages.\nAlternatively, only set a StackExchange ID without granting the token. (not recommended, because this token is needed for getting the unread count at any given time).\n\nPermissions warnings:\n\n- Notifications - To display desktop notifications\n- Tabs - To focus the new window after clicking on the notification\n\nAlso available as a Firefox Add-on:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/real-time-desktop-notificat/\n\nSupport and information:\nhttps://stackapps.com/q/3780/9699\n\nPrivacy policy:\nYou may specify a StackExchange ID (and optionally use StackExchange's mechanism to grant an StackExchange API token) to enable the extension to function. This data is stored locally only, and only used with the StackExchange API to receive notifications for inbox messages. No other data is collected, and the data is not used for any other purpose."
