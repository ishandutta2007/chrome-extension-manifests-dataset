Dropkiq for Chrome can help in several ways:\n\n* Reduce mistakes by using copy / paste rather than free typing\n* Use text autocompletion when you can't remember the name of an object's attributes\n* Work faster with live previews of your Liquid's output (with test data)\n* Get the hint from the Shopify documentation without leaving your current web page\n* Previews works with filters to show what the filter will do to the output\n* Use Dropkiq with keyboard shortcuts so you never have to leave your keyboard\n\nHere is an example of how you would use Dropkiq in your normal workflow.\n\n1. You're working on a custom theme in Shopify's website\n2. Type your normal text, such as \"Check out my awesome product: \"\n3. When you get to the part where you need to enter liquid, use the keyboard shortcut \"Command + i\"\n4. Use the Dropkiq for Chrome plugin to write out product.title\n5. Press enter to copy the expression to the clipboard\n6. Paste back into Shopify's editor\n\n**Warning: In the first version of Dropkiq for Chrome, variables are static. For example, if you have the following code:\n\n\n{% assign other_product = all_products['wayfarer-shades'] %}\n\nDropkiq for Chrome is not yet smart enough to know there is a \"other_product\" variable. As a work around, you could write your Liquid using the \"product\" variable, and then change the final Liquid by renaming \"product\" to \"other_product\".\n\nDropkiq for Chrome was built on Dropkiq Engine technology. Dropkiq can help your customers write Liquid in your application. Visit https://www.dropkiq.com/ to learn more."
