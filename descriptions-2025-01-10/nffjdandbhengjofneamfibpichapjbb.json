Also, the level and vocation cells are updated and highlighted if they changed since the character’s last login.\n* It makes the character name easily selectable for copy-pasting — just click once on the character name to select it.\n* It makes the world name clickable — it points to the “who’s online?” list for that particular game world.\n* It makes house names clickable _without_ introducing additional XHR requests (unlike other, similar extensions). All house IDs are hardcoded into the extension. The link points to the detail page of the house in question.\n* It makes sure the URL displayed in the address bar is always a permalink to the character profile you’re currently viewing, so that you can always easily copy-paste a permalink to the active profile page. (When entering a character name on the website, it performs a `POST` request and the character name isn’t part of the URL. The extension fixes that too.)\n* It works around CipSoft’s overly aggressing caching on e.g. character detail pages, effectively “fixing” F5 behavior on those pages. (Without the extension, refreshing the page still sometimes results in an outdated response.)"
