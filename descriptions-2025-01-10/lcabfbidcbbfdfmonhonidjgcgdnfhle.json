Hold Shift to open in a new window.\n\n\n⋆ Sessions:\n\nIf you have too many tabs open and want to de-clutter, or if you want to save your work and pick up on a different computer, click the Save button at the foot of the popup. Folderwise Bookmarks saves sessions as Bookmarks, so they will be available on all your devices and can be reopened from the popup.\n\n⚠ To use the Sessions feature, you will be required to grant a new permission to the extension: \"Read your browsing history\". This permission will be used only to access the addresses and titles of your open tabs, specifically to create Bookmarks for the saved Session.\n\n\n⋆ Quick-Save Session\n\nLeaving in a hurry? Right-click the toolbar icon to save and close the current window.\n\n\n⋆ Icon credits:\n\n\"Places folder favorites Icon\" by Oxygen Team is available from\nhttp://www.iconarchive.com/show/oxygen-icons-by-oxygen-icons.org/Places-folder-favorites-icon.html\nand used under the GNU Lesser General Public License\n\nIcons used in promotional images are in the public domain and available from\nhttp://paomedia.github.io/small-n-flat/"
