Kick streams are clear, with a green and white LIVE button on the thumbnail. Click on the thumbnail or title and it'll take you to the Kick stream.\n\nClick on the button to get the popup that allows you to add Kick streamer names. Seperate by comma and add as many as you need.\n\nA very simple extension that requires minimal permissions.\n\nAll made with ChatGPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, I've never coded before so if there any bugs or improvements to make let me know and I will try to fix them."
