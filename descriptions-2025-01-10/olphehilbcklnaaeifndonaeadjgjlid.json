By internally optimizing transaction parameters, such as fees, the extension aims to accelerate confirmation times on the Cardano blockchain. It achieves this by analyzing transaction data and dynamically adjusting fee structures and execution units increasing the likelihood of transactions being promptly mined and added to blocks. \nThe primary function of the wallet lies in its role as an intermediary between transactions processed through a Cardano decentralized application (DApp) and the user's Cardano wallet. Typically, these transactions are executed with fixed execution-units, leading to higher costs in cases where a smaller execution unit will suffice. However, the intercepted transaction undergoes thorough analysis, with a focus on optimizing its execution units. In terms of fees, a slight increment is applied to enhance the likelihood of miners on the Cardano blockchain prioritizing its mining. This is achieved by adding an extra output based on the selected network and balancing the transaction. Traditionally, transactions with higher fees tend to be larger in scale. Nonetheless, by utilizing this priority wallet, even smaller transactions can feature fees substantial enough to garner faster attention from miners. It's important to note that this wallet doesn't involve a seed phrase for generating public and private keys; rather, it functions as a means to expedite the confirmation process of user transactions within the Cardano blockchain.\nAdditionally, the extension enhances usability and user experience by fetching and displaying the wallets they have installed in their browser, allowing for swift wallet selection. Favicon of the visited website is displayed when activated. This visual indicator helps users confirm their selection of the preferred wallet from the intended website, making the process more intuitive and visually recognizable. \nThe extension supports six popular Cardano wallet extensions: Nami, Eternl, Flint, Yoroi, Typhon, and Lace. Users can choose their preferred wallet extension for executing transactions. Additionally, the extension is compatible with the Cardano mainnet and two testnets (preprod and preview), with these selections stored in the user's main browser's localStorage.\nBased on the user's choices, the extension can generate an updated and balanced transaction specific to the selected wallet and network. If the user selects a Cardano wallet extension that is not installed in their browser or if there is a network mismatch between the priority wallet extension and the selected cardano wallet extension, an error will be thrown indicating the reason for the issue.\nTo optimize the transaction, the extension makes three specific API calls. Firstly, it adds an extra payment to the original transaction and balances it. Then, it calls the first API to determine the exact fee required for the transaction. If the transaction includes execution unit fields (which indicate the CPU and memory usage required for execution), the extension makes a second API call to calculate the updated execution units after adding the extra payment. Finally, it balances the new transaction with the updated fee and execution units, and the third API call is made to submit the transaction.\nThis browser extension is suitable for both casual users and developers engaged in creating Cardano-based decentralized applications. For developers, it streamlines the process of conducting on-chain tests for smart contracts, facilitating faster iterations and debugging. Meanwhile, general users can take advantage of quicker transaction confirmations in various scenarios such as blockchain auctions or NFT purchases, enhancing their overall experience with Cardano-based applications."
