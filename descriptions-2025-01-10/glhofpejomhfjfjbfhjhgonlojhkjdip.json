Upload your JSON file - it will display a set of fields. Remember that you can translate only strings (objects/arrays with strings), other values would be kept \"as is\" in source file (translator wouldn't even see them).\n2. You can create a translation using merge functionality, for example when your translator did translation for file v1 but you add some changes after, they would be able to upload your file as source and translated file as target and all similar fields would be replaced.\n3. You can use search to find needed element by key or to find some misprint and quick fix it.\n4. All this staff working only on client side, so you shouldn't be worry that you data would be kept somewhere."
