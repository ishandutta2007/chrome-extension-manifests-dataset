This ensures a higher level of privacy and anonymity as your browsing habits and sensitive information won't be stored on your device.\n\n-    Temporary Sessions: Incognito mode allows you to create temporary browsing sessions separate from your regular browsing. This can be helpful when you want to access a website without leaving any traces, especially if you are using a public or shared computer.\n\n-    Avoiding Autofill Conflicts: Incognito mode prevents the browser from using your stored autofill data, such as passwords and usernames. This is useful when you want to log in to a different account on a website without encountering conflicts with the data saved for your regular browsing session.\n\n-    Testing and Debugging: Web developers often find incognito mode useful for testing websites without any cached data interfering. It ensures that they are viewing the most up-to-date version of a webpage and helps them identify potential issues that may arise for new or first-time users.\n\n-    Research and Sensitive Topics: When conducting research on sensitive or personal topics, using incognito mode can help avoid personalized search results and suggestions. It reduces the risk of biased or targeted information being displayed based on your previous browsing habits.\n\n-    Preventing Tracking: Incognito mode can be effective in reducing the extent to which websites and advertisers can track your online behavior. While it doesn't provide complete anonymity or protection from all tracking methods, it does limit the amount of data collected during that specific browsing session.\n\n-    Guest Browsing: If you're sharing your device with someone else, using the Incognito Mode extension allows them to browse without accessing your bookmarks, passwords, and other saved data. Once the incognito tab is closed, all browsing activity in that session is discarded."
