It does this by giving you a consistent sparkline representing your passwords. On any site you visit with a password field, start typing, and a little colored sparkline will appear. This is your clue - try and remember something about the color, shape, or both. Before you know it, your login error rate will drop immensely.\n\nOf course, it's just an aid - if you can't remember all your sparklines, don't worry about it! It's just a visual aid. Use it, or not, however you want. Perhaps only remembering one or two really important sparklines for a password you forget or mistype often would be useful, or perhaps you can try to remember all of them. Either way, it's up to you.\n\nInspired by this demo: http://goo.gl/2To7k"
