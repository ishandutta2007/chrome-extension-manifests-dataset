Because content extracting is hand picked it currently it works for Hackernews, Stackoverflow, Twitter, Reddit, Github and Youtube,  supported pages can be and will be extended and with less effort.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhen you visit one of the supported pages or with the interactions on the page (e.g. retweet or navigation on page) a new record is created and saved in your browser's storage. A record consists of metadata (time, link, ..) and the required content extracted from website.\n\nSince all records are kept in your browser's storage, later you can search your history on supported pages pretty effectively.\n\n\nIs it safe?\n\nAll data is stored in your device, nothing is sent or shared. It's also open source, all the code can be inspected and you can learn more on https://github.com/diki/surflog\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://github.com/diki/surflog/blob/master/privacy_policy.md"
