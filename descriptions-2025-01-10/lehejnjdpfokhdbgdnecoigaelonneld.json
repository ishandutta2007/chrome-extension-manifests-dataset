Because these errors are under the surface, you may not even be aware that anything is wrong. It will make suggestions that may help FamilySearch find additional matches. It will find simple cleanup items like date and location inconsistencies. Best of all, it makes fixing these simple issues fast and easy!\n\nValidator checks that the information currently in FamilySearch about your family is 'reasonable'. That means common sense tests are applied EVERYWHERE (and if I've missed some, please let me know). It checks all of the information currently available, comparing husband and wife, children, parents and siblings. The extension further checks each attached source record that the information was fully added into FamilySearch. This saves you massive time in doing this review yourself!\n\nTO BEGIN: Install the extension and then return to FamilySearch and login. As you access a person's page, click on the Validator icon in the upper right of your browser. (If you don't see the  icon, click on the extension icon - looks like a puzzle piece - and then on the 'pin' next to Family Tree Validator.) The person's name will appear on a small popup window. To validate them, simply click on the \"Validate This Person\" button. During Validation, the person and their family will be displayed on a separate Progress page, along with any information about them that needs to be reviewed.\n\nTo help you with your use of Validator, full help and suggestions are located on our website FindMyRoots.tech/help. Once you are comfortable with the Family Tree Validator's default operation, go to the options page (right-click on the green check icon in the upper right) to change the suggestions Validator makes. Validation should be viewed as a process rather than an event. As items are corrected and added, FamilySearch may find more items to be added to your tree.\n\nLastly, we appreciate your use of the Family Tree Validator as it continues to grow and be enhanced. However, despite best our efforts to make everything work as expected, you may find issues in its use. We believe the potential benefits far outweigh any problems that may occur. Please report any errors, items missed, things that could be checked, or plain old suggestions to FindMyRoots.tech@gmail.com or on our website FindMyRoots.tech/support.."
