The Greyscale Extension offers a unique solution to alleviate eye strain and promote visual comfort. By converting webpages to greyscale, it reduces the harsh contrast and vibrant colors that can strain the eyes. The subtle shades of grey create a more soothing and balanced visual experience. This not only helps individuals with existing eye conditions but also prevents potential eye strain for those who spend long hours browsing the internet. With the Greyscale Extension, users can enjoy a more relaxed and comfortable browsing experience while prioritizing their eye health in the digital era."
