Unfortunately, passwords that are long, random-looking and hard to guess are also difficult to remember. Memorable Password Generator helps you get the best of both, a strong password and an easier to remember one.\n\nThe way it works is simple, when you click the browser action button, the password is generated and you can copy it one one click. If the password does not look good, you can generate another one in one click.\n\nWhat really makes Memorable Password Generator special is that, unlike most secure password generators, it doesn't output totally random and hard-to-remember passwords. Instead, the password is generated with recognizable words, but with random letters, capitals and random special characters included. It makes the password harder to guess, but at the same time, easier to remember as it is composed of real words.\n\nMemorable Password Generator is fully secure and no password is stored. Passwords are only shown to you when generated and disappear when you close the extension popup.\n\nYou can also completely customize the patterns for your generated passwords.\nFor example setup a password pattern such as {0-9}{0-9}{0-9}_{word}{WORD}{symbol} or {word?}{symbol}{Word}66\n\nHere's a list of items you can use for your custom password pattern :\n\n{WORD} : random uppercase word\n{word} : random lowercase word\n{Word} : random capitalized word\n{word?} : random word with random case (lowercase, uppercase or capitalized)\n{symbol} : random symbol\n{a-z} : random lowercase letter\n{A-Z} : random uppercase letter\n{a-zA-Z} : random letter with random case (lowercase or uppercase)\n{0-9} : random number.\n\nAny other characters added without brackets { } will be included literally (fixed) in the password."
