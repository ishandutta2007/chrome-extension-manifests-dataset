This addon simply adds a small noise to the actual fingerprint and \"renews\" it every time you visit a website or reload a page. It is important to note that, it does not have any settings or options to adjust. Simply add it to your browser and start surfacing the internet. If you want to test this addon, please visit a website that shows your fingerprint (i.e. browserleaks). Every time you reload the page, you will see a new fake fingerprint.\n\nTo report bugs, please visit the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/canvas-defender.html) and fill out the bug report form."
