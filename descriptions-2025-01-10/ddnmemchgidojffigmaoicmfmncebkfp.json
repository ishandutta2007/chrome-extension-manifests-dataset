I created this extension to help you learn chess coordinates by announcing moves during your Chess.com games. It's also useful for players with visual impairments who benefit from audible notifications to follow along.\n\n\nFeatures\nMove Announcements: Hear every move to learn the coordinates.\nCastling Detection: Announces both kingside and queenside castling.\nPromotion Awareness: Informs you about pawn promotions and the promoted piece.\nEnglish Announcements: Uses a clear and pleasant female voice.\nRight now, it's hardcoded to English, but I'm open to adding more languages, voices, and features based on your feedback.\n\nRecently added:\nLanguage selelection: English, Spanish, French and Dutch!\nVoice previews\nVolume slider\nEnable/Disable button\n\nJust click on the extension button in the chrome dropdown for the settings overview.\n\n\nContact\nIf you have any ideas for new features or improvements, I'd love to hear from you! Please send your suggestions and feedback! I will do my best to respond.\n\nAlternatives:\nI tried multiple other announcer extensions, but they were either barely functional, or very crude in implementation, so I wrote this version. Hope it helps others as well!"
