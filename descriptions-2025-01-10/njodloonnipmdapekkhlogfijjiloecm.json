I bet you have considered using Chrome's bookmarks. But they don't work well for the enormous number of tabs you opened... While Chrome provides the option for bookmarking all tabs in a window, you cannot re-open all these tabs together with a single click (and the bookmarks will just pile up more quickly than you would like them to). Tab Drawer is designed to help you do just that.\n\nTab Drawer is a Chrome extension that helps you declutter your Chrome windows by saving tabs within a window so you can safely close windows that you are not currently using and restore them at any time."
