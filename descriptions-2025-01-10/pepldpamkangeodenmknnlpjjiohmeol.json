This extension works by reading the ui of a rule engine page. The Rule engine is a page containing a graph. Each node in the graph is a div. And the nodes are connected via connectors. What the extension does is read the ui, and then construct a graph in background. Then it takes a path of the graph as an input from the user. Then it highlights the path in the graph. This is a Beta version, which contains a feature to highlight the arrows in the pat as well. This feature works well, except for when the divs are really close by."
