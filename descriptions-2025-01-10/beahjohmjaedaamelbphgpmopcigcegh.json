You select which pranks to apply and how often they should be applied.  Change things up any time you have access to their machine.\n\nOther prank extensions are always on, so the pranks aren't very subtle.  This one allows you to adjust the frequency of each prank to make it as obvious or subtle as you like. Drive them crazy when they see a problem and refresh and don't see it again for a while.\n\nWe recommend installing on your own browser first and tweaking the settings to get a feel for how things act. Refresh the page you are on to see how things will work and what frequency you want to be use to be subtle or obvious.  Then install it on your victi.. err... friends browser and apply the settings you found to be appropriate."
