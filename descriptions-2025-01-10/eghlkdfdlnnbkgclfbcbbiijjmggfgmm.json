We are committed to protecting your privacy and using your data responsibly. The ads on our extension are delivered by our advertising partners, who may collect anonymized data in order to show you ads you'll be interested in.\n\nWe don't track the websites you visit or the content you view online. What you do online is you business and yours alone. Our extension's permissions allow us to replace ads online and detect if the website you are on is one of our partners. \n\n➤ We don’t plant trees\n\n☆ \"Planting trees is good. Saving existing forests is better.\" - Rainforest Trust ☆\n\nWe made an active decision to save existing trees rather than plant new ones because compelling studies show that planting trees won’t be enough to tackle climate change and that efforts on rainforest conservation lead to a more sustainable and lasting change.\n\nHere are three facts you might not know:\n\n✓ Forest conservation needs 30x less land to have the same climate mitigation outcome as planting trees.\n✓ Forest protection efforts help protect the natural habitat of thousands of species and local communities that depend on natural resources.\n✓ Forest conservation typically costs half as much as forest restoration efforts.\n\n➤ Tero vs. alternatives\n\n☆ Ecosia ☆\nWe love Ecosia! Although many people think we are competitors, we are actually not. We recommend you use Ecosia’s search engine with the Tero extension to maximise your impact.\n\n☆ OceanHero ☆\nLike Ecosia, OceanHero is a search engine that can also be used in Tero. It's a great combo to save both rainforests and oceans!\n\n☆ Tab for a Cause ☆\nThey are a great option if you want to support numerous charities, but they're only a new-tab page with limited functionalities.\n\n➤ Learn more\n\nAbout: https://www.jointero.org\nBlog: https://blog.jointero.org\nFAQs: https://blog.jointero.org/faq\nPrivacy: https://blog.jointero.org/privacy\n\nJoin us in Building a Greener Internet!\n\nNote: After installing, click the ‘Keep it’ button on the ‘Change back to Google’ notification. This will show Tero on each new tab as intended, and ensure the extension isn't disabled."
