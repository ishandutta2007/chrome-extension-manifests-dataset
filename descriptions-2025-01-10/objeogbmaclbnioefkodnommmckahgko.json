This may open many popup windows! We recommend you set a download directory in your browser settings instead.\n\n‚ùì FAQs\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\nüí≠ Why does this extension need access to all my site data?\nIn order to extract images from a web page, Image Downloader needs to be able to read all the content on that web page when you open the popup. No data leaves your computer. For more details check out our Privacy Policy: https://pactinteractive.github.io/image-downloader\n\nüí≠ Why did this extension download smaller images than I expected? Why did it miss some images?\nImage Downloader can only extract the images currently visible on the page. Those may sometimes be smaller thumbnails of the full-resolution images you'd expect to see when you click on a photo (e.g. in Facebook albums). In addition, some websites like Instagram have carousels with multiple images, but only load a few at a time to save bandwidth.\n\nWe're looking into adding such capabilities to Image Downloader in the future. If you need this kind of functionality right now, consider looking for an extension that downloads images from the specific website you're interested in (e.g. Facebook).\n\nüìù Change Log\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n3.4.0:\n- Add links to other projects in the Options page\n\n3.3.4:\n- Fix UI width broken by Chromium 116\n\n3.3.3:\n- Make BTC the only option to support the project\n\n3.3.2:\n- Disable slider handles when the checkbox is unchecked\n- Add tooltips to slider handles, slider checkboxes, and the Download button\n- Fix some issues with downloads not being cleaned up\n\n3.2.3:\n- Download in the background - you can now close the popup and the images will keep downloading!\n- Download single images into subfolder - previously they were saved into the browser's default directory\n- Improve background image detection\n\n3.1.1:\n- Fix images sometimes being saved outside the specified subfolder\n\n3.1.0:\n- Removed unnecessary images from styles\n- Made slider handles round and change cursor based on active state\n\n3.0.6:\n- \"Now with even more images!\" - find additional background images on the page\n- Allow forward and back slashes in subfolder and file paths\n- Bring back blue border around selected images\n- Show number of selected images\n\n3.0.5:\n- Fixed an issue with previewing images in Instagram (and other websites).
