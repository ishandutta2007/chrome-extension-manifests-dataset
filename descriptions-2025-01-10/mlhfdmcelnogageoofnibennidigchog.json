By clicking on the toolbar button, you can open Messenger in either a standalone UI or a configurable browser tab. The window is resizable to your preference, and all changes are automatically saved to memory. It's important to note that to use this extension, you must have a Facebook account.\n\nPlease be aware that \"Password Lock for Messenger™\" is not affiliated with or related to the official Facebook/Messenger website or application. It is an unofficial app developed and maintained independently. The official Messenger software is only released for smartphones and the web. This unofficial app (browser extension) acts as a wrapper for the original Messenger application, making it usable as a browser plug-in.\n\nThe extension offers an optional password protection feature that can be enabled or disabled from the right-click context menu over the toolbar button. When enabled, users must pass through password protection before using Messenger.\n\nAdditionally, you can change the opening mode from the stand-alone window to the browser tab and vice versa."
