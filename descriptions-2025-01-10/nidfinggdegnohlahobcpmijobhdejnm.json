These search results are advertisements because the content is locked behind a paywall.\n\nAfter performing a search it is possible to deselect the other sites manually, then the search results will not include any advertisements for network sites. However, browsing to a recipe and performing a *new* search will reset the selected sites requiring them to be deselected manually, *every single time a search is performed*.\n\nAs an example, the search query `bacon` has 40 results on the first page. Of these 40, only 15 results are for Cook's Illustrated Online. That means that **37% of results are valid** and **63% of results are advertisements**.\n\nBy default, when the form is submitted with a search term `bacon` the search results page will include results from:\n\n* `cio`, aka \"Cook's Illustrated Online\"\n* `cco`, aka \"Cook's Country Online\"\n* `atk`, aka \"America's Test Kitchen\"\n* `cookbook_collection`, aka \"Cookbook Collection\"\n* `school`, aka \"Cooking School\"\n\nIf you have not paid for subscriptions to all of these sites then the search results will be polluted with advertisements for these network sites.\n\nThis extension looks for the `atkGlobalSearch` form and modifies the `action` parameter to `/search?dFR[search_site_list][0]=cio&fR[search_cookbook_collection][0]=false`.\n\nThe search result page will then display results only from Cook's Illustrated Online.\n\nThe full MIT-licensed source code is available at https://github.com/anothermh/cies."
