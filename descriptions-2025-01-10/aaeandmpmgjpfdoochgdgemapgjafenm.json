This year, it falls on November 29th.\n\nThere are chapters in 80 countries with 260 communities worldwide and $2.7 billion was raised in 2021. World renowned supporters include the Gates Foundation. PayPal, Ford, Linkedin and the National Philanthropic Trust.\n\nGivingTuesday App\n\nGT App is a browser extension for charitable giving. Using triple-tap technology, it allows users to make micro-donations in the form of pennies via any website and social media post to a set charity.\n\nIt works for all countries and defaults to local currencies.\n\nDonation pledges are instant and recorded on a ledger inside the app.\n\nThe ability to pay off pledge tabs via ApplePay opens up on GivingTuesday.\n\nSettling pledges relies on the honor system, meaning it’s an obligation for those who are honest. However, it’s not mandatory for those who are not and there are no time limits or penalties for choosing not to."
