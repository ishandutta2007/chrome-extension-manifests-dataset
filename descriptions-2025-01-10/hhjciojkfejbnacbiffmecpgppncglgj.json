Do you wish to live a new life that is suited to your desires? The BitLife Life Simulator game will help you do that!\n\nIt's still a fun game, but now everything is locked behind a paywall. Even options that used to be free. Plus there are so many ads, I can't even click on something without an ad playing. I get it that ads is how you make money without having to have players and stuff, but everything is locked behind a price tag to the point where you're already making so much money.\n\nBitLife Life Simulator game introduction:\nBitLife is a life simulation game in which users take control of a stranger's life from beginning to end. It was released by Candy writer, a free app that, although not very famous on Google Play, has made a big impact on the gaming community. BITLIFE allows users to experience what would happen if they majored in acting or what they would do in their old age using a list of instructions, random events, and humor.\n\nThis game has simple gameplay, basically the same as other simulation games. However, in this game, you will choose actions for each character's time instead of choosing dialogue. For example, at the age of 18, you will choose a character to study a major in college or maybe even go to the army.\n\nCharacters in the game will have 4 basic stats including health, happiness, appearance, and intelligence. In my opinion, health is the most important factor because only when you have health can you do more things. You can improve your appearance with makeup, beautify yourself with clothes or accessories, or even get plastic surgery. Regarding IQ, you can increase it by going to school. Sometimes a wrong choice of yours can also terrify the police, but unfortunately in the process of catching criminals, you are attacked by them, and your life is over.\n\nHow to play BitLife game\nThe rules of the game are very simple, you just need to choose the actions that are appropriate for the age of the character. You can play it on a PC or mobile phone, very convenient!"
