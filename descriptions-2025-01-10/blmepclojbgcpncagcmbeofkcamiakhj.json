With many different city views' backgrounds, you will be inspired to schedule your day and life. You can easily access your created plan/schedule at any point by clicking the icon in your browser. You can delete completed posts, mark them as completed, make them back to incomplete by clicking the post, or keep them stored as completed. It provides an extremely convenient and simple way for you to manage your tasks. You can also use it as a to-do list to reminder yourself. \nOur idea is to make this app easy to use and hopefully let it inspire you. \n“Look at things as they can be, not as they are.” \n― David J. Schwartz, Magic of Thinking Big\nLet me know if you like it. \nAny feedback is welcome! Thank you : )"
