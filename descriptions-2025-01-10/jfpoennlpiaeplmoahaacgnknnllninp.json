The exchange rate API I used has been taken over by another company or made it paid to use sadly. No clue when I will update it once again. If you know of any good ones please let me know on discord JustDoom#1106\n\nTHIS IS IN DEVEX RATE NOT THE PURCHASE RATE\nDEVEX RATE IS $0.0035 USD PER ROBUX\n\nWant a quick easy way to find out how much money worth of robux you have? This extension will help!\n\nFeatures\n- Simple, easy settings!\n- Built in calculator!\n- Multiple currencies!\n- Works with group funds, gamepasses/clothing and your own balance!\n- Live currency rates!\n- And it's free!\n\nThis is my first ever chrome extension and I haven't done much with JavaScript so there might be some bugs/glitches :P\n\n1.2.3 Update Log\nFixed a bug where it wouldn't calculate group funds\nFixed update 1.2.1 because I forgot to replace the + symbol as well\n\n1.2.2 Update Log\nNext update for the extension with have a button that takes away 30% in the calculator so you know how much you gain when someone purchases a gamepass etc\n\n1.2.1 Update Log\nIf you have a ROBLOX balance that displayed as, 12K or 10M, for example (anything that has a letter in it) would break when calculating the worth and display as NaN. This is now fixed but if you have 10.5M but it displays as 10M it only calculates 10M and not that 0.5M, trying to fix this."
