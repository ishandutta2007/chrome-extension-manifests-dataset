PLEASE READ THIS !!!\n\nIf You're Stravaholic with HRM and/or other equipment (powermeter, cadence,...), You possibly don't know what You've been missing by not trying StraTistiX! It brings a lot deeper insight in Your workouts than Strava's default views.\n\nStraTistiX with aRPEe Score for Strava is my fork of Thomas Champagne's StravistiX Chrome Extension. It brings some additional goodies'n'tweaks based on my ideas and preferences; You might also like them, just try and see for yourself!\nIt's free and full source code is available on GITHub (https://github.com/KamensekD/StraTistiX)!\n\n\n_________________________________\nSome of best StraTistiX features:\n- detailed statistical analysis of your workout (heartrate, speed, cadence, grade, power) with interactive bar charts and customizable zones\n- works with most activity types (depending on available data)\n- most important analysis data displayed directly on Strava's activity page\n- TRIMP, Toughness Score and aRPEe Score* (numerical and descriptional estimation of how hard your workout was)\n- graphic aRPEe Zones (~TRIMP/hour) percent and minute distribution - nice visual overview of workout \"hardness\"\n- integrated Mapflipper button icons enable you to replace background maps with different OSM and Mapbox styles (also CUSTOM!)\n- slope/grade colored activity maps and profiles (with help of GPSVisualizer)\n- \"Return of\" Google Maps and Streetview after strava replaced it with Mapbox maps\n- links to some of best Strava-oriented sites (Veloviewer, Jonathan o'Keeffe,...)\n- export of anyone's segment effort as Virtual Partner (via SegmentBuilder)\n- \"in-table\" segment time comparisons to KOM's and PR's (Bikin' workouts only for now)\n- best splits (Bikin' workouts only for now)\n- Weather (Bikin' workouts only for now)\n- year progression (activity count, distance, elevation, time) table and chart\n- CSV export for easy custom analysis in spreadsheet\n* aRPEe Score concept was developed and designed by me. It's based on lots of my workouts and seems to describe how hard my workouts felt pretty accurately.\n___________\nDisclaimer: Anyone can freely take code from my repository and use it in non-commercial manner; when using _aRPEe Score_, please link to StraTistiX repository and/or extension; most kudos for the whole concept of this extension go to Thomas Champagne, so please also try his StravistiX!\nAs my free time allows me, I'll try to merge most interesting new stuff'n'bugfixes from Thomas's updates of his base repository into StraTistiX;\n\nDejan Kamen≈°ek, sLOVEnia\n\n\n_______________\nLatest updates:\n\n* release 0.6.0.1:  (based on StravistiX 0.6.0)\n- some bugfixes, tweaks and cosmetics\n- additional links to interesting Strava sites\n\n* release 0.6.0.2:\n- minor changes\n\n* release 0.6.0.3:\n- Added GPS Visualizer slope/grade colored map and colored profile\n- fix for heatmap (centering at your current location)\n- fix for activities without speed/move data\n- other minor changes\n\n* release 0.6.0.6:\n- MapFlipper updated to work with new maps and also added to segment and create segment pages\n- removed links not working anymore\n- other minor changes\n\n* release 0.6.1.0:\n- return of Google Maps - open activities and selected segments in Google Maps view with StreetView\n- added a lot of different Mapbox styles including (now customizable) user-defined Mapbox style\n\n* release 0.6.1.1:\n- Mapbox map flipper fixed after Strava's mapbox style change\n\n* release 2.0.0.1 (based on StravistiX 2.0.0):\nBIG UPDATE WITH LOTS OF GREAT NEW FEATURES :)\n- Added year progression (activity count, distance, elevation, time) table and chart\n- Added 'Best Splits' to biking activities\n- export of segments as Virtual Partner (cycling: button under segment compare)\n- Added segment builder link to segments page\n- Added biking segment time comparisons to KOM's and PR's\n- Added weather at activity date/time (wind/temp/clouds/humidity)\n- more analysis data (climbing time and speed, pedalling time,...)\n- Searchable common settings\n- Moved leftside buttons/links under Edit/Action buttons\n- Moved some leftside links to menu, reordered menu a bit\n- Various Fixes\nCredits for many of new features go to tomasz.terlecki / tazmanska !\n\n* release 2.2.2 (based on StravistiX 2.2.1):\n- statistics now computed on weighted percentiles\n  (might have big impact for activities with dynamic sampling period!)\n- heart rate extended statistics now computed based on moving time, not total time\n  (still not quite sure, which method is better... might decide to include both in future)\n\n- Added CSV export (for easy analysis in spreadsheet software)\n- Added Ascent speed statistics (VAM) for cycling\n- Improved 'Best Splits' - click on them to highlight the part of activity they represent!\n- Improved elevation data accuracy while computing extended statistics.\n  (Elevation data smoothed using low pass filter with gain matched to Strava's)\n- Added cadence, power and altitude data in overview table\n- Reordered and added some new data in extended statistics\n- Weather unis preferences\n- Various smaller additions and fixes, sorry for bigbug in 2.0.0.1 - settings menu not working :/\n\n* release 2.2.3 (based on StravistiX 2.2.1):\n- Quick Bugfix\n\n* release 2.3.0 (based on StravistiX 2.2.1):\n- NEW graphic aRPEe Zones (~TRIMP/hour) % and minute distribution!
