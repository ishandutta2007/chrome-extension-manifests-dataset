Yeah, painful, we know...\n\nSneakPeek provides a simple way to Peek and Preview links without opening the page. You can:\n• Trigger a Peek (by link hover + trigger key) to see the promo image, description, and the start of the page text.\n• Trigger a Preview (by link click + trigger key) to display the full page without navigating away from the current page. \n\nSneakPeek also packs some power-user features and settings. Just to name a few:\n• It's ready for video pages like YouTube or Vimeo, displaying the little preview of the video.\n• It's ready for PDF files.\n• It automatically detects and displays the best answer from the StackOverflow questions. \n• It let's you adjust the trigger-key to fit your specific flow. \n• It let's you adjust the preloading behaviour to fit your needs and internet connection. \n• It has a theme editing. \n\nGive it a go. You might love it!"
