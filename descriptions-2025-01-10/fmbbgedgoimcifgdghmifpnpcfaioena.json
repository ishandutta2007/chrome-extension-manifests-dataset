You can optionally have it switch automatically.\n\nHTTPS Finder is intended as a supplement to the EFF's HTTPS Everywhere extension which automatically switches you to HTTPS, but only for a known list of domains, whereas this extension automatically detects if a page is available on HTTPS.\n\nThe intention is to eventually allow the list of HTTPS-enabled sites that you have found to be submitted to the EFF for inclusion in the HTTPS Everywhere extension."
