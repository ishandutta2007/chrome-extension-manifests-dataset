Although these systems have achieved some success in tailoring content, users often desire a greater degree of control over their viewing experience.\n\nBy leveraging this extension, users can input their preferences in textual form, allowing the underlying OpenAI model to determine the relevance of the content displayed in their home feed. In cases where the content is deemed unrelated to the users' preferences, the extension aids in its removal.\n\nThis development is inspired by RecAlign."
