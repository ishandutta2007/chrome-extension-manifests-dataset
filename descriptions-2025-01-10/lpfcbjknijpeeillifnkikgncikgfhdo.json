It allows users to send and store multiple assets, delegate ada, and more.\n\nThe extension injects an API into every website's javascript context, so that arbitrary transactions can be built and signed.\n\nPrivate keys associated with users’ wallets are not stored on centrally hosted servers. They are stored only on the user’s computer and are encrypted with the wallet password.\n\nNami was created by Alessandro Konrad and is maintained by IOG.\n\nUseful links:\nhttps://namiwallet.io\nhttps://github.com/input-output-hk/nami-wallet\nhttps://iohk.io\nhttps://lace.io\n\nOffered by: IOG"
