Logging out helps. Inconveniently, fb does not let you click a checkbox to indicate that you do not want to stay logged in. You have to manually click on the log out button and even then you have the option to one-click-log-in.\n\nThis extension works around that by logging you out and removing one-click-log-in as soon as you close the tab. So you have to manually put in your username and password every time you come back."
