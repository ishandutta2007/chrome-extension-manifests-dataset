Once you have a lot of them, to search them efficiently, you need to organise them. But quickly, adapting the organisation becomes a chore in itself: redundant/obsolete tags, finding relevant bookmarks when splitting a tag for more precision... and without that, if you do not remember the exact wording for your search, you will have to read all of them one bby one.\n\nPinbot is an AI assistant taking care of all these needs. With one click, it generates a summary of the current page and suggests tags. You can add notes, search with synonyms, and everything runs offline: your privacy is guaranteed, thanks to your data never leaving your device."
