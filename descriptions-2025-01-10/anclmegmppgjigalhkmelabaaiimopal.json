It's best to start off with a lower duration for the sketch time then working up towards lengthier and more detailed sketches. However, feel free to use the tool however you like and what suits your needs best!\n\nFigure sketching involves capturing the human form focusing on proportions, anatomy, and the fluidity of poses. The best way to start is with numerous quick sketches to build an understanding of the subject's movement and essence. This approach helps artists develop their observational skills and hand-eye coordination, allowing them to depict the human figure more naturally and dynamically. Quick sketches encourage experimentation and reduce the pressure to create perfect drawings, fostering a more intuitive and spontaneous artistic process. By practicing this way, artists can achieve greater confidence and proficiency in their figure sketching abilities."
