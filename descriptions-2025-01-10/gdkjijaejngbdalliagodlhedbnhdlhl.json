The diff stats include the number of files changed, lines added, and lines deleted.\n\nThis extension currently supports github.com, gitlab.com and bitbucket.org. To activate the extension for any of these websites it's first required to provide the respective credentials in the extensions' options. These credentials aren't the same as the user's login credentials, instead they are personal access tokens that should be generated by the user with only the required set of permissions for the extension.\n\nThis extension does not collect any user data, and all credentials are stored locally in the browser's persistent storage.
