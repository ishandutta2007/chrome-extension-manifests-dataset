Become a 'Tourist', 'Alphabeteer', shout full-house in 'Stopwatch-Bingo' and many more! But why should runners have all the fun? Collect the purple volunteer badges too by helping out each week at parkrun, and level up by doing a role 5 times or more to gain stars.\n\nThis extension augments your athlete results page to include your progress towards the available challenges - and adds an extra badge below your name at the top when you have completed each one. You can also have a look how your friends are doing by browsing their profiles too.\n\nVisit https://running-challenges.co.uk for more information\n\nYou can set your home parkrun in the options (when you set your athlete number) to make the shortcut link go directly to your regional parkrun page (rather than it always linking to the .org.uk site), this will also give you extra map layers and stats!\n\nThis extension is not official or affiliated with parkrun in any way, it was created with love by keen parkrunners who just wanted to share the fun."
