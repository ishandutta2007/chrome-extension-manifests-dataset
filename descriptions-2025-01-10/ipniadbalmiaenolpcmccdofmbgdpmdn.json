Whether you’re conducting research, generating leads, or simply need to collect contact information, this extension makes it easy and efficient. Instead of manually scanning web pages, URL Email Extractor automates the process, saving you time and effort. With just a few clicks, you can quickly gather emails from multiple websites, making it ideal for marketers, researchers, and professionals in various fields.\n\nThe interface is user-friendly, featuring an input box where users can enter or paste URLs to scan. Additionally, there's an option to import URLs from a text file, which simplifies managing large lists. Once the URLs are loaded, click \"Extract Emails\" to initiate the scan. The extension then visits each site, identifies any visible email addresses, and presents them in a neatly organized table. If no email is found, the extension clearly indicates this, ensuring you don’t miss any important information.\n\nCustomization options include features like setting delay intervals between scans to ensure stable performance and the ability to exclude certain email patterns, such as generic addresses. For those needing more extensive capabilities, an \"Unlock PRO\" option is available. This feature enables unlimited extractions and access to premium functionalities, like exporting a CSV file of all extracted emails. PRO users can unlock the extension by entering a unique activation code, after which they’ll see a confirmation message that the tool is fully activated.\n\nThe extension is designed with convenience and flexibility in mind. A dedicated \"Clear\" button allows you to reset the URL list and results table, while the export functionality provides an easy way to save the collected data. Icons for the extension—optimized for various resolutions—are intuitive and stylish, ensuring a seamless experience."
