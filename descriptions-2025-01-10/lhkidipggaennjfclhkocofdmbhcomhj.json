A crime report or other news story is often accompanied by a Street View Screen shot of the location. The problem is that the user interface can make getting a 'clean' screenshot difficult.  Clean Street view is a small extension that removes the user interface elements so you can take better screenshots. It works by overriding the CSS code to 'hide' the elements.  \n\nThe original idea came from a post by UK Journalist and lecturer Karl Hodge. He identified the CSS elements on the page which are used in the plugin.  Note: Clean Street view doesn't remove the street names of direction arrows. These are baked into the image."
