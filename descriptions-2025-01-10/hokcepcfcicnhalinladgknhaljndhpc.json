For instance, if one navigates to `https://www.google.com`, Witchcraft will try to load and run `google.com.js` and `google.com.css`.\n\nWitchcraft also tries all domain levels. For instance, if one accesses `https://gist.github.com`, it will try to load, in this order: `com.js`, `github.com.js` and `gist.github.com.js`... and the same for CSS. All domain levels for which a script is found will be loaded, not just the first one.\n\nWhenever you edit or create new scripts, there's no need to reload anything other than the page where the scripts are supposed to run. This is what makes Witchcraft special and different than other popular scripting tools, like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey.\n\nSince Witchcraft runs as a Chrome extension, it is also cross-platform. It has been tested on Windows, MacOS and Linux.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* scripts are automatically updated after you edit them - no need to reload anything;\n* works on Windows, Mac and Linux;\n* handles both JS and CSS;\n* @include directive to load other JS/CSS files from inside your domain scripts.\n* custom server addresses (even remote ones)\n\nPlease check the website if you want to learn more."
