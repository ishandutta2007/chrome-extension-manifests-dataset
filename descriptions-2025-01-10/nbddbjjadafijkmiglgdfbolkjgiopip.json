Prices will be compared to over half a dozen other websites where you can potentially flip the book for a higher price.\n\nMany times you can buy a \"used\" textbook by a 3rd party seller on Amazon for a really low price.  Before you buy it, you can see if there are opportunities to buy low and sell high directly on Amazon.  In addition, you'll see if you can sell it for a better price on half a dozen other websites!\n\nTextrader does all of this automatically for you.  Just run the chrome extension and it will automatically pull back the Textbook listings and show how profit it to be made."
