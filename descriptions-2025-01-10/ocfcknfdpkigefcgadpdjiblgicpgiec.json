You can easily copy specific email addresses or export all of them to a text or CSV file.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nAutomation:Build a queue of up to 1,000 URLs that you want to visit. The tool will launch a robot that visits the requested pages and extracts all email addresses found on those webpages.\n\nAutoSave: This feature stores all email IDs found on the pages you visit in the cloud.\n\nThe plugin fetches email IDs from the source code, which means it can find hidden email IDs that may not be visible on the front end. For example, if a website shows 3 email IDs, the plugin might fetch more if there are hidden email IDs in the source code.\n\nFeatures:\nAutoVisit: Build a queue of URLs to visit automatically.\nAutomation: Discover all email IDs ending with a specific domain name.\nAutomatic Email Extraction: Extract email addresses from web pages.\nDownload Option: Download stored email IDs.\nAjax Page Extraction: Extract emails from Ajax pages, such as Google Search.\nDuplicate Filter: Filters duplicate email IDs to provide unique ones.\nExport Options: Export extracted emails to a text file.\n\nImportant Notes:\nExtracted IDs will be overwritten if you open a new tab and browse to a new page. To avoid this, switch to the previous tab to fetch and export the IDs. But every email address will be stored on cloud.\n\nInformal Disclaimer: \nThis extension is not intended for spamming people with marketing emails. Use it for personal purposes only."
