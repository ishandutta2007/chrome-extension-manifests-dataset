An extension by the maker of ChatGPT to Notion.\n\n💡 USAGE 💡\nOn Bard's page, you'll notice a new pin icon under each of its answers. You can use it to save specifically that answer and the related prompt to your Notion database of choice. If you want to save the whole discussion, you can do so from the extension popup.\n\nYou may link as many databases with the extension as you need to, and you can then choose which database to save your discussion to at saving time.\n\n✉️ CONTACT ✉️\nGot any suggestion/issue? Check out the extension's GitHub at https://github.com/L-a-r-t/bard-to-notion\nYou may also send me an email at tlartigau.pro@gmail.com :)\n\n🕵️ PRIVACY 🕵️\nFor security & practical reasons, some data such as your Notion user id and the key that allows us to communicate with your notion workspace (not your credentials, that no one except you has access to) are stored remotely instead of locally where they could be easily compromised. The code for this is open source and can be found on previously linked GitHub. Your data is never shared with any 3rd party.\n\nThe extension needs to access the following websites :\n\n- api.notion.com\n    \nThe saving process means that there is a back-and-forth between the extension and Notion’s API.\n    \n- bard.google.com\n\nThe extension needs to access Bard’s page to scrape the chat that you are saving.\n    \n- bard-to-notion.onrender.com\n    \nThis is the remote server where the access key is stored. The source corde for that remote server can be found on the extension’s GitHub.\n\nTake note that removing the extension’s access to your Notion workspace (Settings > My connections) will stop it from being able to access your workspace as long as you don’t reinstall it and redo the authentification process.\n    \n- theo-lartigau.notion.site\n    \nAs part of the Notion authentification process, you are redirected on a webpage chosen by the Notion integration’s maker. Notion’s API response is url-encoded which means that the extension needs to access the redirect page to fetch it. In the case of this extension, that redirect page is the following : https://theo-lartigau.notion.site/Bard-to-Notion-f0dfe63e7dee485e8d2d7aa5a1102388\n\n\nTHIS EXTENSION IS DEVELOPED INDEPENDENTLY AND IS NOT AFFILIATED TO EITHER GOOGLE OR NOTION"
