As well as give it a unique name. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use: \n\nTo use YoutubeColor, simply click on the palette icon in the top right hand corner to display a pop-up window where you can change the color scheme of YouTube to \"Deafult\", \"Dark\" or a custom theme, once one has been made . \n\n\nMake custom theme: \n\nTo make a custom theme, click on the \"Create a theme\"  option in the extensions pop-up window.

There are 6 different elements that you can change (elements listed above), each one has a text box displaying the current color and the HEX color code for that element. \n\nTo change the colors just click on the text box and a full range color-picker will appear where you can set the color to you desire. \n\nOnce you have chosen a color for all 6 elements there will be another text box at the bottom where you can give the theme a custom name. \n\nLastly,  once you have chosen your colors and given the theme a name, click the \"Save\" button to save your new custom theme.
