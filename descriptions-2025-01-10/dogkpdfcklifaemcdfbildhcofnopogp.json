This extension only requires these permissions to allow viewing of prototypes in Chrome - Axure does not track or access any of your information.\n\nIMPORTANT: After installing the extension you must check the setting \"Allow access to file URLs\". You can access this by going to: Tools > Extensions > Axure RP Extension for Chrome from the Chrome > Preferences menu.\n\nThis extension allows you to view Axure RP prototypes in Google Chrome. It is not used to open Axure RP project files (.rp, .rpteam) for editing in Google Chrome.\n\nYou do not have to install this extension if you want to view prototypes hosted on the web. For example, you don't need this to view prototypes from Axure Cloud (app.axure.cloud) or Axure Cloud for Business (axure.com/enterprise). \n\nIf you have any issues or questions, please email support@axure.com To download the latest version of Axure RP or a free 30-day trial, visit axure.com/download."
