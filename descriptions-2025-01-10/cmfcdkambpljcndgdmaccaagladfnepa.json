Never again will you have to see stuttering gifs that start playing before being fully downloaded.  And you will no longer have to wait until a gif loops to see the beginning.\n\n0.1.1\n- Fix issue with gif urls not showing gif and prevent fetching of 'undefined' images.\n\n0.1.0\n- display gif's total size while loading when available\n\n0.0.9\n- fix bug preventing standalone gifs from ever loading\n\n0.0.8\n- fix bug overriding default gif styling on certain websites\n\n0.0.7\n- fix bug preventing gifs from loading on Wolfram Alpha\n\n0.0.6\n- more efficient loading hooks\n- remove cruft from package (moving common code to submodule for FF/Safari releases)\n\n0.0.5\n- added css spinner to loading text\n- remove absolute positioning from loading text\n\n0.0.4\n- show gif if any errors\n- clean up code\n- log messages to console\n- use all_urls for injection matching\n\n0.0.3\n - Tracks loaded and loading gifs to reduce duplicate resource requests if gif already cached for the page\n - Should not hide buttons in GMail - not working 100%, sometimes navigation buttons still hidden until you hover them, or scroll the page\n\n0.0.2\n - Handle gifs added to the DOM after initial load properly.\n - Works with Hover Zoom"
