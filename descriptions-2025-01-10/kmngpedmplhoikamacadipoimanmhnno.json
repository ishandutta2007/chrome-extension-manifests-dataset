APR\" column (APR stands for annual profit rate).\nNow you will be able to see at a glance which pools are worth your time.\n\nJust install the extension and the column will appear.\n\nIn the future, other UX improvement may be incorporated into the extension.\nCheckout the source code at https://github.com/maxandron/unihelper \n\n## APR Calculation\n\nThe estimation is based on the last 7 days, by using the data already inside the\ntable and just running the calculation.\n\nThe calculation formula is roughly:\n`apr = (((weeklyVolume * fees) / tvl) / 7) * 365`\n\nThis is a rough approximation of the **minimum** APR based only on the last\nseven days.\n\nThe actual APR will be different because:\n\n* It will be affected by the price range you choose\n* It will be affected by the changes in volume\n* It will be affected by the changes in TVL\n* By the amount of money you stake relative to the TVL\n\n## Caveats\n\nThe data to calculate the APR is taken from the table itself.\nThat means that if Uniswap shows incorrect data, the APR will be calculated\nincorrectly as well."
