It adds download button on all media of web version of Instagram.\n\nUsing this extension, you can download photos and videos from your feed, from your friend's profile, or from your own profile with one click. You can download reels, stories, and even whole carousel posts.\n\nEasy Saver creates \"easy-saver-folder\" in your Download folder. All videos and photos will be saved in subfolders like this: \"%Downloads_folder%\\easy-saver-folder\\%friends_username%\\\", so it will be very easy to sort photos from different accounts.\n\nAfter the download is finished download button will blink green, if it was successful, or red if it wasn't. (usually because it's a private video or because you cancel the download yourself)\n\nNew featureðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥: now you can record Instagrams live stream which is currently online. Open streams page, find record panel, click \"Start recording\" button. That's it. The stream will be recorded and saved automatically at the end. Or you can click \"Stop and save\" button and currently recorded part of a live stream will be saved right away. While the stream is being recorded you can minimize the recording panel and continue to browse the Instagram. Yes, you can leave live stream page and browse your feed, stream will be recorded anyway (But don't reload Instagram page with browser reload button, it would stop the recording. Basically, if you see a recording panel then the stream is being recorded) You can record ðŸ”¥several streams simultaneouslyðŸ”¥ in one tab. Just open the other stream you want to record and another record panel will be added. At the end of the stream you will receive two files: one with video .m4v, one with audio .m4a. Extension can't merge these files by itself, but you can use video player (VLC for example) to open video and add an audio track. Or you can use \"ffmpeg\" program to merge these files into one video file (I prefer this way) Or you can find some online service to merge it, it's up to you.\n\nNote, that if you want Chrome to automatically download photos, you need 'Ask where to save each file before downloading' option to be turned off, otherwise it will ask you where to save every single photo. It's not bad, but it's not as convenient as originally intended.\n\nAnd don't forget, that all videos and photos belong to their creators. Don't download it without the owner's permission."
