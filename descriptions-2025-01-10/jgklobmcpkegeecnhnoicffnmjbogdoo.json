This is why we built BuildReal which is: \n\n> an automated daily Twitter prompt \n> designed to extract your best thinking\n> in a low-distraction channel\n\nUsers agree that these attributes of BuildReal lead them to publishing MORE frequently, with AUTHENTIC content in LESS time. Post quickly, then get back to building. \n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n1. Clean automated daily Twitter prompt and 280-character textbox\n2. Disappearing prompt after 60 minutes (to inspire authentic ‘in-the moment’ content and limit ‘over-thinking’)\n3. Hassle-free Twitter publishing (no need to log-on to Twitter)\n4. Auto tagging as part of the ‘BuildReal’ community"
