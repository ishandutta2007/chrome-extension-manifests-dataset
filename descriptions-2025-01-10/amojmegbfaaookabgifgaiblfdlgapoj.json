Each of these links corresponds to a person on the page you're on. Click on a link to start following that person. This changes the order of the pages, so that they are shown from that character's point of view.\n\nIn case you didn't guess: Here be spoilers! Lots and lots of spoilers.\n\n---- Features ----\n\nBeyond the scope of just changing the page links, this extension also has other features, which you can enable/disable through the options page.\n\nYou can find the options page by clicking on the \"POV Cam Options\" link, that appears beneath the links on each page.\n\nThese features are designed to make it easier to read Homestuck:\n\n==> Enable/Disable groups of timelines\n    Choose which timelines you wish to be able to follow.\n\n==> Auto-open pesterlogs\n    Have the pesterlogs open when the page loads, to prevent the tedium of clicking on a button every time.\n\n==> Arrow key navigation\n    Use the left and right arrow keys to go back and forward pages, to save having to click on a link.\n\n==> Highlighting Doc Scratch's text\n    Give white text a green background, to make it easier to read.\n\n==> Lord English's links\n    Don't like the flashing of Lord English's links? Then use this one to turn it off.\n\n==> View pre-retcon pages\n    Show the pages as they looked before the various retcons\n\n==> Flash page controls (most flashes)\n    Have a slide bar and pause button to control where in a flash animation you are.\n\nAfter changing your settings, refresh any open Homestuck pages for the changes to take effect.\n\n---- Timeline data ----\n\nThis extension currently has timeline data (starting at page p=00xxxx, thanks to ravenfire40 for this suggestion) for:\n\n==> The beta kids:\n    ==> John (3790) and a doomed John (3538)\n    ==> Rose (3790) and a doomed Rose\n    ==> Dave (3790), Davesprite (3541) and two (4963) other (4989) doomed Daves\n    ==> Jade (3790) and Jadesprite (5112)\n\n==> Their sprites:\n    ==> Nannasprite (2184)\n    ==> Jaspersprite (3049)\n    ==> Calsprite (3541) and Davesprite (3541)\n    ==> Jadesprite (5112)\n\n==> Their guardians:\n    ==> Dad (3766) and Nanna (3787)\n    ==> Mom (3787)\n    ==> Bro (3787) and Lil' Cal (5931)\n    ==> Grandpa (3787) and Becquerel (3840)\n\n==> Their exiles:\n    ==> WV (3700)\n    ==> PM (2933)\n    ==> AR (3355)\n    ==> WQ (3512)\n\n==> The B1 agents of Derse\n    ==> Jack Noir (2790)\n    ==> Draconian Dignitary (3432)\n    ==> Hegemonic Brute (2857)\n    ==> Courtyard Droll (3681)\n\n==> The Midnight Crew\n    ==> Spades Slick (4198)\n    ==> Diamonds Droog (4478)\n    ==> Hearts Boxcars (4448)\n    ==> Clubs Deuce (4207)\n\n==> The Felt\n    ==> Itchy (7839)\n    ==> Doze (7839)\n    ==> Trace (7846)\n    ==> Clover (7846)\n    ==> Fin (7922)\n    ==> Die (7922)\n    ==> Crowbar (7922)\n    ==> Snowman (4207)\n    ==> Stitch (7965)\n    ==> Sawbuck (7965)\n    ==> Matchsticks (7965)\n    ==> Eggs (8011)\n    ==> Biscuits (8011)\n    ==> Quarters (8092)\n    ==> Cans (8092)\n    ==> Various alternate versions, due to timeline shenanigans\n    ==> Doc Scratch (5513)\n    ==> Lord English (6011)\n\n==> The beta trolls:\n    ==> Aradia (5479) and a doomed Aradiabot (5477)\n    ==> Tavros (4067)\n    ==> Sollux (5490)\n    ==> Karkat (4077)\n    ==> Nepeta (3955)\n    ==> Kanaya (5220)\n    ==> Terezi (4138)\n    ==> Vriska (5374)\n    ==> Equius (4079)\n    ==> Gamzee (3910)\n    ==> Eridan (3966)\n    ==> Feferi (4080) and doomed Feferi (6589)\n\n==> Their ancestors:\n    ==> The Condesce (5970)\n\n==> The alpha kids:\n    ==> Jane (6013)\n    ==> Roxy (6055)\n    ==> Dirk (6865)\n    ==> Jake (6019)\n\n==> Their sprites:\n    ==> Tavrisprite (6734)\n    ==> Tavrosprite (9349)\n    ==> Fefetasprite (7419)\n    ==> Rosesprite (9404)\n    ==> Jasprosesprite^2 (9490)\n    ==> ARquiusprite (7547)\n    ==> Erisolsprite (7412)\n    ==> Nepetasprite (9720)\n    ==> Davepetasprite^2 (9778)\n\n==> Their agents:\n    ==> Jack Noir (6294)\n\n==> The alpha trolls:\n    ==> Damara (6892)\n    ==> Rufioh (6892)\n    ==> Mituna (6892)\n    ==> Kankri (6892)\n    ==> Meulin (6892)\n    ==> Porrim (6892)\n    ==> Latula (6892)\n    ==> Aranea (6480)\n    ==> Horuss (6892)\n    ==> Kurloz (6892)\n    ==> Cronus (6892)\n    ==> Meenah (6537)\n\n==> The cherubs:\n    ==> Calliope (7874)\n    ==> Caliborn (7874)"
