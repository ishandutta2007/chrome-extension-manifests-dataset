Streaming music services, however, continue playing indefinitely. Lullaby let's users control how long their music plays, pausing their stream after they've drifted off to dreamland.\n\nCurrently supports:\n- 8tracks\n- Google Music\n- Grooveshark\n- Pandora\n- Rdio\n- Songza\n\nTo enable the sleep timer, click the Lullaby icon in the omnibar and select a timeout length. Lullaby will warn you five minutes before the player is paused.\n\nIf you would like to request or add support for another service, please visit the Github page:\nhttps://github.com/runkalicious/lullaby/issues"
