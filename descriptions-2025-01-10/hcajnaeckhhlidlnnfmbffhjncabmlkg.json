If you ever want to see new announcements that moderators pushed through the sidebar, want to submit something, or simply have the sidebar visible, just click the button again and the sidebar will re-appear as if nothing happened.\n\nBy default, the current version disables the button when the sidebar is not taking up too much screen space. However, this setting can be toggled from the \"RSTB\" tab usually found at the top of the Reddit so that it is on at all times.\n\nThis extension also works with RES!\n\nAll source code for the extension can be found at https://github.com/tacowhisperer/RSTB"
