The EPA has provided data that estimates the carbon footprint per dollar of manufacturing cost for different categories of products; some categories include toys, shoes, clothes, and computers. Clove currently has over 40 different categories of products, and each Amazon product will be matched to the closest category, and calculations will be based on the closest category. Amazon also provided a 2020 report with estimates of their carbon footprint per dollar spent on their website. Based on the data provided by the EPA and by Amazon, we created formulas for each product category and used those formulas to calculate the carbon footprint. \n\nDonations:\n\n-Every month we automatically collect donations based on your carbon emission through Stripe. \n\n-Select a charity and you are good to go!\n\n-Your carbon offset donations will be tracked and available in your clove dashboard: https://dashboard.joinclove.org/pages-sign-in.html\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nOur calculations are an estimate, and carbon footprints of products may vary based on location and quality of manufacturing and methods of delivery. We are working to create more specific product categories, so that our carbon footprint estimates are more exact."
