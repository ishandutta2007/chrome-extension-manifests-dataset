Turtlo also sometimes does some stuff when he is bored - like walking around, spinning around and generally being very cute.\n\nOf course, Turtlo respects the fact that there may be some website where you don't need a turtle crawling around. That's why you can enable/disable Turtlo on websites individually!\n\nTurtlo single use is to make the web a happier place. With Turtlo, every boring website becomes fun!
