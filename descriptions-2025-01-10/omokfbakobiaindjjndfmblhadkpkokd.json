With its ability to mimic human writing, it can be difficult to determine whether a piece of text was written by an AI or a human.\n\nThis Chrome extension makes it easy to detect any text that has been written or altered by GPT-3. Simply enter at least 50 characters of the given text and click submit. The extension will use the huggingface.co/openai-detector API to tell you the probability that your text extract was written by an AI.\n\nTo get started, simply install the extension and try submitting this description text to see if it has been altered by GPT-3."
