However 5 days after learning the solution they completely forget what they learnt. It has nothing to do with the users memory but the fact that the problem wasn't reviewed again to make it permanent in the memory. \n\nUsers also fail coding interviews because they face the same problem in coding interviews. They had solved several problems but they were not able to retain or remember the logic clearly as the knowledge and algorithms got dusty. \n\nSo here is an extension to keep that knowledge sparkling forever.\n\nLong term retention happens when we revisit those problems at regular intervals of time so that they get fixated in the memory.\n\nThis idea is explained by an algorithm called Spaced Repetition which has been implemented in this extension with a fair deal of flexibility where the user can select the repetition timeframe of the problem to be reviewed and the extension will show a comprehensive list of problems to be reviewed each day.\n\nIf you are fairly new to problem solving, coding, interview preparation this extension is what you need to crack those coding interviews and get that dream job as it will enhance your memory and with that when asked similar questions in the interview you would be able to recollect and devise the appropriate solution quickly. Several people also ask how to leetcode properly so this also helps with staying in a rhythm of problem solving and also gives a sense of satisfaction.\n\nIf you like this extension leave a rating :)\nGood luck on your coding interview preparation."
