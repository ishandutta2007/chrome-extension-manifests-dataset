In both cases tMt will locate and bring you to the closest match and will indicate how close a match the found text is to the desired text.  No longer do you need to try and find text that Google is suggesting is in the article but isn’t.  If no close match can be found tMt will leave you at the top of the target website. \n\ntMt improves the efficiency of locating specific information identified by Google searches.\n\ntMt works within Chrome as well as the Chromium version of MSFT’s Edge web browser version 80 and later.\n\nExperience an issue, please email us at Feedback.spfll@gmail.com.  In the email, describe what the issue is and if possible, Include the URL of your Google search from the URL address bar and a screenshot of the issue you experienced. Also feel free to forward any suggestions you may have as to how tMt can be improved."
