Your to-do list, reading list you want to go through this weekend, your grocery list, code snippets and whatnot(e).\n\nðŸ‘‰ Why another note-taking app?\nLet's face it, we really don't need a full-fledged note-taking app to jot down our random and un-organised thoughts. This needs a simple, fast and easy to access platform where you can have your cluttered, random and fragmented jotting really quick. And a browser-tab is the fastest, easiest and most accessible platorm to use.\n\nFeatures:\n- Zero learning curve note-taking\n- Support of Bold, Italics, Strike, Bullet Points, Link and Code Block\n- Tag your note\n- Pin your note to access them faster"
