Utilizing a Chrome extension, Brahma Connect integrates dApps within an iframe, allowing users to securely interact with multiple dApps at once from their Brahma Console's Safe wallet.\n \nThis capability is powered by a suite of forked nodes, which facilitate the propagation of dApp states through a simulation mode, enhancing security and user experience. Brahma connect works specifically in tandem with Brahma Console and its execution stack, as its primary dApp connection method. Users can build sequences of actions across dApps in a single session, and batch them all in a single transaction. This enables user to save time, gas and have better control on their strategies being executed in a single transaction and block. \n\nKey Features\n- Chained Execution: Facilitates the sequential execution of transactions across different dApps, reducing the complexity and time required for multi-step operations.\n- IFrame Integration: securely embeds dApps within an iframe, upholding the dApp's integrity, while the extension intercepts transactions and synchronizes the dApp's state using forked nodes, facilitating efficient transaction batching.\n\nSecurity Assumptions\nBrahma Connect is built with a strong emphasis on security, notably eliminating the need for private key management directly within the extension. The framework ensures that users maintain full control over their assets without exposing sensitive information. Brahma Connect enhances security through a forked node that communicates with dApps via extensions using the chrome runtime, enabling users to preview and simulate transactions safely before confirming and sending them.\n\nUsing Brahma Connect\n1. Once the extension is installed, head to your Brahma Console at the usual link https://console.brahma.fi/\n2. You will see a new tab in the menu sidebar called \"Brahma Connect\"\n3. Now you can search and load any dApp URL directly in your Console and leverage the Console stack with transaction chaining, simulation and relayer for best execution"
