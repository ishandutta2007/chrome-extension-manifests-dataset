In addition to the things you consciously post for your friends to see, Facebook also tracks your *behavior* - what you search for and what you click on. Facebook uses this data to piece together a picture of who you are.\n\nIf you're kind of creeped out by this, but also don't want to boycott Facebook entirely - Noisify is for you! This extension regularly updates the placeholder text in your Facebook search bar. It nudges you to add noise to your \"digital footprints\" by searching for random interests and names.\n\nMaybe you'll find something random and delightful! Or, maybe you'll start getting weirder ads.\n\nThis is an art project from the BuzzFeed Open Lab. Code: https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/noisify"
