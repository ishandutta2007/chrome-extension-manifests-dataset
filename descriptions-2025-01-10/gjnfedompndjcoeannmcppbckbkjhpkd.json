That's another cool use case.\n\nFeeds are public so anyone can publish to any feeds. \nBe aware of that before using it for sensible URLs.\n\nBut, instead of using the public server (rsstodolist.eu), you can also deploy the app on your own server (https://github.com/paulgreg/rsstodolist-node-server) and configure the extension to use that endpoint to have maximum privacy and security.\n\nCheck https://rsstodolist.eu/ for further details.\nApplication and extension are open source."
