By obfuscating learner details, this extension provides a more neutral grading environment, ensuring more fair and unbiased assessments and evaluations.\n\nWhile Brightspace includes an Anonymous Marking feature, it is irreversible once a submission has been received. This plugin provides a non-destructive, reversible anonymization that can be toggled at any time.\n\nIt is common for learners to use their name as part of their submission's file name. If this is a concern, notify students that their submitted files must not include their name."
