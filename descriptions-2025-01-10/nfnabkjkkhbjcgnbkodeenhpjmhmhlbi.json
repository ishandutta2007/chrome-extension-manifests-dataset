If you are working on a long-term project and need to repeatedly open the same links, the extension can save these URLs, so you don’t have to input them again.\n✅ Save URLs for Later: Preserve your list of URLs for future use.\n✅ Keep Settings Consistent: Save your chosen settings (random order, duplicate removal, etc.) for repeated use.\n\n⚡ Use Cases for All URLs Opener\nThe All URLs Opener has a variety of use cases for different professionals and users:\n✅ Research: Open multiple research papers, articles, or data sources at once to compare and contrast information efficiently.\n✅ Marketing Campaigns: Open multiple landing pages, analytics reports, or competitor sites in one go.\n✅ SEO Analysis: For SEO experts, quickly open multiple backlinks, competitor websites, or keyword research tools.\n✅ Web Development: Open multiple development environments, live websites, or test servers simultaneously.\n✅ Social Media Management: Open multiple social media profiles, dashboards, or post schedules in a few clicks."
