Fixes some issues experienced with the script.\n\nThis extension gives you the ability to customise the AWS Console navigation bar, to indicate what account you are currently signed in as.\nIn addition, it will make the name of the AWS Region you are using, and the Account Name visible by default on the Navigation bar\n\nPreviously when you used \"Switch Roles\" you could set a colour when changing from one account to another. However, when switching to AWS SSO (or now know as IAM Identity Center), you do not have this ability with the Console.\n\nA Simple dialog lets you configure each account/account alias and the relevant colour you want to have, and this will be auto applied on the console page loading.\n\n See screenshots for some examples!"
