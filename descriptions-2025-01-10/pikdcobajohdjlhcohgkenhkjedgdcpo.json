Initially geared towards those with dyslexia, this extension decreases reading time for all users.\n\nThe extension can be activated by clicking it's icon in the top right corner of your browser (indicated by a \"1\"), and deactivated by clicking it again (indicated by a \"0\"). Be wary that in version 1.0, the extension simply reloads your webpage to deactivate the highlighting, so be sure to back up content in progress."
