It requires inserting the server endpoint for the self-hosted server. You also need to choose which tools you wish to enable. You have the ability to tune the generation paramaters from the plugin's popup.\n\nUsage:\nThese are the tools that are currently available:\n\nAuto-complete: Press `Alt+C` to trigger the auto-complete tool.\n\nAuto-complete Selection: Select a text and press `Alt+Shift+C` to trigger the auto-complete tool. The selected text will be used as the prompt.\n\nIssues:\nIf nothing happens when you use the plugin, verify that the plugin's shortcuts are not in conflict with other plugins' shortcuts [here](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).\n\nIf you encounter any problem/question, please open an issue in the project's repository.\n\n## Privacy\nThe plugin saves its configuration locally on the users' computer. The plugin's authors do not collect any data from the plugin's users."
