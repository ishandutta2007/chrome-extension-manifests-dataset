You can store it on a sticky note near your computer, on the wall in a frame as a picture, or just however you want.\n\n1. enter your passphrase\n2. enter what the password is for (for example, for Amazon it could be https://www.amazon.com/ or just amazon, or anything that will make you understand that the generated password will be used for the desired resource )\n3. generate a password and use it to register or change your password.\n\nThat's all, you no longer need to remember your password, you can get it at any time, knowing your passphrase and the name of the desired resource, simply by repeating all the steps\n\nPasswords (actually not passwords at all, but encrypted data) are so complex that only the great-grandchildren of the great-grandchildren of the hacker who started hacking them can crack them\n\nIn general, I did it just for myself"
