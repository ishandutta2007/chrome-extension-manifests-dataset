Some job postings will need more information. JobGenie saves those postings & the information that was needed then asks you the next time you open your account so it can save your answer for any other application that needs that information.\n8. Click save changes.\n9.Re-Apply: JobGenie will apply to all of the postings that required the additional information.\n10.Repeat Step 5 & 9 as often as you want until you find a job.\n\nAdditional features:\n\nWe think your chances of getting interviews should increase with each application you send. JobGenie counts how many jobs you apply to and when it hits 100 we will send your resume and information to recruiters.\n\nWe also think you should be able to make a little money while you search for a job. When you download the extension, you become an affiliate marketer and receive $5 for every person you refer.\n\nOther things to know:\nYou need a LinkedIn account.\nIt works better for different positions based on openings available in desired locations. \nEveryone gets a free day to see if this is for you. You can still earn money if you donâ€™t pay.\nSoftware Engineers, Data Analysts/Scientist, Marketing positions, Product Owners/Managers, and tech positions tend to have the most openings.\nWe HIGHLY recommend setting the location to remote. It will apply you to the most jobs and find opportunities you'd never come across on your own.\n\nOur goal is to build a product that helps speed up the job search. Your feedback will help us do that. This is just the first version so as you provided feedback, bugs will be fixed and features will be added to help as much as possible."
