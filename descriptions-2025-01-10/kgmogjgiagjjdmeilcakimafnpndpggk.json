I wrote this extension for my own use, and am sharing it in case anyone finds it useful.\n\nInstructions\n==========\n1) create a folder named \"mCoffee\". If you have multiple folders with the same name, It will only process the first one found. If the bookmark folder \"mCoffee\" is not found, the icon will turn red. Clicking on the extension will then launch a new tab to https://sites.google.com/view/extension-mcoffee/home.\n\n2) Under the \"mCoffee\" folder, you can create the following subfolders (create only folders that you use, i.e. you don't need to create \"Tue\" if you don't have Tuesday specific items to launch)\n   i) Daily\n   ii) Mon / Tue / Wed / Thu / Fri / Sat / Sun\n   iii) 1 - 31\n      - place items for a specific day of the month here. For example, items in the folder \"1\" will be launched on the first day of the month (e.g. you want to check your bank statement every 1st day of the month).\n   iv) Weekday\n      - items that you want to launch from Mon - Fri\n   v) Weekend\n      - items that you want to launch on Sat, Sun\n   vi) Autostart\n        - items here will be launched when the extension is loaded\n   vii) Rules\n      - set conditions for launching items\n      - more advanced options can be set for bookmarks in the Rules folder, for example time blocks, tabGroups\n      - add the conditions as a comma separated list inside square brackets in the item's title, e.g. \"Testing [2,Mon,Wed]\" to launch the item \"Testing\" on the 2nd of the month, Mondays and Wednesdays\n\nPlease refer to https://sites.google.com/view/extension-mcoffee/home for more examples on how to configure and use this extension.\n\nNotes\n=====\nThis is a very basic extension, everything is managed using the bookmark manager. \n\nThe extension checks if the URL is already opened in an existing tab, if so it won't launch a duplicate tab. Note that some sites automatically expands / redirect the base url. For example, if you launched https://mail.google.com the opened url will be https://mail.google.com/mail/. If you click on the extension icon again, it will open another tab for Gmail because \"https://mail.google.com\" doesn't match \"https://mail.google.com/mail/\".\n\nDisclaimer\n==========\nTHIS EXTENSION IS PROVIDED IN GOOD FAITH, HOWEVER I MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY, VALIDITY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, FUNCTIONALITY\nOR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION ON THE EXTENSION.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL I HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THIS EXTENSION.\n\nYOUR USE OF THE EXTENSION IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\nPrivacy notice\n==============\nThis extension does not collect any data.\n\nHistory\n=======\n2023-05-13: version 1.5.5\n    - tweaked extension icon to have more contrast for darker themes\n    - at least 3 seconds between each execution to ignore accidental double clicks\n2022-08-16: version 1.5.4.1\n    - TabGroups should now reliably move to start of tab bar\n2022-06-30: version 1.5.4\n      - TabGroup support.
