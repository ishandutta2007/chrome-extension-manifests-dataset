You're reading some random README file of this cool library you want to try out, and there are a ton of snippets, one after another after another that each requires a copy and paste, to either execute a command on the terminal or add content to a file. And that copying process usually requires an agonizing use of the trackpad or mouse to copy exactly what you need. And if you overshoot or undershoot that drag motion, you have to start all over again!\n\nFortunately, that era of madness is now over with this Chrome extension. `snippet-copier-shortcut` will do the heavy lifting for you by providing contextually relevant keyboard shortcuts depending on which snippets are currently within the window's view, thanks to the [InteractionObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).\n\nThis extension currently only works with web pages on Github, but will soon evolve to support a variety of other sites.\n\nSource available on Github: https://github.com/PatNeedham/snippet-copier-shortcut"
