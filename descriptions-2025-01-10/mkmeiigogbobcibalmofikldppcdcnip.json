Instead, forcibly installing this extension via a policy will enable DNT by force.\n\n\nCAVEATS\n\nIt's possible for any other installed extension to override this one (potentially altering the DNT setting). This can be mitigated by white listing extensions.\n\n\nGITHUB SOURCE\n\nThis extension is extremely simple (as it should be).
