It supports three primary conversion types:\n\n• Unicode-String Converter: Convert any string into its Unicode representation and vice versa. This is particularly useful for developers working with internationalization and localization.\n• ASCII-Char Converter: Convert individual ASCII codes to their corresponding characters and the other way around. This is beneficial for understanding the ASCII values of specific symbols or characters.\n• ASCII-String Converter: Transform an entire string into its ASCII code equivalent and back. This feature is essential for data serialization and other encoding-related tasks.\n\nThe extension's interface is designed for ease of use, featuring input fields, buttons, and output areas that are intuitively organized. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a student, or someone who just needs to convert text for whatever reason, this tool provides a quick, reliable way to perform these conversions."
