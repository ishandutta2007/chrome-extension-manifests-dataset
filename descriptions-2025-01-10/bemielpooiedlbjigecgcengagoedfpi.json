E.g., a scratch or developer org looks very similar to a production org. \nMiljö helps you tell them apart by giving them different names, colours, and icons. There are some extra goodies added as well.\n\nMain Features\n- Name the org, create a badge next to the app name in your org\n- Assign an org colour that is used for the badge, favicon, login page, and production banner\n- Add a favicon, using slds utility icons\n- Warnings banner for production orgs\n\nAdditional Features\n- Login window\n    - Expand the login window to display the full username\n    - The org colour as the background\n- Print org type at the top of the screen\n- Works in both Classic and Lightning Experience\n\nHow it works\n1. Click on the icon when you are at one of your Salesforce org to open the settings\n2. Enter a Name and select the colour and icon\n3. Save to apply the change\n\nTroubleshooting\nThe plugin icon does not appear in the toolbar.\nYou might need to pin the plugin to have easier access. Click on chrome's extension icon (puzzle piece). Then, click on the pin icon next to Miljo.\n\nThanks to\nSLDS design resources\nBeautiful photos from Unsplash by @micaelwidell and @raphaeldas"
