Perhaps you don't like the discussions section or the shopping blocks or even the sponsored links? This extension lets you hide them. It simply uses CSS to set those areas of the page to be hidden (display=\"none\").\n\nAI overviews are hidden by default but the options menu lets you choose what else you might want to hide: Videos, Discussion blocks, shopping blocks, \"readers also ask\" and sponsored blocks are also available to hide. Note that, if Google changes its CSS, we'll have to update the extension to keep pace.\n\nYou can also search the Google web results tab from your address bar by hitting w + space and then entering your query.\n\nVersion 1.3: Fixes bug with \"people also ask filtering,\" now filters out AI overviews and ads in non-English Google display languages, including: Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese (Taiwan and PRC) and Japanese."
