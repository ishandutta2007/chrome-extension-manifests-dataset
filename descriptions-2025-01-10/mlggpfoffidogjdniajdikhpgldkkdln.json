In the upper-left corner of the game screen, you'll see a timer counting down from 60 seconds. On the top-right, your current score is shown.\n\nHow to Play:\n\n1. Click on a cell with a letter to choose it. Once selected, the cell will be highlighted.\n\n2. Click on another cell with a letter to exchange their positions. The highlight will disappear from the first cell after the swap. You can also swap with an empty cell.\n\n3. If you have three identical letters arranged horizontally or vertically as neighbors, they will vanish from the grid, and your score will go up by 3 points.\n\n4. If you successfully remove all sets of three identical letters from the grid before the timer runs out, you win, and a victory message will appear in an overlay. Otherwise, you lose.\n\nTips to Win:\n\n- Have a quick scan of the entire grid for potential matches. Pay extra attention to neighboring identical letters and eliminate them first.\n\n- Swap letters with empty cells can help you create new matches.\n\nEnjoy playing the Letter Swap Game! Strive to achieve the highest score by cleverly swapping letters and removing matching sets!\n\nCHANGELOG\n==========\nVersion 0.1.1\n- Add google analytics\n\nVersion 0.1.0\n- Initial release of game"
