You can then click on \"Close LRU Tab\". On clicking this button, Tab A will be closed.  If you were to then click the button again, it would close Tab B. \n\nThe last accessed information is pulled from the chrome Tabs API and is defined as the last time tab was brought in focus. As a result, if you had a tab open from 2024 but accessed it most recently, it will NOT be the tab thats closed. \n\nThe inspiration behind this stems from how processors using caching where they move Least Recently Used part of the memory into slower part of the memory while keeping most recently used in faster memory for easier access. The goal of this extension is to help you decide which tabs to close. Often we have a multitude of tabs open never to use them again! If you have not accessed that tab in a long time, its highly unlikely you will need it!"
