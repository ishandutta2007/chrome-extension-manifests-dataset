Link feedback to existing ideas and associate feedback with known customers and accounts with automated, AI-driven searches.\n\nCapture Feedback in Three Simple Steps\n\n1) Capture feedback wherever you are:\nThe Uservoice extension enables easy customer feedback collection, letting teams grab feedback from any web page or browser-based email. Simply open the extension and highlight page text to capture the customer’s feedback in their own words.\n\nCustomer-facing teams working with end users over calls or meetings?  With real-time feedback collection, teams can also drop open-text feedback directly into the extension, and attach supporting docs or screenshots to supplement the feedback from customers.\n\n2) Link or Create an Idea:\n\nIs a customer providing an idea or feedback that your team is already researching? Is your team trying to collect user opinions on critical feedback from other customers? AI-driven search automatically finds existing, related feedback and with 1 click attach the new feedback keeping everything organized. The extension will also relay feedback analytics, like revenue value and reach back to the user to provide insight into the relative value of any given idea.\n\n3) Add a user and subscribe\n\nThe UserVoice extension will suggest users to associate to the feedback, or teams can search for and associate users from their UserVoice database to the feedback manually.\nOnce you’ve identified the appropriate user, the team can then subscribe that customer to future status updates and communications directly from the product team, improving customer engagement.\n\n\nThe Best Feedback Solution for Product Management Teams\n\nWant to start capturing customer feedback? UserVoice provides leading product teams with the ability to capture and prioritize the most critical needs of their end users. Join us here: https://bit.ly/3LeRudE"
