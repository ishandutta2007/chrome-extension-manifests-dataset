Because it utilizes the Yammer OpenGraph, you'll also be able to see any previous conversations in your Yammer network that link the current page. Great for starting conversations about websites or online videos, as well as any Office 365 and SharePoint pages or documents that don't have Yammer conversations already built in.\n\nThe developer of this extension is in no way affiliated with Yammer or Microsoft.\n\nChange log:\nv1.1 - Minor updates to improve loading times\nv1.0 - Launch!"
