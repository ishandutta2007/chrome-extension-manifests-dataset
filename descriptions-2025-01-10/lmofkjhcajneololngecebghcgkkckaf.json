Each unread email gets a 12-hour countdown timer. Reply, Mark as Read, Delete or Archive - act on your unread emails quickly to prevent them from piling. \n\nThere are 3 stages to this time. \n1. When you get an email, a normal 12-hour countdown timer starts.\n2. After 4 hours, you've 8 hours left to reply and your timer will turn *orange*.\n3. After 11 hours, you've only 1 left to reply. Your timer is now *red* and you should act on it immediately.\n\nOnce emails are over 4 days due, the timer shuts down (since it's probably not worth tracking anymore!)\n\nThese urgency levels are customizable and can be set to any value.\n\nBy adhering to the countdown timer, clients and co-workers alike might notice your promptness and ability to deal with a massive inbox flow. Be in control of your email before it controls you and get to Inbox Zero daily."
