Once I opened Facebook or YouTube, I'd fall into the rabbit hole of endless scrolling and end up wasting precious time.\n\nThis plugin is my solution to controlling that \"momentary urge\" to visit distracting sites and preventing myself from falling into the abyss of wasted time.\n\nI noticed that similar plugins come with high subscription fees for such a simple feature. That's why I decided to create this plugin and make it *completely free* for anyone to use.\n\nPlease note that there may still be some bugs, and I'd appreciate your feedback. If you encounter any issues, feel free to report them, and Iâ€™ll do my best to resolve them. If this plugin helps you, leaving a review would mean a lot and would motivate me to continue improving it."
