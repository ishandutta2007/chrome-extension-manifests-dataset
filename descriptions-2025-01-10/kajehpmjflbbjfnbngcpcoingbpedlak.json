Easily swap models in and out to find the combination that works best for you\n    \n- Text is only the beginning - Image analysis and video analysis coming soon. After installing the extension, it is simple to highlight any text online and request an instant analysis. Our Detector will tell you right away if the words are likely to be written by a human or if they show AI patterns.\n\nAI detection cannot be 100% accurate, but we continue to improve the Fakespot ApolloDFT Engine to make it as reliable as possible.
