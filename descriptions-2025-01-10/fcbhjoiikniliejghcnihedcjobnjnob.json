Every time you are about to work on something new, it will immediately remind you to take a second and breathe - lowering your cortisol levels, which in turn lowers your stress levels, heart rate, blood pressure, and anxiety.\n\nEvery time you open a new tab and start another work session, take a minute to breath five deep breaths using the guided visual experience. After finishing the short exercise you will get inspired with a random motivational quote to boost your productivity and give you a nice serotonin boost."
