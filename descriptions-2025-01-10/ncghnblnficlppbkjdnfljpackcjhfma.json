You know that red mist that descends when you see that sidebar full of pictures ridiculing celebrities for having cellulite or being overweight? You know how your blood pressure goes through the roof when you accidentally read one of the comments? Well, here’s a safety net for your browser.\"\n\nIf you accidentally visit a Daily Mail page, this extension will replace it with a filtered version, removing the Sidebar of Shame, the comments, and various other junk.\n\nThe source code can be found at https://github.com/threedaymonk/mailsanitiser"
