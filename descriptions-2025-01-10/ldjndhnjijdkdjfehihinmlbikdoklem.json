This provides a better overview and makes it easier to navigate through complex processes.\n\nCopying expressions to the clipboard: You can simply copy expressions to the clipboard. This makes it easier to share and reuse code segments.\n\nEnlargeable text fields: Text fields can now be enlarged to make it easier to read and edit longer texts or complex expressions.\n\nAdjustments to the appearance of the cards: The appearance of the cards has been adjusted, including rounded corners, changed background and gridded alignment of the elements, which provides more space for the text fields.\n\nPowerFx editor: The PowerFx editor has been fixed to the right edge and enlarged, improving visibility and accessibility."
