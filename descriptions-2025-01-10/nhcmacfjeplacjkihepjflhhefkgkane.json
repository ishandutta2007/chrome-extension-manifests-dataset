This organisation has started with a mind set to share the knowledge that the internet or individuals have in a progressive manner. SkillRary is an online training programme trying to get the best content for all on a very low cost there by helping everyone with a digital schooling and online education.\n\nOur training is a computer based training (CBT), distance learning, or e-learning, that takes place completely on the internet. The courses involve a variety of multimedia elements, including graphics, audio, video, and web-links, which all can be accessed to the enrolled clients.  \n\nIn addition to presenting course material and content, SkillRary gives the students the opportunity for live interactions and real-time feedback for such things as quizzes and tests. Interactions between instructor and students are also conducted via chat, e-mail, or other web-based communication. Unlike any other we here also let the students know which module has to be gone through first. All the modules are placed according to the lesson plans so that students will know what to refer first.\n\nSkillRary is self-paced and customisable to suit an individual's specific learning needs. Therefore, it can be conducted at any time and place, provided there is a computer with high-speed internet access. This makes it very convenient for the users, who can modify their training to fit into their day-to-day schedule. All our users will be able to use our eLearning system to its full capacity."
