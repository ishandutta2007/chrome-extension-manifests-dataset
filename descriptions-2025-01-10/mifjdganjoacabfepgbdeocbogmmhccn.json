Since Pinterest only provides a save button that references the current URL in the navigation bar, the new button creates a proper Pinterest popup with a URL formatted to include the tweet description and link.\n\nNote: If you want to pin multiple images from a tweet containing more than one image, make sure to save the first image first. Pinterest can only create a proper pin with the first image in the tweet, while the remaining images will be saved as \"child\" references to that first pin, it works as if we were \"completing\" the images from a website with static images\n\nIf you discover that the Pinterest save button doesn’t work correctly on a specific website, feel free to email me at dpineda.dev@gmail.com, and I’ll try to implement a custom solution for that site."
