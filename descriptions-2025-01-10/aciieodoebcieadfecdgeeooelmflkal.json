When it found an available delivery window it will notify you using chrome notification.\n\nQ2: Will this extension cause my account to be blocked?\nA2: Again, it just replaces you refreshing webpage and looking at the screen. And this extension will use a reasonable refresh rate.\n\nQ3: Is there any security problem when I use this extension?\nA3: This is just a refresh tool and finds a specific element to detect if it currently has an available delivery window. Therefore, it does not have a security problem.\n\nQ4: Will this be unfair to other Amazon, Costco and Instacart users?\nA4: This is an ethical issue. But please DO NOT abuse this extension.\n\n# Contact\napps@xswl.me"
