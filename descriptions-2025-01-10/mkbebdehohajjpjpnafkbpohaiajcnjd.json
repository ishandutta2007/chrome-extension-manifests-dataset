But if you just sit there on the page doing nothing, it might start, and you wouldn't even know! Then you end up missing part of it, and that's no fun. Use this extension instead. It adds a button to the livestream page that will check for a stream every 30 seconds, and reload the page to start it when it finds one. Now you can go off and do other things while you wait for Milo to get his act together and start his show, and still be sure you won't miss anything!"
