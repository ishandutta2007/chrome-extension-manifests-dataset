Using a reminder system and a simple interface to help you identify what your feeling, \"I Feel\" helps you figure out what you're feeling and quickly take note of it.\nFor those wanting to take a deeper dive, you also have the option of digging into that feeling, using CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) techniques, to help figure out what's going on under the surface and find ways to adjust your thinking to change your mood."
