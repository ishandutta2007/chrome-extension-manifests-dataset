This browser extension can help you.\n\nDon't Visit blocks access to specifiable sites or pages. By default it blocks navigating to the specified sites or pages completely, but if desired it can also provide the option to suspend a block for a couple of minutes. \n\n\nOpen the options page (you can find it by clicking the Don't Visit icon next to the address bar, or by clicking \"More Tools>Extensions\" in the menu and navigating to \"Don't Visit\") to add or remove blocked sites.\n\nPlease note: This extension is intended to help with productivity or self-control, it's not supposed to wall sites from third parties, since the extension can always be disabled or uninstalled if desired.\n\n\nUpdate 2019-09-30: Don't Visit utilizes the webRequest API now, the same one used by ad-blocker addons. This allows blocking sites from loading inside frames as well, as opposed to only blocking top level navigations."
