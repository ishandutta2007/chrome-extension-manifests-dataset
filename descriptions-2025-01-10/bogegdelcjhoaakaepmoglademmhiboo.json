Since the forums now track threads for you, SALR only enhances the functionality rather than implement it.\n\nNotable features:\n- Quick reply\n- Thread highlighting\n- Mouse navigation\n- Keyboard shortcuts\n- Order previously seen threads first\n- Highlight when people quote you\n- Page navigator\n- Forums jump list"
