I tried many Chrome extensions that test responsive designs, but most of them were too bloated or inconvenient. So I created my own. I've been using it daily, so I thought â€“ why not publish it, maybe it will be useful for you too!\n\n~*~ 3 PHONES, 3 TABLES ~*~\n\nMost extensions require that I configure my own list of favorite devices. Responsive Buddy offers 3 phone and 3 tablet sizes, from small to large. \n\n~*~ ZOOM OUT (100 to 70%) ~*~\n\nUseful if you want to compensate the difference between your monitod DPI (pixel density) and the DPI of a target mobile device.\n\n~*~ PORTRAIT / LANDSCAPE ~*~\n\nSwitch between portrait and landscape orientation with a click of a button.\n\n~*~ IFRAME MODE OFF BUTTON ~*~\n\nBy default, Responsive Buddy creates a window with an iframe, then transforms it to the selected zoom setting. It works well, unless your website refuses to be opened in an iframe. If that's the case, you can turn \"iframe mode\" off.\n\n~*~ DARK MODE SUPPORT ~*~\n\nYour eyes will thank you!"
