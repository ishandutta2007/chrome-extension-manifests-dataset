You can help combat climate change, for free, by supporting one of our great carbon offset projects. \n\nðŸŒŽ SAVE MONEY WITH AUTOMATIC DISCOUNTS ðŸŒŽ \n\nThis extension also saves you time and money by testing all available discount codes, when you reach the checkout page, and automatically applying the one that saves you the most money. \n\nðŸŒŽ HOW IT WORKS ðŸŒŽ \n\nJust shop online as you normally would.  When you reach a partner website, youâ€™ll activate GreenEarth Rewards with one click. This triggers our partner to pay us a commission when you make a purchase (or complete some other action). We use that commission to fund support your chosen carbon offset projects, offsetting your carbon footprint â€“ for free. \n\nðŸŒŽ YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT ðŸŒŽ \n\nThe GreenEarth Rewards extension does not collect any of your personal information or payment details. It does not view your emails or record your searches. Also, we never sell your data to advertisers or other third parties. \n\nðŸŒŽ YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ðŸŒŽ \n\nBy using this extension, you will be directly helping combat climate change. The money we earn from this system goes directly towards the carbon offset project of your choice (see them Ã  https://rewards.greeningtheearth.com/projects). We retain part of the revenue to build and maintain our free tools. \n\nIf you create a GreenEarth Rewards account, and sign into your account through the extension, your activity will be recorded to your account, and you will receive email notifications of you impact.   \n\nðŸŒŽ WHO WE ARE ðŸŒŽ \n\nGreening the Earth (GTE) is an agricultural program that generates internationally accredited carbon offsets from soil carbon by restoring the natural capital of marginal and climatically impacted Australian farmland. This free browser extension helps us raise money to support our carbon offset projects. \n\nðŸŒŽ REQUIRED PERMISSIONS ðŸŒŽ \n\n\"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" Ã  so that our extension can automatically recognize when you visit a partner website and apply discount codes for you. \n\nBy clicking \"Add to Chrome\", I accept and agree to installing the GreenEarth Rewards extension and the Privacy Policy (https://rewards.greeningtheearth.com/privacy) and Terms of Service (https://rewards.greeningtheearth.com/terms)"
