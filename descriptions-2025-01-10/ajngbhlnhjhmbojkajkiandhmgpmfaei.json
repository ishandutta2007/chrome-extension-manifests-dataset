A high rent to price ratio is an indicator of cashflow. School ratings are an indicator of neighborhood quality and appreciation potential. Use this tool to find deals with high marks in both categories, quickly! \n\nThere are thousands of single family homes on the market and it takes hours to find deals that will simply cashflow, but finding deals that will cashflow AND are located in decent areas takes days. This tool allows you to do it in minutes. \n\nIt's used by out of state investors to quickly pinpoint prime locations in new markets. Realtors use this tool to find investment options for their clients. Anybody who is looking to buy single family rental properties will use this tool daily to identify opportunities and build out their shortlist of deals to submit offers on.\n\nAfter the extension is downloaded, open zillow, input your standard search criteria (location, bedroom count, square footage, year build, etc.). You will see a new feature on Zillow's filter bar labeled \"Rent Ratio\". Enter your minimum rent to price ratio (.75%, 1%, 2%, etc.) and hit \"scan\". \n\nThe tool will find all properties that meet your criteria and have rent to price ratios equal to or greater than the percentage you entered. You'll see the link to the property listing, the property's rent to price ratio, and the property's school ratings outlined cleanly on a table.\n\nA few notes:\n-the tool covers all 50 states\n-the tool is free to use for the first 30 days after downloading\n-$99 per month after the 30 day trial\n-no credit card needed to sign up or start using the full version of the tool"
