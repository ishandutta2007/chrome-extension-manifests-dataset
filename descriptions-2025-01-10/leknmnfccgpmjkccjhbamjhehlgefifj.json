See instructions here: https://wp.nyu.edu/ibleaman/yiddish/typing/\nNote that the commands using Alt are not included in this version. Also, the Caps Lock feature is disabled (since Chromebook is missing a Caps Lock button).\n\nOnce you've installed the extension, sign out of your Chromebook and then sign back in. Then go into your system settings, type \"language\" into the search bar, and click \"Language and input settings...\" Unfortunately, because Chromebook lacks native support for Yiddish, the keyboard can be found under English (United States). Select \"Yiddish Klal\" as an input method and click through to accept the third party terms (contrary to the warning, all this app does is take your keystroke and print out a Yiddish character; nothing is saved, and the app is completely offline). Finally, click \"Done.\" I also recommend hiding the Yiddish Klal icon from your Chrome browser menu, since it doesn't do anything. Right click (or click with two fingers) on the Yiddish Klal icon and then \"Hide in Chrome menu.\"\n\nTo switch between Yiddish and other keyboards, click Ctrl + Shift + space.\n\nUpdates:\n0.2 - bug fixes (and the \"|\" key now creates em-dash)"
