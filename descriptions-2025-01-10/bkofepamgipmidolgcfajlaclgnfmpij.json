WebStylus makes the internet a more accessible and customizable place, so everyone can better enjoy the knowledge it has to offer.\n\nWebStylus allows the user to customize their browsing experience to their own needs. WebStylus boasts dark and night mode filters, saturation and contrast adjustment, and an experimental colourblind-accessible function. This blend of features makes it so that this extension helps the visually impaired with their browsing, while still offering convenient customizability for everyday users.\n\nWebStylus is still in early development. In the future, it will have more advanced customizability and accessibility features, such as AI alt text, text-to-speech, and more! \n\nDeveloped by Matthew Y, Raymon D, and Derek G."
