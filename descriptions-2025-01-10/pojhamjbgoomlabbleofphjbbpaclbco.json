Make sure you are thoughtfully living in every moment. Put in your birthdate and with every new tab, be reminded by how many weeks you have left to live with a striking visual. Each \"X\" shows you how many weeks you have already lived and each \".\" reminds you of the ones you have left (but only on average!). In the options tab, you can adjust your birthdate, and colour scheme."
