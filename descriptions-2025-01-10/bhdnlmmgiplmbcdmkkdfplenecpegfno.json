You can then use the script to create a canary in Amazon Cloudwatch Synthetics.\n \nCloudWatch Synthetics canaries are configurable scripts that run on a schedule to monitor your endpoints and APIs. Canaries can follow the same routes and perform the same actions as a customer, which makes it possible for you to continually verify your customer experience even when you don't have any customer traffic on your applications.\n \nFor more information about CloudWatch Synthetics, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html. \n \nBy installing or using this extension, you agree that your installation and use of this extension is governed by https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/ or other agreement between you and AWS governing your use of our services.\n\nCredits: CloudWatch Synthetics Recorder is based on the Headless recorder(https://github.com/checkly/headless-recorder)."
