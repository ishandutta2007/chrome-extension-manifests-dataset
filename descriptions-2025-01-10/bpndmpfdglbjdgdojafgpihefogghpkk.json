Youtube recommendations can get sickening to the stomach. We all go to see a glimpse of a single video on Youtube but with the eye-catching recommendations, we fall in its time-wasting trap. Video after video, recommendations after recommendations and minute after a minute we just fall deeper and deeper in its mesh trap. Hours can pass without we even getting aware of it. Some of us are better at fighting the urge or at stopping, but it is always hard.\n\n\"Section Blocker\" will help you to get rid of the recommended videos by popping the motivational quotes in the place of the suggested videos, and gives you the complete control on managing and reducing your youtube consumption.\n\nThe user can change the settings from the extension and can see the recommended videos for a limited period of time and once it's over the extension will again block the recommendations automatically.\n\nLet us know if you find any bugs or face any difficulty with the extension, or send feedback to www.mukulkhanna.xyz/sectionblocker/ Or sectionblocker.inbox@gmail.com"
