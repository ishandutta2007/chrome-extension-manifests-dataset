Additionally monospace will highlight and add line numbers to files viewed in the chrome file viewer. Multiple highlighting themes are included and can be switched in the options menu.\n\nTo use monospace simply send code through facebook wrapped with the delimiters set in the options page.\n\nEXAMPLES: \n\n  - ```for x in range(0:10):\n       print(x)```\n\n  - you can also have ```inline code``` \n\n\nNotes: \nThis is still very much a work in progress. I'm currently looking for bugs and unintended behavior. I'll remove all the console logs once I'm satisfied with its stability.\n\nThe UI is still pretty clunky since I haven't spent much time working on that. I'll revamp the options page and the chrome webstore page soon.\n\nBy default monospace uses three backticks (like markdown). Monospace will also reverse the start delimiter and use that as the end delimiters unless a custom end delimiter is specified. Pages will need to be refreshed to use the new delimiters.\n\nIf there are more than one line breaks in a row, monospace will reduce them to a single line break. This is due to limitations with how Facebook displays messages.\n\nRemoving items from the whitelist will prevent monospace from acting on that item. Currently the functionality of the whitelist is very basic."
