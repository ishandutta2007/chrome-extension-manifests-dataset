Main features include:\n\n- Upload multiple files at once.\n- Ability to drag & drop files anywhere on FurAffinity's upload page.\n- Edit details on the fly and save them to use later as Upload Defaults.\n- Have series and comics update their links to previous/next/first submissions automatically.\n- Organize everything into a list to be uploaded sequentially while you relax in the background.\n- New notification system that displays new submissions, comments, journals, favorites and notes directly through your toolbar.\n- Disable FurAffinity's compression and upload images based on their original quality.\n\nNo more wasting time going through 4 different pages just to upload a single file to FurAffinity or having to click every single page to see the new comments you've received, install FABUI on your browser now and make your user-experience on FurAffinity so much better!\n\nIcons made by Smashicons from www.flaticon.com\nRich-text Editor by Quill from www.quilljs.com"
