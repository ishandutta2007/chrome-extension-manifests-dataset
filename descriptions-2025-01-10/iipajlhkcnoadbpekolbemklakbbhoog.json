Wouldn't it be far easier if that task was done automatically and inside the website?\n\nWell, this extension brings a solution to that problem! You no longer need to go inside Geometry Dash just to check if the song can be used or not each and every single time (which can be a pain in mobile or slow computers).\n\nHow does it work?\nYou can either search the ID clicking on the extension and in the \"Search\" button, or you can directly go to the song site and when clicking the extension it will automatically tell you if that song is available for use or not.\n\nAs a bonus feature, when you are searching songs in the audio tab, it will show every song it has searched in the past from any user, and change the title of the song to a green colour if it is for use, or to a red colour if it is not. If the song has never been searched before it will appear yellow as it normally does until you click on that song and check if is is available.\nThat means the extension works as a community effort aswell! The more songs a user checks, the more others will benefit from knowing beforehand if the song is usable for Geometry Dash or not.\n\nRight now, the extension connects to a free hosting service which connects to the GD servers. This is done to avoid some limitations. That means sometimes the extension might slow down or go down for a few minutes since the hosting is not the best. If you want, you can donate with the goal of upgrading the hosting of the server, to reduce these drawbacks, here: https://ko-fi.com/lucasins. Thanks for your support!"
