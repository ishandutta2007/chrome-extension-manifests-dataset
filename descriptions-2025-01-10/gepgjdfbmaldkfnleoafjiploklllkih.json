Veezn keeps all your data locally and provides a 'streaming service'-like UI for your local web-compatible video files.\n\nVeezn allows you among other things to:\n- transparently import some data on your web-compatible video files into the app in order to keep track of them;\n- initiate a viewing session of your video files;\n- rate any video file while watching it;\n- save some reactions to a scene of a video with an emoji-picker control;\n- add a subtitle to a video file like any standalone video player;\n- keep track of all your viewing sessions;\n- be given a selection of your imported video files to watch next based on your watching history;\n- record an audio of a specific sequence of a video file or a soundtrack for later listening;\n- set a reminder for a planned viewing session in the app;\n\nVeezn (still in beta) doesn't allow you in any ways to stream a movie."
