Make all blues purple, all reds green.\n - Colour saturation\nyou can't see the difference between two shades in a poorly made map\n - Sepia\nyou're favourite networking site wont allow you to customise the colour theme, this will do it!\n - Blur\nyou're an employee wanting to instantly obscure whatever it is you're not meant to be looking at with the click of a mouse\n - Brightness\nyou're up too late and the page is blinding you\n\nThis extension modifies how a page's colours are displayed to you by applying visual filters to the entire page.\nIt's like applying photo filters to all web pages!\n\n\n\nNew to version 2:\n - create any number of profiles\n - have these profiles automatically apply to web pages or whole sites\n - edit these profiles and have the changes automatically spread to the pages you've already set to use it\n - previously required no permissions!
