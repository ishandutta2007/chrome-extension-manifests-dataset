However, due to the ease of creating article websites, fake news has become rampant in recent years. This team has created a Chrome plugin so that news-readers can get a reasonable assessment of a news article’s trustworthiness right in the browser where the article is being displayed.\nThis report will detail the efforts, methods, and results of the team’s work, and at the end of the report, links to the various media and artefacts can be found."
