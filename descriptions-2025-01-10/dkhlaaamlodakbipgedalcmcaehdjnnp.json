However, it can be incredibly difficult to remember a seperate password for all of your accounts. \n\nEnter the Master Password Service! Now you only need one password without compromising security. When you make an account for anything, simply enter your one Master Password and the name of the service you're signing up for above (eg. Skype) and we'll tell you the password to use. \n\nThen, when you want to log in again, enter the same information and the same password will be generated again!\n\nAll of your passwords in one place."
