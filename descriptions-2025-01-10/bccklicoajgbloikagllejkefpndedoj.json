We realised that solving this problem had huge potential to save a lot of time for immigration consultants, making visa applications a much smoother and quicker process.\n\nWhat is the solution that we came up with?\n\nWe wanted to solve this problem for immigration agents by providing an innovative tool that could enable quick and easy form filling. Ezymigrate has now mastered this in our development of ‘Ezyforms,’ - an extension tool that allows you to autofill your clients data.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nUsing our Ezymigrate system, you can use either custom forms or our provided visa forms. You can request your client to fill the form with their data themselves, or your team can fill it for them.\n\nOnce the form is filled with all the complete info and data, it’s as easy as clicking the ‘submit form’ button to upload it into the Ezyform system.\n\nYou now have easy access to all of your clients relevant data. Now it’s time to create a visa application - using Ezyform’s autofill feature.\n\nFirst, you’ll need to download the Ezyform extension and add it to your Google Chrome Toolbar. Next, go to the NZ online service form to make your client visa application.\n\nClick your Ezyform toolbar extension\nClick on the client name\nClick ‘autofill.’\n\nYour clients relevant details are uploaded onto the form within seconds - like magic.\n\nWhat is the benefit that it has?\n\nWe developed this because we recognised a gap in the industry that could solve needless use of time and make the application process much more efficient.\nThis is a highly innovative tool, not available anywhere else in the world - we are the first to provide this feature to the immigration industry."
