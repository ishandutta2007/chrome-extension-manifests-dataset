Make sure to \"pin\" the extension icon for easy access.\n\nShortcuts added:\nThe following shortcuts are currently available, all configurable.\n\n– Like video: [\n– Dislike video: ]\n– Save current position: B\n– Restore saved position: R\n– Delete saved position: Shift-B\n– Undo time jump: U\n– Play faster: {\n– Play slower: }\n– Picture-in-picture: H\n– Show channel info: Y\n\nThese shortcuts can be accompanied by a discreet notification at the bottom right of your screen. Those can be helpful to confirm your action if you’re watching the video in full screen, for example: you’ll see a small message saying “liked video” for a short time before it disappears.\n\nTime jumps:\nTwo configurable “time jumps” are available. Each one lets you configure a fixed amount of time to skip ahead or go back in a video, and which keyboard shortcuts to use to go back or forward by this amount.\n\nFirst time jump, adds or removes 3 seconds by default:\n– Go back 3 seconds: Z\n– Go forward 3 seconds: X\n\nSecond time jump, skips or rewinds only 1 second by default (for more precise control):\n\n– Go back 1 second: Shift+Z\n– Go forward 1 second: Shift+B\n\nYou can of course configure the duration to jump through the video for each one, for example if you prefer 5 seconds instead of 3.\n\nYouTube Shorts:\nWhen you watch YouTube Shorts, this extension makes available some keyboard shortcuts that already exist in the regular player, so you can use them for Shorts too. These include:\n\n– Pressing 0, 1, … 9 to jump to 0%, 10%, … 90% of the video’s duration.\n– Pressing J and L to go back or forward by 10 seconds.\n– Pressing , (comma) and . (period) to go back or forward by a single frame.\n– Pressing C opens the comments panel.\n– Pressing W opens the Short video in the regular video player.\n\nThe other shortcuts listed above (like time skips, saving/restoring position, etc.) are all available when you watch Shorts, too.\n\nAutoplay next Short:\nAside from keyboard shortcuts, the extension also lets you configure what to do at the end of a Short: either loop back to the beginning as YouTube does by default, or start playing the next Short automatically.\n\nChannel information:\nWhile watching a video (including Shorts), you can press Y to show some details about the channel that posted the video: their biography, links, etc.\n\nFinally, a few more options let you configure the regular video player to your liking, such as:\n– Removing the “>>> 5 sec” indicators over the video every time you press arrow keys.\n– Removing the “watch next” overlays that can clutter the end of a video.\n\nPrivacy:\nThe extension does NOT track your data. Your data is NEVER collected or sent anywhere.\nThe extension has access to YouTube, and nothing else. It does not use any analytics service.\n\nDisclaimer:\nAll features are free. The software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind.\nSuggestions, bug reports, feature requests and feedback are all welcome! Please send them by email to keyboard-playback@pm.me\n\nImportant:\nYouTube™ is a trademark of Google LLC.\nThis extension is NOT built or sponsored or endorsed IN ANY WAY by Google.\n\nVersion 1.0.1:\n– Improved channel information modal dialog (press Y when watching a video), focusing on the user experience and readability.\n– Added Shift+N and Shift+P for next/previous Shorts, like on regular videos in a playlist.\n– Made the pop-up options and shortcuts on Shorts more reliable.\n\nVersions 1.0.2/1.0.3:\n– Bugfixes"
