There is a method to 'hide' whitespace-only changes, however, this will reset the moment you navigate away or to a new pull request. There\ncurrently isn't a way to ensure this is the 'default' setting.\n\nWhen this extension is installed and enabled, all github.com urls containing the expression /pulls/ will be rewritten to have ?w=1 as a query parameter (without mangling the other params). As a result, all Github code reviews will always ignore whitespace, rather than having to toggle it for each review (See example image). This is a useful feature when having to review a lot of code that has a lot of whitespace in it.\n\nIf Github someday makes this a profile setting rather than a transient one, this extension will no longer be needed."
