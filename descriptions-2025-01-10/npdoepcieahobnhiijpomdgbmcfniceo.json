You can answer with as much or as little detail as you'd like; the more in-depth your answer, the more you will be rewarded when you rediscover your answers a year later!\n\nTime Capsule lives on the new tab page. Whenever you open a new tab, you will see the question of the day. To answer, simply type your response in the answer box and it will automatically be saved. If you feel that your answer is too sensitive to accidentally show, you can hide your answer to prevent the answer from appearing when you open a new tab. In short, Time Capsule is like a daily diary - a space for personal reflection that's always available to you.\n\nWhen you have used Time Capsule for over a year, answers that you gave in previous years will appear under the daily question. This gives you a little insight into how you've changed over time - in fun or even dramatic ways.\n\nFinally, the page features a clock and your choice of ten beautiful background themes."
