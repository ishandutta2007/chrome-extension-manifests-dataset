There's also a slideshow.\n\nVersion 2.1 adds the Title when you choose to display a caption in a slideshow. Also, it fixes a bug with galleries (albums) that are at the top level (in no folder).\n\nVersion 2.0 has lots of internal changes related to using SmugMug's newest API. Visible improvements include a much speedier initial display of folders and an easier-to-navigate list of folders and galleries in a folder. A count of images in a gallery is now shown. A Logout button has been added.\n\nVersion 1.5 allows you to set the slideshow interval (5 sec. to 5 min.) and control whether captions appear.\n\nVersions 1.3 and 1.4 fix some bugs related to the slideshow and add some cosmetic features.\n\nVersion 1.2 provides a slideshow feature, perfect for setting up a SmugMug Digital Photo Frame.
