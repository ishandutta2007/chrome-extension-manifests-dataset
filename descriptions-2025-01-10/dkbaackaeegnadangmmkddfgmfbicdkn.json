The extension adds some buttons to the page via jQuery that the user can see and click. The buttons are added by clicking the Chrome extension icon while on the appropriate page and are only added on the currently active tab. When clicked, the data on the page will be organized either by ascending serial number or descending price. Notable serial numbers (repeating numbers, some \"pleasing to the eye\" whole numbers) will also be highlighted with a brighter text color. These buttons only appear on exactly one single page on the NBA TopShot website and do not impact any existing functionality. It simply serves as an organization tool."
