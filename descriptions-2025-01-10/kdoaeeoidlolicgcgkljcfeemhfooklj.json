FormSquared to PDF automatically adds a Download button to each form to streamline the download process.\n\n✅ Avoid cluttered PDFs: removes unnecessary clutter from the form before downloading to create readable PDF files.\n\n✅ Automatic file names: saves time and helps identify your downloaded form more easily. v1.1 now adds dates to filenames for even easier identification.\n\n\n\n⚠️ Note: Chrome will use your default download settings to save the PDF.
