In this game, you will be presented with a grid of letters and four given words. The goal is to find all given words from the 2-D grid. These words can be placed either horizontally or vertically within the grid. New words will be given when the game starts/restarts. Can you spot them all and complete the challenge? Let's get started!\n\nHow to Play:\n- To play the game, simply click on any letter in the grid to start searching for words.\n- If the clicked letter is the starting letter of any given word, the game will check horizontally and vertically to find the complete word.\n- If a word is found, it will be highlighted with a color to indicate that you've discovered it.\n- The game ends when you successfully find and highlight all given words.\n\nNew Feature: \nWhen you earn points in the game, a random cheerleader animation plays to celebrate your achievement on game over page. Plus, you can choose to save your score to our platform (cheergame.co) by clicking the 'Save to Exchange Cheerleaders' button. This allows you to track your progress and exchange custom animations. This feature is completely optionalâ€”you can skip it if you prefer not to save your score.\n\nHelpful Hints:\n1. Look both ways: words can be hidden both horizontally and vertically, so be thorough in your search.\n\n2. Stay patient: Some words may be easier to find than others. Don't get discouraged; keep searching!\n\nHave fun with word search game! Additionally, we've added some of our latest games at the bottom for your extra enjoyment.\n\nCHANGELOG\n==========\nVersion 0.1.3\n- Display cheerleader animation after game over\n- Add the feature of saving earned points\n\nVersion 0.1.1 - 0.1.2\n- Add google analytics\n- Add the section of new games\n- Update game parameter\n\nVersion 0.1.0\n- Initial release of the game"
