Currently, there is no easy way to reset the frequency of all quiz questions at once. Users are required to manually reset the frequency for each question on every page, which can be time-consuming and tedious. This extension solves that problem by providing an efficient way to reset quiz frequencies—either for the current page or across all pages—with just a few clicks. Additionally, it supports dynamic language switching between English and Hebrew, making it accessible to a diverse user base."
