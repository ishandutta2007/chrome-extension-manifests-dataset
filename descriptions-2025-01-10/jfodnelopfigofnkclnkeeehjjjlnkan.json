Participants now only need an internet connection and a regular browser, the same stuff they use everyday online!\n\nHowever, it can be useful to compare data gathered through web experiments with physiological data (like EEG, EMG, Eyetracker) that can only be recorded with sophisticated lab equipement.\n\nRather than wasting time developing the very same experiment both in jsPsych (for the web) and your standard experiment editor (PsychoPy, OpenSesame, E-prime, etc), which runs the risk of introducing confounding differences in the protocols, it would be nice to give jsPsych the power to interface with such equipement. Subjects in the lab would go to the very same URL they would have requested at home, and do the same experiment, only that now, it sends triggers to hardware.\n\nAnd this extension, coupled with a small program available freely on our lab website, allows just that :)"
