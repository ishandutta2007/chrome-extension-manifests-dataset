Works with Reddit Enhancement Suite's never ending scroll.\n\nAre you tired of seeing a pageful of already visited links when you open reddit? This extension will automatically click the 'hide' button beneath reddit posts that are already in your browser history. The posts are hidden when you open reddit or when RES never ending scroll loads a new page.\n\nIf you're using RES, there is a few seconds delay between pressing the 'hide' button and the post disappearing, giving you a chance to unhide the post. I recommend turning that off so that posts hide instantly. You can do that by going to https://www.reddit.com/#res:settings/betteReddit and switching the \"Fix Hide Links\" setting to off.\n\nYou can view posts that have been hidden by going to https://www.reddit.com/<user>/hidden/, making sure to change <user> to your reddit user name.\n\nYou can still manually click the 'hide' button for posts that you don't want to bother visiting.\n\nView the source at https://github.com/jmckib/keep-reddit-fresh"
