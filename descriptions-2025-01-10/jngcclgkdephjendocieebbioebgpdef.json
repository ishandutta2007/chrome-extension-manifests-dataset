Toggle between \"disabled\" (no blocking), \"Half focus\" (Only block a given list of blocked sites), and \"Full focus\" (Block all sites except a given list of allowed sites).\n\nIf you enable the extension in incognito mode, \"Full focus\" mode is automatically enabled on while browsing in incognito.\n\nYou can also force search engines to only search on a single site, to avoid distracting sites appearing in search results.\n\nThis app does not track any metrics or show you any cool graphs. That would be distracting, which is not what this app is meant to be. It also cleans up after itself in your browser history, the \"page blocked\" page does not appear in your history, and neither does the page that was blocked."
