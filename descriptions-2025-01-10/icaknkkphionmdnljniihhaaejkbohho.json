Free plan available.\nDoes not work stand-alone!\n\nFantomo provides a user-friendly centralised solution for simplifying the management of messages and notifications while users browse particular websites. This Chrome extension effortlessly links with our management platform, utilizing Google OAuth2 to determine a user's associated domain.\n\nIf your users frequently purchase SaaS tools without your knowledge or are unaware of existing licenses, Fantomo has the solution. With Fantomo, when a user visits a site, you can display a message with clear instructions and a URL (such as a ticketing system link) to streamline this process. It's a powerful tool to minimize shadow IT and regain control.\n\nPRIVACY\nOur commitment to user data privacy is unwavering, and Fantomo does not involve itself in any form of user data tracking. We only verify your account and domain. We only use local storage in your browser. All URL matching is done locally, so the plugin never collects or transmits your browser behaviour or history. No content, visit history or any form of tracking is used server side.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou can create an account on fantomo.io and enjoy free access to Fantomo, which allows you to manage up to 5 messages. To handle a larger volume, a subscription on fantomo.io is necessary.\n\nCurrently only Google Auth - Google Workspace account required to function (legacy or higher).\n\n// Copyright 2024 m8dhouse & finishing line BV\n// All Rights Reserved.\n// This software is proprietary and confidential.
