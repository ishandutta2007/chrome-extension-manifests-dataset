It helps you quickly identify sustainable products and alternatives as you shop online. Install our FREE extension and see overlays that show you the ratings and impact of the products you buy on Amazon.com. Our mission is to empower consumers with data and swing the pendulum in favor of  companies that are mindful of their impact to consumers, their homes and the planet. \n\nEarthly's product ratings and attributes are conveniently displayed as simple to read red / green labels and connect shoppers with the story behind the product. We generate this using a combination of good old-fashioned journalism and the latest in data science to bring trusted research at your fingertips while you shop as you normally would, on your favorite shopping sites (starting with Amazon.com for USA)\n\nWe all have questions: Does this product contain chemicals known to harm humans and/or other life forms? Were animals harmed while developing these products? Does it contain genetically modified organisms? Were the people involved treated equitably? Not only is this information hard to pin down, but it is seldom shown by online marketplaces.  By installing Earthly's extension, you are opting in for this information to be displayed no matter where you shop!\n\nCorporations are simply trying to meet consumer demand, at the cheap price they want, as fast as they want it. Using Earthly, shoppers can turn their buying power into a force for good. By buying better, you're voting with your wallet and telling corporations to align with your ideals and virtues."
