What better place to start than a Google Search? You click the first result. No, this isn't it. But hey, this site links to something that looks promising! Oh, no that's not it either. Oh, but THIS website has a link to a website I like! Darn, not that one.\n\nNow it's time to get back to the search. Looks like you'll have to hit the back button... three times! It feels wrong, doesn't it? There needs to be a faster way to get back to your search...\n\nWell, now there is! Back To Search! With the stroke of a few keys (Alt + Shift + Left Arrow) you'll be quickly taken the last Google Search in your current browser tab.\n\nYou can view the source of this extension here: https://github.com/SidneyNemzer/back-to-search"
