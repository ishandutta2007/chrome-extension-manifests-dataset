You can reset the count at any time and it'll save your previous totals, so you can see how many tabs you've devoured over time. You can also change the background and font color to match your own personal style.\n\nReasons to install this:\n- track how many tabs you've opened in a day, an hour, or a week.\n- get your daily dose of (virtual) french fry goodness.\n\nSee the code at: https://github.com/sajoy/fry-tally"
