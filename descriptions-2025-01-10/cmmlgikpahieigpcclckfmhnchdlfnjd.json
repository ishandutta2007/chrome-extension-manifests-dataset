There are three ways to use WebCache:\n\n1. Click the extension button to view the cached version of the web page\n\n2. Access the cached webpage through the right click menu (enable this setting in the options page)\n\n3. Auto-detect when a webpage is down, and fetch the cached version (enable this setting in the options page)\n\nSource code is available here: https://github.com/Dbz/WebCache\n\nPLEASE REPORT ISSUES/FEATURE REQUESTS HERE: https://github.com/Dbz/WebCache/issues\n\n\nChange Log:\n\nV 4.1.0\n--------\n\n - Wayback Machine URL now takes you directly to the latest snapshot of a page\n - Added Archive.is as to the caches\n - Code Refactoring\n\nV 4.0.0\n--------\n\n - Added right click menu option to view the cached version of a web page\n - Re-wrote the HTML/CSS of the options page\n - Refactoring of the code base\n\n\nV 3.5.6\n---------\n\n - Fixed a bug where first time installers couldn't use the extension before visiting the options page\n\n\nGoogle Cache, Wayback Machine, Coral CDN, cache"
