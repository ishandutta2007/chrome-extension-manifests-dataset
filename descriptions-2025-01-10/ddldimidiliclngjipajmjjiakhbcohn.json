It's great for cycling through tabs on an external display, like a TV.\n\nAuthors: Benjamin Oakes, Madhur Ahuja, and Jim Adamson\n\nTutorial\n\nTabCarousel is simple: open tabs you want to monitor throughout the day, then click the toolbar icon. To stop, click the icon again.\n\nBy default, TabCarousel will flip through your tabs every 15 s, reloading them every 5 min. It's great on a unused display or TV. Put Chrome in full-screen mode (F11, or cmd-shift-f on the Mac) and let it go.\n\nIf you want to change how often TabCarousel flips through your tabs, right click on the toolbar icon and choose \"Options\".\n\nNew in 1.0.3 (2024-06-21):\n\n* Sponsorship links\n\nNew in 1.0.2 (2024-06-19):\n\n* Fix no carouselling when flipWait set to > 30 seconds (Thank you, Jim Adamson!)\n\nNew in 1.0.1 (2024-06-10):\n\n* Fixed auto startup (Thank you, Madhur Ahuja!)\n\nNew in 1.0.0 (2023-12-26):\n\n* Manifest v3 support (Thank you, Madhur Ahuja!)\n\nNew in 0.5.4 (2020-05-14):\n\n* Reduce permissions for Chrome Web Store policies\n\nNew in 0.5.3 (2012-08-21):\n\n* Bug fixes\n\nNew in 0.5.2 (2011-07-06):\n\n* Added an option to start Carousel automatically, by request from a user\n* Tabs that have previously failed to reload now reload correctly\n* Carousel now only flips through tabs in the window in which it was started\n\nExample Uses\n\nOn a computer that has an external display (like an HDTV), try opening:\n\n* NewRelic - Open as many tabs as you want for your apps -- don't forget to turn on \"kiosk mode\"\n* Twitter - Make a list of services you use, for example, and open it\n* Status sites:\n    * GitHub\n    * Heroku\n* Monitor your CI service\n* Packages with tracking information\n* Anything else that's on the web that you want to monitor\n\nThe TabCarousel wiki on GitHub has more: https://github.com/TabCarousel/TabCarousel/wiki\n\nTabCarousel is open source software.
