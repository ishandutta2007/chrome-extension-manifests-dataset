Typing (or pasting) an ID to be encoded which I then want to copy.\n2. Pasting an encoded ID I would like to know the decoded value of or copy the underlying database ID.\n\nI have set the input boxes to select all text on focus, unless a colon is found in the decoded ID, in which case the database ID will be selected."
