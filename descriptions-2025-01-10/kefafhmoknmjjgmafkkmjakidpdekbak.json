It's that easy.\n\n☞ How it works\n\nFor every new browser tab you open see a new and easy tab which includes a handy search. You will also see some ads. We collect ad revenue from the page and use it to donate to the cause you are supporting! You can choose which cause we donate our money to such as reducing single use plastic, saving endangered animals, planting trees etc.\n\n☞ Why we're doing this\n\nOur mission is to make it easy for people to help save the planet. A lot of people we meet with want to make a change to “good” but don’t know what to buy or where to start. That’s why we created This Tab Helps the Planet, a tool where you can raise money for charities just by surfing the web.\n\n☞ Trust in us\n\nAll we care about is helping the planet. We don't care about your details or harnessing data (boring!). We'll also post our financials on our site so keep a look out. We're too new to do this now, won't be soon :)\n\n\n♡ Follow us! ♡\n\nOur blog: https://this-tab.com/blog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/this_tab\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/get.this.tab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/this_tab\n\n☞ Learn more:  https://this-tab.org"
