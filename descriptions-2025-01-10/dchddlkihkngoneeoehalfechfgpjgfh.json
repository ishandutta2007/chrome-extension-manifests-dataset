Ever post a comment on facebook which was negative but you didn't know so? What if we could provide you with a tool that can perform sentiment analysis on your chosen text and give you feedback about its emotional mode. We present to you, Sentimental. Sentimental's analysis inspects the given text and identifies the prevailing emotional opinion within the text, especially to determine a writer's attitude as positive, negative, or neutral. We utilize google's powerful natural language API to analyze your text and present a very succinct review of your text. You just right click and click analyze text sentiment. That's it. Simple isn't it?\n\nBehind the scenes:\n\nWhen you submit a text we calculate its corresponding score and magnitude.The score of a document's sentiment indicates the overall emotion of a document. The magnitude of a document's sentiment indicates how much emotional content is present within the document, and this value is often proportional to the length of the document.\n\nA document with a neutral score (around 0.0) may indicate a low-emotion document, or may indicate mixed emotions, with both high positive and negative values which cancel each out. Generally, you can use magnitude values to disambiguate these cases, as truly neutral documents will have a low magnitude value, while mixed documents will have higher magnitude values."
