Simply type 'r' into your search bar, and then follow it up with a [TAB]. Then, type in your favorite subreddit to go to.\n\nThis extension even keeps a tab of the most visited subreddits, so you can speed up the process even more!\n\nThis will work no matter what site you are currently on.\nInterested in the source code? You'll find it at https://github.com/joshdabosh/reddit-redirector, where you can also submit Pull Requests / Issues."
