Highlight public comments on a JIRA issue page.\n2. Warn users before posting a comment publicly that can be viewed by people outside their organisation like customers or general public for open source JIRA projects. This is really helpful when developers and project managers have numerous source specific \"Restricted to Organisation\" conversations on JIRA comments as well and this extension helps them cut through the clutter to maintain the correct story progression for the public conversations if any exists.\n\nBONUS FEATURES IF BRANCH NAMES AND COMMIT NAMES HAVE JIRA ISSUE ID AND YOU USE GITLAB AS SOURCE REPOSITORY FOR THE PROJECT\n3. Quickly search for commits for the opened JIRA issue on your Gitlab using a button on the JIRA page.\n4. Quickly search for branch for the opened JIRA issue on your Gitlab using a button on the JIRA page.\n5. Reverse lookup of JIRA issue when a commit page, branch or files tree are opened on Gitlab that may have markers to identify JIRA issue like commit messages or branch names.\n\n\nNOTE: We do not send any of your information outside of the browser.
