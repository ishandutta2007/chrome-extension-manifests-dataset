Sure, I could copy that text, go to Bing, decode it (or more accurately unescape it) and paste it back into the browser, but why do all that clicking if an extension can do it for me?\n\nHere's a typical scenario:\n- I click on a link that's something like: https://referringbutblocked.com/sendmeto=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.randyrants.com%2F\n- I right click on the page and select Decode Current URL\n- Now the URL says: https://referringbutblocked.com/sendmeto=https://www.randyrants.com/\n- I can now cut the front part of the URL and leave the decoded URL\n\n0.0.0.4 moves to Manifest v3 for Extensions."
