When you visit reddit, the MiniReddit extension will reorganize the page to bring the content front and center while removing many of the minor features of the site. If you browse reddit but don't want to open new tabs to see every image, video, or story then MiniReddit is for you. It brings all the content into one page, provides you with the standard upvote/downvote buttons, and gets everything else out of the way. \n\nEach link is given a content box, aligned in a grid, on your homepage. The focus of each content box is on the link title and the content of the link (image, video, text, or otherwise). MiniReddit tries to find the main content of each story for full-size, in-page viewing. If images or videos aren't available, MiniReddit will look for text in the main body of the post. If that can't be found, the top three main-level comments will be loaded so you'll always get the information you're most interested in without having to leave the page.\n\nMiniReddit is a work in progress. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please leave a note in the comments."
