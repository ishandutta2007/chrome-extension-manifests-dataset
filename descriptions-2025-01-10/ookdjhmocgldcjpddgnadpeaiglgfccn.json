The authorship of this masterpiece is attributed to Sri-Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa also known as Veda Vyasa. Today it is considered as one of the most important texts in history of literature and theology as it provides concise guide to Hinduism and a practical self-contained guide to life. During the discourse Sri-Krishna bestows the legendary Vishwaroopa (Vishwa – All, Roopa – form) Dharshana to Arjuna, Lord Hanuman (perched atop Bhima’s Chariot) Sanjaya (using Divya Dhrishti, or divine vision bestowed by vyasa) and Barbarika the son of Ghatotghaja as a boon from Sri-Krishna to prove his divinity. The GITA uses war as an allegory, the world is one HUGE battlefield, the Kurukshethra; the 5 senses are the 5 horses and you are the Jeeva the soul. Let Sri Krishna be your charioteer by leaving the fruits of action to him and fight against greed, lust, anger and ignorance like Dhanajaya (Dhanus – Bow, Jaya – Victor, IE victor of the bow, Arjuna)."
