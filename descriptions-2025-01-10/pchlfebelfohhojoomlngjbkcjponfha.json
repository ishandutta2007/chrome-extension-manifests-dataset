Badge icon text shows the number of captured items.\n\n### Important note ### : Video & Audio Downloader add-on is NOT working for YouTube website or any other YouTube videos embedded in other websites due to Google, YouTube, and Chrome web store policies and restrictions.\n\n### Important note ### : Video & Audio Downloader add-on is NOT responsible for the media content(s) that you download with this add-on. You are responsible for verifying the media's copyright permission before downloading anything from the internet.\n\nTo work with this add-on, simply browse to a website with online media content. Once the media (video or audio) is loaded and played, the addon automatically detects the media and renders it in toolbar popup. Within the popup, you can download media items easily. Moreover, there is also a button to copy the download link to the clipboard.\n\nYou can download all media items at once as a \"zip\" file. Please note that this add-on only shows media items for the active tab (current tab). Once you switch tabs, the list in the popup will be updated.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form in the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/video-audio-downloader.html)."
