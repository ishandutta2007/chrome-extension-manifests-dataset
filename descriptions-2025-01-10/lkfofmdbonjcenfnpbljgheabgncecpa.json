For example, if a professor goes by first name + middle name, it will still be able to find them.\n\n1.0.2 (2021-05-15)\nSmall style changes.\n\n1.0.1 (2021-05-14)\nHovering over a rating now shows expanded details.\n\nNote:\nThough rare, potential \"name clashes\" could occur if two professors at UGA go by the same name in RMP. It will automatically pick the first result if this occurs, so be sure to check the expanded details by hovering over the ratings."
