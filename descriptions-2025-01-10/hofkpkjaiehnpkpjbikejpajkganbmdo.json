Help Ukraine 2022. Any donation you provide helps save Ukraine and Ukrainians. \n\nOur fund supports the Armed Forces of Ukraine through financing purely defence initiatives. In addition to the material support, we increased technological capabilities of the Army through providing 1,500 tablets with Armor software aimed at stopping the artillery. Our foundation also organizes trainings to equip UA military with crucial skills.\n\nOur organization does not use funds for purchasing arms. Our mission is limited to supplying technology, trainings, and accouterments to help save lives of Ukrainians and help our warriors defend Ukraine."
