This simple extension will create a small hovering div with the original post in it when you mouse on to the tiny circular button linking back to a quoted post. The button is located next to the name of the person quoted, and has a chevron on it pointing to the right, like this: (>)\n\nThis is useful for when people are multiquoting, and the original quote is lost. Rather than open the quote in its own tab for context, you can hover over the chevron button to view it. It's also useful for 'fixed' situations where you want to verify what the original post actually said.\n\nv0.3: Added a 'Dismiss' botton to the top of the div, allowing clicks inside the div to work as normal.\n\nv0.2: Removed the limitation of not being able to load the same post twice in a row, as it was causing confusion.\n\nv0.1: This is the first and as such, probably worst version. Let me know what sort of changes and fixes you'd like."
