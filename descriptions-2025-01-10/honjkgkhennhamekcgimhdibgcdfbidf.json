Normally, you need to highlight the whole address, then copy with control+c, command+c, or even with right clicking. That's short, but stll takes time. With this extension, it will do the job for you. Just click the icon on the toolbar, and it will copy the link into your clipboard. It saves a bit of time for you. \nThough the difference is small, many a little makes a mickle! Enjoy."
