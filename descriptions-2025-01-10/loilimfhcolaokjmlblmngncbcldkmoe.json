The tool aims to give testers visual indicators that can help them streamline their attention and focus on elements of interests for further testing without clicking through large numbers of static resources.\n\nIn 1 click, the tool will highlight in yellow all href elements that refer to pages with the potential for dynamic functionality (asp, php, aspx, jsp, jspx, etc.). The tool will also highlight in red all href elements that contain HTTP GET parameters, after identifying these via regular expression. Finally the tool highlights in magenta any input form elements that result in dynamic HTTP POST requests. This should ideally assist penetration testers in focusing quickly on elements of interest for further investigation.\n\nIf you want to have the functionality running continuously, simply select the INFINITE MODE checkbox and press the FIRE button. The plugin will automatically perform targeting during navigation until the checkbox is deselected by the user.\n\nThe tool is equally useful for reconnaissance on search results page to visually identify interesting endpoints containing the aforementioned properties."
