Archiving a chat removes it from the view, but keeps searchable so that your messages aren't lost, but you get to remove clutter. There is no way to bulk archive conversations on Facebook messenger currently, so this removes the hassle of having to manually click through each conversation to archive it.\n\nYou should install this extension and if:\n\n- You dislike the clutter of having a lot of messages in your app\n- You chat too much, and want to make it harder for yourself to message others\n- You want to clean up years of conversations without having to manually archive\n\nTo run the extension, simply install it and then click on it when on messenger.com. That will trigger a pop-up with the buttons to bulk archive. You may have to refresh messenger for it to work."
