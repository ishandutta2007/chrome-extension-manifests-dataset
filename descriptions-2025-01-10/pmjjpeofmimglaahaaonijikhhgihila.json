Articles are rated from -100 to 100 with -100 being as Conservative as possible, 100 being as Liberal as possible, and 0 being completely neutral. This extension is not meant to support or degrade any news source or political leaning, but give insight into the keywords being used to lead readers a certain direction.\n\nInternalize your insight into bias by creating an account and tracking your browsing history. By analyzing the leanings of the sources you read most, your own biases will be brought to light and open for honest interpretation.\n\nPrivacy Policy: Downloading this extension and creating an account WILL track your browsing history. Any web pages that trigger a political bias rating will be recorded along with the time of access so you can observe your history over time. This extension can be uninstalled or logged out of at any time to prevent further tracking of data. The requirements for creating an account are simply a username, email, and password, all of which are encrypted using the SHA512 standard and HTTPS certificates, and deleted on removal of an account."
