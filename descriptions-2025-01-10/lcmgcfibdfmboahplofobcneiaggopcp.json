Save the meh. Save the whole internet in your pocket. Introducing Dumpster – a lightweight way to save and share links.\n\nUse our Chrome extension to save things you find on the web to your Dumpster account from the toolbar of your browser.\n\n★ Save all the things!\nDon’t fret, just save. We’ve created the easiest way for you to keep anything and everything for later. To make it even easier on ya, Dumpster is available for iOS and as Chrome and Safari extensions. Learn more about our apps here.\n\n★ Lists for you and your friends\nRecipes, memes, apartment listings, you name it. Create lists for anything you can think of and share ‘em with just one click.\n\n★ Find your findings\nWe all forget things. But your Dumpster library won’t. We have one of those magnifying glasses. Or as they more formally say, contextual search.\n\n★ Turn out the lights\nDark mode is pretty nice on the eyes. So we said, “hey, how about we add Dark Mode to all of our apps.” And to that we said, “great idea let’s do it.”"
