Grade Tracker: This graph monitors your grade by recording changes when you visit the course grade page. It updates if it is a different day and your grade changed. It also lets you know how much your grade went up or down from the last time you checked (need at least 2 saved grades).\n\n2. Quartile Grade Calculation: This calculates the course grade based on quartiles (upper quartile, median, and lower quartile). For example, the upper quartile considers the upper quartile scores across all assignments and calculates the grade as if a student achieved the upper quartile on every assignment\n\n3.

It provides an organized view of your assignments with a donut chart.\n\n‚ÄìIMPROVEMENTS AND MORE TO COME!
