Technology is not sufficiently advanced so as to perfectly identify which content should be blocked. Therefore, the only secure option is a whitelist. \n\nThis extension works by removing all image and video content from every page you visit. Websites can then be selectively added to a whitelist. When a site is on the whitelist, images and videos are visible on that site. When adding sites to the whitelist, there is a 24 hour cooldown period before the site is actually added. Pending sites will be listed in yellow."
