Do end up with many duplicate tabs as a result? Favitabs shows all your tabs at a glance, organised by favicon and title. It works both as a replacement for the new tab page and as a pop-up which you can set to whatever key combination you like. It also lets you quickly search for tabs by title and navigate them using the keyboard.\n\nFavitabs does not request unnecessary permissions and does not have access to page content. It does not spy on you and send information to any server. It does not include any ads."
