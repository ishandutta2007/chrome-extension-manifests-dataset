This is a great way to find vulnerabilities for free while you browse.\n\nFor example, if example.com includes expired-domain-name.info via a <script> tag, this extension will detect that.\n\nFor this extension to work it performs DNS NS queries to all base domains of all sub-resources of pages you browse. If the request results in an NXDOMAIN/SERVFAIL/REFUSED response then the domain is considered potentially vulnerable. This is done via Google's DNS-over-HTTPS public server. If you're not comfortable using Google to perform these DNS validations, this extension is not for you.\n\nNot that false-positives can occur, please use the \"Confirm this result on...\" buttons to validate the initial DNS findings."
