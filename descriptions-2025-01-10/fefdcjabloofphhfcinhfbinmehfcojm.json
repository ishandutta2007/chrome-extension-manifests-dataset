First click on one of the timers (anywhere beside notes) and input your time.\n  Examples:\n   To set 15 minutes: 15. or 1500 (00:15:00)\n   To set 72 hours (3 days): 72.. or 3... (3 00:00:00)\n   To set 3 hours and 45 minutes: 345. or 3.45. (03:45:00)\n   To set 90 seconds (1:30): 90 or 1.30 (00:01:30)\n\nFixes:\n * Fixed keyboard input not registering\n\nFeatures:\n * Tricky input (still working on it)\n * (new ) TTS for notes\n * (new) Shortcuts on badge timer\n * (new) Options to set different sound alarms and volume\n * (new) Notification alert (optional)\n * (new) Multiple colour themes\n * Multiple timers \n * High range of spans with up to several years\n * Count up like stopwatch (to start, set the timer from 00:00:00)\n * Optimised for extensive use\n * Display timer one the icon badge\n * Set and navigate the timers with keyboard\n * Set timer with scroll wheel\n * Custom notes for each countdown\n\nP.S. Rate the extension and spread the word to encourage the developer (me) to dedicate more time in implementing more features."
