Consequently, it wasn’t enough for us, the makers of Allyable, to give only businesses the means to make their websites accessible, so we created Self-Service Accessibility for end users.\n\nAs with everything we do, Allyable’s self-service offering is simple.  We have made a Chrome extension available through the Chrome Web Store at a very affordable cost.  Users may purchase the extension, and once installed and activated, they can make any site accessible, even if the site has no built-in accessibility features. It doesn’t get much easier."
