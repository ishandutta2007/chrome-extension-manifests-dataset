You do not need to subscribe to them on YouTube itself. No shorts, no posts, and no polls. \n\nThe extension is a perfect solution for the channels that you want to watch for educational purposes. Many channels spam with shorts that are often cut from their longer videos and don't contain much useful information. With Value Feed, you fix this and take back control of what you watch. \n\nHere is how it works: \n\n1. Install the extension. \n2. Register via email and password. \n3. Click on the added button under the videos to add the channel to your feed. \n4. That's itâ€”you will receive an email at most once per day if any of your channels upload a long-format video. \n5. Enjoy having links to your videos without flooding the subscription page. \n6. Leave emails as \"unread\" as a reminder to watch the videos later."
