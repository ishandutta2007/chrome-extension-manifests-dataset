This can make Python code, especially, difficult to review, when it incorrectly looks like the indent level has changed, or obscures the fact that the indent level has changed.\n\nThis extension simply adds a bit of extra CSS on github pages that makes the wrap occur at the first character that exceeds the width of the view, rather than moving \"words\" (which are often entire lines of code).\n\nSome issues reported about the default behavior:\nhttps://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/45559\nhttps://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/42298#discussioncomment-4725465\n\nNote, the bookmarklet solution in that second link unwraps lines entirely, which some people may find preferable, but with long lines it can cause a mess of overlapped text. This extension, on the other hand, makes the content stay within the pane width, and wraps like vim's default behavior."
