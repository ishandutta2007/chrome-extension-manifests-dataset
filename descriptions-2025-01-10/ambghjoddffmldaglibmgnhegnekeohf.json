It also notifies you if coupons are available for the site that you are currently at and gives you the coupon codes.\n\nSince we search multiple sources in parallel, we are usually able to find better prices than you would by going to a price comparison search engine directly.  In addition, ShopDAQ does not require you to change your shopping habits; in our tests, it recognized most mass produced products on major shopping sites in the US, UK, Canada, and Germany, and often found lower cost sources for identical items.\n\nOur extension only appears when it finds competitive prices or coupons for products or sites that you are viewing.\n\n(Currently works in the US, UK, Canada, France, and Germany; other countries coming soon.)"
