If you click mouse frequently when you are playing game or working, this application can release your finger and save your time.\n\nYou will simply need to press one specific HotKey, and GS Auto Clicker will then help you finish clicking, the application even lets you record sequences of clicks on different parts of the screen to be used over and over. From the Options menu, you can select which mouse button to use and also select single or double clicks. The application can also be set to continue clicking until it's stopped or to click just a certain number of times, and you can adjust the interval between clicks."
