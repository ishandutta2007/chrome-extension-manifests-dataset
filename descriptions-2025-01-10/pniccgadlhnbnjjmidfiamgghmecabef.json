Version 2.0\n----------------------------\n(Scroll down for changelog.)\n\nThis extension fetches the newest videos from Yogscast.com AND notifies you when new videos get posted. Currently it looks for new videos every 10 minutes and the icon of the extension  lets you know when new videos are available. Clicking the icon will show a little popup with the newest videos. New videos for you are colored specially for easy recognition.\n\nIt's possible to select which channels are shown. You can also launch the video with a single click right; a new tab with the video on Yogscast.com will be opened.\n\nChangelog:\n--\n2.0.1 \n* FIX: Fix to actually show the \"new\" text in the icon\n* CHANGE: The number of new videos is now displayed in the icon instead of just \"NEW\"\n\n--\nDisclaimer: This addon is in no way affiliated or endorsed by The Yogscast.
