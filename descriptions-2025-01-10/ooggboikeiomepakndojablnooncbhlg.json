But what about when you need to find a time that works for specific guests? The When2Meet Intersector finds the intersection of the guests you select and clearly marks on the calendar when they can meet. \n\nYou can select how long your meetings are and how much of that meeting you'd like your guests to be available for. For example, scheduling a 1-hour meeting may be difficult with 10 people, but you can find a block of 60 minutes during which everyone can come for at least 30 minutes."
