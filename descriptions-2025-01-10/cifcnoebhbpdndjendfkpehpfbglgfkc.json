This extension restores the scrollbars to the native Windows 7 appearance, including restoring the arrow buttons.\n\n\n\n*** FAQs and Common Problems ***\n\n* Why does Chrome warn that Win7 Scrollbars can \"access my data on all websites\"?  Are you tracking me?\n\nNo.\n\nWin7 Scrollbars does NOT \"access your data,\" do any tracking, talk to any servers, or do any other nefarious thing you can think of.  It is implemented in 100% CSS; it contains no JavaScript; and it does not access any external resources.\n\nIt does only one thing: restyle the scrollbars.  And it does that entirely locally, on your computer.\n\nChrome is providing this warning because CSS is technically able to do other things, such as add and remove content from pages that you view.  Win7 Scrollbars doesn't do that, but Chrome has no way of knowing that, so it provides the warning out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\n* This doesn't work with drop-down menus.\n\nThat's correct. As far as I know, it is not possible to fix these with an extension.\n\n\n* This doesn't work with URLs beginning with chrome://, with Chrome's built-in PDF viewer, or with Chrome's developer tools.\n\nUnfortunately, extensions do not have access to these areas of Chrome.\n\n\n* This doesn't work with URLs beginning with file://.\n\nIt does ... but you have to enable it.  Open Chrome's menu and go to Tools / Extensions, or simply type chrome://extensions in the address bar.  Look for Win7 Scrollbars, and check the box that says \"Allow access to file URLs.\"\n\n\n* This doesn't work in Chrome's incognito mode.\n\nIt does ... but you have to enable it.  Open Chrome's menu and go to Tools / Extensions, or simply type chrome://extensions in the address bar.  Look for Win7 Scrollbars, and check the box that says \"Allow in incognito.\""
