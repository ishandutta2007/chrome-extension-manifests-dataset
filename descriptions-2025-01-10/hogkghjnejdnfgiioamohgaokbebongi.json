By using this extension CSpeak will be able to detect and interact with web based text controls at the point of the cursor.\n\nCSpeak is a cloud-based voice recognition solution designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare providers by allowing them to quickly document their patient charts and perform standardized tasks in a fraction of the time normally needed to do so.\n\n[24.12.18]\nThis version includes changes to work with recent updates in Athena Clinicals. Specifically controls that didn't return a full set of properties back to the CSpeak client.\n\n[23.5.8]\nThis version adapts the extension to work with the new version of the Athena Slate Editor. \n\n[23.4.12]\nThis version has new functionality to help provide more stability in the HST EMR. Additional improvements have been made for web apps that perform any form of partial content loading. \n\n[23.2.10]\nThis version has new functionality inside of Froala text editors. This is based on the latest version of the text editor as of 2/1/2023. Additionally improvements have been made to ensure that requests are only sent to tabs that have fully loaded the extension. If a tab fails to load the extension in time for a request, the request will be ignored.\n\n[22.12.12]\nThis version expands on the functionality provided in v22.12.12 and increases compatibility with the new Slate JS text fields found in the document editor.\n\n[22.12.12]\nThe version is focused on advancing the integration between CSpeak v22 and the Athena One document editor. Please note that some fields in Athena One have changed recently (e.g. Assessment and Patient Goals) and the extension will be updated in the near future to accommodate those fields."
