This is underlined when they're \"new to me\".\n\nThe Classrooms tab expands to make full use of your browser's width, for improved clarity.  Various abbreviations are made and the original screen is altered very slightly for a more compact presentation.\n\nThe PreVIP (Level One) song buttons are displayed before class, (when they're actually useful).\n\nSee http://WantMy.info/Pet for more information.\n\nNote: I do not represent VIPKID management in ANY form or fashion! I'm just a teacher, like you, trying to make things better for all of us."
