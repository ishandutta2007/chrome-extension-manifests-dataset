Keyboard shortcuts for navigation are arranged like the common arrow keys.\n\nNo ads, no spyware.\n\nThe pointer can be moved to nearby links by pressing the up, down, left and right keys. Keyboard Surfing automatically selects nearby links on the page. \n\nThree sets of shortcut keys are provided for navigation and control: the numpad set, the left-hand set and the right-hand set. \n\nAdditional functions include: smooth scrolling, open links in new tab and in new window, close windows and tabs, go to homepage.\n\n*NOTE* Chrome has some alarmist messaging around the permissions that Keyboard Surfing needs to run. Don't be alarmed. Keyboard Surfing needs to inspect every page you visit (to find links), therefore it must be able to read all the pages you visit.  Keyboard Surfing needs to inject a few elements into web pages (the javascript code, the cursor, the red box and the help screen). Any other parts of the visited page will remain unmodified. Keyboard Surfing does not log, store, or transmit to anyone any of your data or the data about web pages you visit. Keyboard Surfing does not send any data at all.\n\n**********NOTE**********\n- Press 'Pause' key on keyboard to enable or disable this extension.\n- This extension is available for Chrome and Firefox browsers.\n\nRight-handed keyset:\n\ti, k      up, down\n\tj, l       left, right\n\tu         scroll up\n\tm        scroll down\n\ty         scroll up half page\n\tb         scroll down half page\n\th         open a link in the current tab or window\n\tn         open a link in a new tab or window\n\t0         new browser window\n\tp         show the help page for a list of all keys \n\tspace    smooth scrolling mode\n\nNumpad keyset:\n\t8, 5          up, down\n\t4, 6          left, right\n\t7              scroll up\n\t1              scroll down\t\n\tn.Enter      open a link in the current tab or window\n\tn.plus       open a link in a new tab or window\t\n\t2              go back in history\n\t3              go forward in history\n\tn.multiply   new browser window\n\tdecimal      show the help page for a list of all keys \n\t0            smooth scroling mode\n\nOnly the most common commands are listed.
