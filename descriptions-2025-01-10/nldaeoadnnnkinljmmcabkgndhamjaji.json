This feature allows you to efficiently categorize your boards, making it easier to keep track of different projects and access important information quickly. Whether you’re managing multiple boards or collaborating with a team, this extension helps streamline your workspace, providing easy access to your organized boards and improving overall productivity.\n\nMeet User Demands\nResponding to valuable feedback from our community, this extension addresses a crucial user need: the ability to organize your Ziteboard boards into custom folders. With this feature, you can create dedicated folders for each student or project, neatly grouping related boards (such as lessons) within those folders. This is especially useful for private tutors who may need to manage multiple students, each with their own set of lesson boards.\nMoreover, as users accumulate more boards over time, which can easily exceed 1000 in some cases, effective organization becomes essential. The ability to group boards into folders helps maintain clarity and efficiency, ensuring that you can quickly access and manage your boards. This enhancement not only simplifies your workflow but also ensures that you can quickly access and organize your boards, ultimately boosting productivity and improving the overall user experience.\n\nWhat is Ziteboard?\nZiteboard (https://ziteboard.com) stands out as an exceptional online whiteboard tool, providing a versatile digital workspace for brainstorming, teaching, and collaborative projects. Its features include an infinite canvas for limitless creativity, real-time collaboration for dynamic teamwork, and advanced vector graphics for precise visualizations. With robust tools for video chat and PDF integration, Ziteboard caters to diverse professional and educational needs. This extension enhances Ziteboard by making board management more intuitive, allowing you to focus on what matters most—your ideas and collaboration.\n\nLooking Ahead\nThe current version of the extension allows you to organize boards into folders, and we are considering adding support for subfolders in future updates. While this feature is not yet available, we are always exploring ways to enhance your experience. We value your input and encourage you to share your thoughts and suggestions in the reviews. Your feedback helps us prioritize future improvements and ensures that we continue to meet your needs.",
    "de,es,fr,ru": "Ziteboard is the best zoomable online whiteboard for collaboration on any desktop or mobile device.\n\nExplain, sketch, teach anything. Design layouts, workflows, prototypes. Extend video conferences with visual teamwork: discussions, meetings, daily presentations, online training, tutoring or even mind mapping.\n\nUse bold colors on zoomable boards with intelligent line smoothing and see how great you express yourself visually. Feel confident while drawing. Turn on shape recognition and expect perfect circles and rectangles to appear. If you need words, just click and type. Drag an image directly from the web (max. 4MB) or your own computer (max. 500kB).\n\nHave your boards customized, pick colors, get a unique domain or embed fantastic zoomable boards to your website or blog. Ziteboard is ready for all your ideas, so share them with anyone you wish via email or social media. Don’t be concerned about data security - SSL protection and private boards are at your service.\n\nCollaborate, brainstorm and start seeing the big picture together with others in real time. Shared whiteboards are regularly used by public speakers, freelancers, designers, developers, teachers, tutors and even creative agencies. Ziteboarding makes discussions more effective and improves communication. It's great in complementing both PowerPoint and Prezi presentations and it adds a lot to Scrum as well."
