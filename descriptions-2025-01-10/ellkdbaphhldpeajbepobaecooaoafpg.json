It encrypts your private keys and mnemonics (using scrypt) and stores it locally on your device, so neither Fetch nor the websites you visit have access to these sensitive data. \n\nSome of the wallet's features include: \n - Support for the Fetch (to be ASI Alliance) blockchain as well as other cosmos-based ledgers (e.g. Osmosis, Juno, â€¦)\n - Check out transaction history and governance voting history in the activity section\n - Group Support: Wallet now offers group support, allowing users to collaborate and communicate more efficiently.\n - Notifications: Stay up-to-date with important information and updates.\n - Fetch Bot and Automation:  Fetch Bot, is a powerful tool that automates tasks and simplifies repetitive actions.\n - Support for multiple accounts: Create new accounts, Import existing ones or sign in with google.\n - Connect your existing hardware wallet\n - Send and receive tokens\n - Transfer tokens using the IBC protocol\n - Staking on the Fetch ledger (Add stake and Claim your rewards) and other supported chains\n - Recover native accounts on the Fetch main-net which were migrated from Ethereum accounts used to stake ERC20 FET\n - Address Book for easy access to frequently used accounts\n - Ability to view and revoke Authz grants\n - Wallet Access Permissions: lists all websites that have wallet permission.\n - Chain List Access: lists all websites that have chain list permission.\n - Auto-Lock Timer: By default set to 0 means it will work in the same way that it currently works but if we put a timer to X min then it will Auto lock after X min)\n- View and vote on governance proposals directly from the wallet"
