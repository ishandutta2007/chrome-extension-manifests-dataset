Perfect for designers, UX researchers, and web developers, this extension helps you understand how users might visually navigate and focus on various elements of a page.\n\nKey Features:\nF-Pattern Overlay:\nSimulates the common F-shaped scanning pattern that users often follow when reading or viewing content. This overlay helps visualize how attention is primarily focused on the top and left side of the page.\n\nZ-Pattern Overlay:\nSimulates the Z-shaped gaze path, showing how users tend to scan across the top, diagonally through the middle, and down to the bottom of the page, often used for pages with important visual elements spread across the layout.\n\nCenter Bias Overlay:\nHighlights the central area of the page to simulate center bias, where users are naturally more drawn to the middle of the screen, especially on large monitors or when content is focused in the center.\n\n3x3 Grid Overlay:\nDisplays a 3x3 grid to help visualize how the screen is divided into zones. This helps you understand where users' eyes might land based on typical reading patterns and attention distribution.\n\nAdditional Features:\nEasy-to-Use Toolbar:\nToggle overlays on and off with a simple click from a sleek and customizable toolbar that can be moved around the screen.\n\nInteractive Tooltips:\nGet helpful tips on each overlay, explaining their significance and typical usage.\n\nPerfect For:\nUX/UI designers looking to optimize page layouts\nWeb developers conducting user behavior studies\nDigital marketers aiming to improve ad placements and content visibility\nDownload the Gaze Simulator Toolbar today and gain a better understanding of how your audience interacts with your content!"
