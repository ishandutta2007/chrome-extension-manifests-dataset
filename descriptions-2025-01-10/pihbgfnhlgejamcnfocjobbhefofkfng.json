So I need to copy each ticker one-by-one, and manually check eToro on whether they exist or not. \n\nMy Solution\n\nAnytime you're on the Finviz Stock Screener, you can open up this extension, it'll automatically highlight all the tickers on Finviz that actually exist on eToro. \n\nThis way, you don't ever have to waste time switching between tabs just to check if a particular stock exists. In turn, you can make quicker decisions. \n\nHere's how it works: \n\n1. Once you've installed the extension, head on over to Finviz's Stock Screener. \n2. Set your parameters, and wait for Finviz to give you a list of stocks. \n3. Simply open the extension, and it will automatically highlight all the stocks that exist in eToro. \n4. You can even click on the \"Open in eToro\" link on Finviz or the View icon on the extension itself, to open up the stock on Etoro right away. \n\nIt's just that simple. Give this extension a shot, and let me know what you think :)"
