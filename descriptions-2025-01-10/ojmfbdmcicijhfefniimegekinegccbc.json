With Wishgenie installed youâ€™ll never miss a donation again!\nYou can shop at any of your favourite retailers such as Amazon, John Lewis, Debenhams or Play.com and they will donate a percentage of anything you spend to your chosen good cause at no cost to you! Wishgenie works with 280,000 UK charities and 32,000 schools.\nOn average the retailer will donate 3.5% of anything you spend online to your chosen cause, but with some items such as insurance, holidays or clothes the donations can be much higher.
