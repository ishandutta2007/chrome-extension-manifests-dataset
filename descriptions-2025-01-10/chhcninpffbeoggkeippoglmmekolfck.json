Use this app to easily record timesheets while you're browsing. Simply login with your existing ChronoSheets account to get started.\n\nYou can switch between jobs & tasks, update your profile and edit timesheet entries you've already created with any of the ChronoSheets apps. If you're always using the browser while you work, this extension is super convenient - you won't have to change to a different window to record your timesheets. Just tap the extension icon to manage your timesheets.\n\nUsing the timer is really easy, simply choose your job code & task, then start the timer. If you need to switch to a different task, simply select the task and click \"switch\" - the timesheet entries will be automatically created as you do this."
