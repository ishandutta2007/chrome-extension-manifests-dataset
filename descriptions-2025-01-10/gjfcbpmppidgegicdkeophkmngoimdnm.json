With the growing concerns around data privacy, especially under regulations like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), it’s essential for businesses to maintain transparency about the cookies they use. Cookies—small files stored on users’ devices—can carry sensitive data, track user behavior, and facilitate authentication processes.\n\nWhat's My Cookie is designed to help organizations and developers better understand the nature of these cookies. This application makes it easy to quickly scan and categorize cookies according to their function, enabling teams to make informed decisions about data management and user privacy.\n\n\nKey Features of What's My Cookie\n\n\n1. Cookie Identification and Categorization \n\nQuickly detects and categorizes website cookies into types such as:\n\n- Functional: Essential for website functionality.\n- Security: Protect user data and prevent fraudulent use of login credentials.\n- Analytics: Understand how users interact with the website.\n- Marketing: used for tracking and collecting visitor behavior and displaying targeted ads.\n- Personalization: Tailoring the user experience based on preferences.\n\n\n2.
