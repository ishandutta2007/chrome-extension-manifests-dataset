As a result, we are constantly bombarded with enticing thumbnails and ads from all directions. While this works for those looking to pass the time, it's less ideal for anyone aiming to concentrate on educational content, conduct research, or simply enjoy some relaxing music.\n\nAfter using DF UTube for a few days, you begin to notice how deeply the cycle of clicking, watching, mindlessly scanning for another video, clicking, and watching again has been ingrained in us by YouTube™'s design. DF UTube helps to break that pattern.\n\nBy default, DF UTube turns off autoplay, hides the recommendations sidebar and the related videos at the end of each video, and removes the grid of suggested videos from your homepage. All of these settings can be customized. It also allows you to hide comments and disable playlists across the site.\n\nI hope DF UTube helps you focus on the content you want to engage with. Try it out, and feel free to share any feedback or report bugs!\n\nNOT WORKING? Feel free to reach out by email (you can find my contact information below). YouTube™ may occasionally update its interface, which could cause DF UTube to malfunction.\n\nABOUT PRIVACY I do not access, review, or track your browsing history or any personal data. The only permissions I request are \"tabs\" to enable functionality and \"storage\" to save your settings.\n\nThis extension is compatible with Manifest V3.\n\nCredits goes to calkuta for the original extension idea."
