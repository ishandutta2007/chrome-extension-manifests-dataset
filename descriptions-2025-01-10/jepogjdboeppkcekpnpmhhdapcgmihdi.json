For any problems, please drop an email to shaohua at gmail.com.\n\nUPDATE v2.7 (8/2022)\nRemoved an unused and unnecessary permission \"tabs\".\n\nUPDATE v2.6 (2/2018)\nSome users report errors like \"your connection is not private\". The redirected URL has been set to use http connections always. (Sorry the update v2.4 on 1/2018 was buggy.)\n\nUPDATE v2.3 (6/2013)\nRemoved a feature (which behaves like a bug): if you press the button with some text selected on the page, Google will be invoked to query that text.\n\nIMPORTANT UPDATE to v2.2 (6/2013)\n***************************\nChanged the manifest file to conform with the new format requirement. \n\n功能：打开主要的几个数据库上的文章页面时候，会自动重定向，使用NTU学术代理打开全文。如果不能自动定位，则请点击工具栏的NTU Logo, 插件会作重定向，使用NTU学术代理打开全文。\n\nIf the automatic redirection doesn't work, you can still use it in the old way: click the \"NTU logo\" on the extension tool bar and the current web page will be \"proxified\".\n\nA twist: since the fancier functionality of this new version requires more rights of your browser, when you are upgrading from the old version, Chrome's security policy will disable this extension automatically. You can just safely re-enable it.\n\n如果你已经安装旧版本，在chrome里边\"update extensions now\"后，会提示新版本需要更多权限，因此被禁用。然后Re-enable就行了\n\nFor some major academic databases, such as \"sciencedirect.com\" and \"wiley.com\", the extension redirects your browser to the full text immediately. For other major academic databases, including \"ieeexplore.ieee.org\", \"acm.org\" and \"springerlink.com\", the extension redirects your browser on request: only when you click the \"Download PDF\" or \"Purchase/Buy\" link on that page, will this extension redirect (shown in the screenshots). \n\nIn either case, you will be asked to log in to your NTU account first, if you haven't.\n\n****************** EXAMPLE ******************\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4597201\n\nFirst the extension will redirect the above link to:\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezlibproxy1.ntu.edu.sg/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4597201\n\nIn the second page, you can download its citation, but the fulltext is unavailable.\nSo you need to click the \"Purchase Now\" button below \"Access the Full Text\" and this extension will intercept the click and redirect the browser (please allow 3-5 seconds for its loading) to \nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezlibproxy1.ntu.edu.sg/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597201&tag=1\nand now you get the PDF fulltext.\n\nMost academic databases work well, except for \"ieeexplore.ieee.org\". It often leads to an \"invalid cookie\" page in the first use after you logged in. Don't worry: You just need to go back to the initial link, and click on \"Purchase Now\" for the 2nd time, usually the error will disappear.\n\nIf the automatic redirection doesn't work (that means, this academic database isn't specially treated by our automatic mechanism), you fall back on the old usage: click the NTU logo on the toolbar, and this extension redirects you to an address whose domain is appended with \".ezlibproxy1.ntu.edu.sg\". If this academic database is purchased by NTU library, in most cases you gain access to the full text now. If the database is not purchased, NTU library will tell you this is an invalid address.\n\nHope this extension makes your academic life a little bit easier :-D"
