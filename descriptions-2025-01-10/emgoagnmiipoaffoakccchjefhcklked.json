Use this in conjunction with the Attribute Tester (more about that below) to see how the UI looks with various attribute values.\n* Test your device attributes: Before you publish, you can open the Attribute Tester for your device. Change the values to see the effect on both the mobile app UI and your device.\n* Specify Bluetooth advertising interval: From the Device Type window, you can now set the latency of your device's advertising interval. The longer the interval, the lower the power requirement on your device's battery. Optimize for your device. \n* Input attributes can be set as a latch: When you set a GPIO input attribute to operate as a latch, it will store a value until the value can be successfully transmitted to the Afero Cloud. This is handy for holding, then reporting, a sensor state change even when the state has gone back to normal.\n* Bind the value of one attribute to another: When you set one attribute to bind to another, any bound attribute value change is immediately propagated to the binding attribute. This feature is useful when you have independent ways to change a given state of a device."
