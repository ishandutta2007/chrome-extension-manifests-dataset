Everything. It's up to you to build your very customized whitelist of domains you trust. Everything else is blocked and well kept out of your browser.\n\nIt's like AdBlock the other way around, completely.\n\n🚀 Hide ads\n  ⭐️ by blocking advertisement domains you're free of the most of those pervasive ads\n\n🚀 Avoid tracking\n  ⭐️ by blocking tracking domains you're protected from services which acquire information about your browsing behaviour\n\n🚀 Load pages faster\n  ⭐️ by blocking unnecessary domains (requests) you save a lot of traffic and make pages loading faster!\n\n🚀 Fight procrastination\n  ⭐️ just add facebook.com to the blocklist and... do more!\n\n🚀 Permissions explained\n  ⭐️ \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\": to be able to intercept HTTP request before they leave your browser\n\nCompletely free and with no ads\n\nMade with ♥ by Peta Sittek"
