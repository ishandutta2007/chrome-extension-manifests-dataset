The extension does only one thing -- allows you to sort your Goodreads' books in a drag and drop fashion, saving your time and nerves on waiting for yet-another page refresh or trying to line-up the numerical order in your head. It's especially useful for organizing large read-lists (mine is still greater than have-read one).\n\nCurrently seems stable enough, but do mind that it was created in one evening, so all the bug reports are greatly appreciated. (You can contact me directly at wolvendev@gmail.com or through feedback form on marketplace). But please double-check with FAQ on extension popup in advance."
