As a sighted person, it's difficult to tell what alt-text an image has (though an image with alt-text is decorated with an [ALT] overlay, one cannot simply view the alt-text) and not always immediately obvious when an image is missing alt-text, for those who would like help in making the web more inclusive.\n\nThis extension is a little experimental, but works. YMMV."
