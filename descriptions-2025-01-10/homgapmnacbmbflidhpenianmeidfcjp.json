These pages are designed to load quickly and offer a simplified user experience. As a side benefit, for alternative streamlined pages, PageAccel saves bandwidth.\n\nFor users who prefer to use the standard (non-accelerated version) of pages on a given website, switching to the standard form is as easy as clicking the PageAccel (lightning) button in the url bar to switch back to the standard pages for that website. Just as easily, users can switch back at any time.\n\nPageAccel is a free, community-driven open source project.\n\n***\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSome websites provide alternative, streamlined versions of their pages called AMP (accelerated mobile pages). These pages are created to load faster and provide simplified content for both desktop and mobile users alike. When PageAccel detects that a page has an AMP version, it switches to use it.\n\nPageAccel does *not* create any of its content, nor does it alter pages by itself. Any page content that you see when using PageAccel is generated by the page author itself."
