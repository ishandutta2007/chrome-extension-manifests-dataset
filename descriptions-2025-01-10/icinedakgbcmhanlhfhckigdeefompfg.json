The list of possible words are shown on the left side of a screen.\n\nPlease note that the extension uses a different dictionary. Some suggestion words might be not able to answer. In that case, please try another word in the suggestion list.\n\n## Change logs\n\n- 1.1.5: Support the nytime URL, fix the hint show even in hidden state when only one word left."
