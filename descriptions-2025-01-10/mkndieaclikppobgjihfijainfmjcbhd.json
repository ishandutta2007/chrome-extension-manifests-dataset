Unfortunately, the B*onic Reader company are very strict with their tRaDeMaRk ðŸ˜’ so I have made my own version which is NOT the same concept and is instead an innovation of the idea.\n\nMy WebExtension allows for users to enable easier reading on ANY website (see below for an example on the Open Source Redhat article). Simply click the button and transform almost all the text on your pages with the new BiReader format! Emphasizing the starts of words, BiReader helps you read faster and easier than ever before!\n\nAdditionally, options for fixation, saccade, opacity, and font weight have been added in a neat menu, easily accessible through the menu -- accessed by simply clicking on the extension icon."
