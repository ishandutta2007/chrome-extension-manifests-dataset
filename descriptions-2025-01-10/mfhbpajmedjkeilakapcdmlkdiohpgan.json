Unfortunately, that can lead to implicit bias, causing you to miss otherwise qualified candidates.\n\nLinkedInonymous helps overcome implicit bias by hiding or anonymizing parts of a LinkedIn profile or search.\n\nCurrently, LinkedInonymous will:\n- Remove profile pictures\n- Change names to one of the star constellations in order to anonymize them.\n- Toggle the anonymizing on or off by tapping the extension button\n\nWhy constellations? I wanted something that sounded enough like real names without triggering bias. Using scientific tree names was the other idea. Do you have a suggestion? I'd love to hear it.\n\nVersion history:\n1.0.1 - Bug fixes causing linkedIN to hang\n1.0.0 - Initial version"
