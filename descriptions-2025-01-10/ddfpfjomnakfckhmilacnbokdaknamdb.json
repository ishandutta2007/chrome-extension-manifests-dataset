This has the advantage, that no advertising or popups are shown when trying to interact with the video (playing, skipping, ...) or some sites are showing them even if you do nothing. Additionally this enables you to download the video by right-clicking it and just choose the download option.\n\nBecause of some limitations Chrome forces to extensions, not all features the extension can offer are available on Chrome (hence the \"Lite\" suffix in the name)."
