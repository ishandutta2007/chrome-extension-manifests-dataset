And all the income from the SBT will be share 10% to the \"Share\" NFT holders.\n\nThis solution makes the NFT industry healthier, as NFT not only has some images but consumable content that have profit, the profit gets shared with the NFT shareholders.\nWe provide a Chrome extension that injects relative widgets onto Twitter web pages to help Twitter web user to make the action much easier. This also helps our platform can siphon traffic."
