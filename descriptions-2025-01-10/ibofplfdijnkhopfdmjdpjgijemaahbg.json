But if the Times changes any of the layout on those pages, it could stop working. Oh well. \n\n(Full disclosure: I'm a tremendous fan of the New York Times' journalism! In fact, I *write* for the New York Times Magazine. But the needle... sue me, it gives me the jitters.)\n\nNote: The terrific needle icon I used in this extension is a Creative-Commons-licensed graphic by Untashable, available here: https://thenounproject.com/term/injection-needle/1667672/"
