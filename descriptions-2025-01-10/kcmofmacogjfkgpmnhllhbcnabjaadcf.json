If you are up for a challenge, select the difficult setting to practice with larger and more complex numbers. Space has been provided on the right side of the popup to write out your work if necessary. \n\n\nBackground:\nA BCG consultant once advised that the best way to prepare for the math portion of case interviews is to practice math randomly throughout the day. An issue I encountered when doing this was that I would easily become distracted when opening a new window or app and end up on Netflix or Instagram. Consulting Math was created so that you can practice math without leaving the page you are on. If you are ever surfing the web and are suddenly inspired to do some of this practice, you can now easily click on this extension and get it done. Space is provided to do work, and you can even track your performance by seeing how many you can answer correctly in a row.\n\nBest of luck prepping!"
