With a specific focus on the functionality of the extension, this extension is designed to be a reliable and efficient solution to ensure that dbmigration files are properly managed and do not cause any conflicts in a codebase.\n\nWhen a pull request is created on Bitbucket, the Dbmigration Checker extension performs an automatic check to detect any potential conflicts in dbmigration files between the source and destination branches. This functionality is essential because dbmigration files must be run sequentially and should not have conflicting numbers. If conflicting files are detected, the extension updates the UI to notify users of the issue, providing them with the necessary information to resolve the conflict before merging.\n\nThe extension makes API calls to the Bitbucket server and accesses the necessary resources to retrieve data about pull requests and dbmigration files. With the use of scripting permissions, the extension is able to modify the UI of the Bitbucket website, providing users with valuable information about the potential conflicts in their dbmigration files. This is crucial in preventing pipeline failures and ensuring the smooth operation of a codebase.\n\nFurthermore, the Dbmigration Checker extension is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, providing users with an easy-to-use interface that seamlessly integrates with their workflow. There is no need for users to manually check dbmigration files for conflicts, as the extension performs this task automatically, saving them time and increasing workflow efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the Dbmigration Checker extension is a vital tool for preventing conflicts in dbmigration files and improving workflow efficiency. Its ability to perform automatic checks and provide users with valuable information about potential conflicts is essential in ensuring the smooth operation of a codebase."
