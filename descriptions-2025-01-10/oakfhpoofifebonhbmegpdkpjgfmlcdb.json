But sometimes there is a need to provide longer post, clarify challenging question, quote somebody’s words, etc. There are good thoughts still not so meaningful for the blog, but much bigger than 140 characters.\n\nYou post long text, Twishort cuts it to the allowed size limit and automatically posts to Twitter with a link. If you follow that link you will be able to read the whole post. By the way, if your tweet less than 140 characters, Twishort would not add the link to it.\n\nPost longer tweets, share thoughts, discuss challenging issues without any limits. So, whenever you’ve got panic that your message exceeds the allowed size limit, don’t be afraid anymore. Share without limits.\n\nThis tweet longer app that allows you to extend Twitter limit and tweet more than 140 characters (good alternative to twitlonger)."
