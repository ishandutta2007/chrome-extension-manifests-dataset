Developed by Nintendo, the game places players in the role of Dr. Mario, a doctor who battles pesky viruses in a laboratory setting. The goal is simple yet challenging: clear the screen of colorful viruses using vitamin capsules that Dr. Mario tosses into the playing field.\n\nEach vitamin capsule is composed of two segments, which can be of the same or different colors. Players manipulate the capsules as they fall, rotating and positioning them to align matching colors with the viruses. When a horizontal or vertical line of at least four matching colors is formed, the viruses and any overlapping capsule pieces are destroyed. Success depends on the playerâ€™s ability to strategically plan placements and adapt quickly as the capsules descend.\n\nThe game becomes increasingly challenging with each level. Higher levels introduce more viruses in varying arrangements, demanding sharper reflexes and more precise strategies. Dr. Mario rewards players who can think ahead, make the most of limited space, and remain composed under pressure.\n\nAccompanied by its iconic 8-bit soundtrack, including the lively \"Fever\" and \"Chill\" themes, Dr. Mario delivers a uniquely engaging and addictive gameplay experience. Its simple mechanics and escalating difficulty have made it a beloved classic among casual and hardcore gamers alike.\n\nWith its intuitive controls, vibrant visuals, and focus on problem-solving, Dr. Mario has stood the test of time as a puzzle masterpiece. It continues to captivate players, offering both nostalgic charm and an enduring challenge for new generations of gamers."
