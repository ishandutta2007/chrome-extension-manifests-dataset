The idea behind the technique is that the timer instills a sense of urgency. Rather than feeling like you have endless time in the workday to get things done and then ultimately squandering those precious work hours on distractions, you know you only have specific minutes to make as much progress on a task as possible.\n\nYou can also show timer badge from extension options so that you can see the current state of the timer as a badge.\n\nWhen time is up, you will get a notification for that."
