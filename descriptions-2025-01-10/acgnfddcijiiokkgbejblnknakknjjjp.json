The V-DOCS solution digitally presents, signs, seals, stores, verifies and retrieves all documents related to a customer transaction with virtually no change to existing in-store procedures.  V-DOCS improves customer satisfaction and processing speeds, while providing centralized access to agreements digitally archived in our secure storage solution. Moreover, V-DOCS helps companies save money, both on physical resources and the labour required to maintain them, while being environmentally conscious in doing so!\n\nWith the V-DOCS Chrome Extension, you can:\n\n• Submit, sign and process contracts quickly & conveniently from your Web Browser.\n• Ensure that contracts are signed and dated at all applicable signature points.\n• Effortlessly provide your customer with a signed PDF copy of the contract via email.\n• Easily attach any additional supporting materials to the contract, such as a driver’s license, simply by using your mobile device’s camera. \n• Quickly access any incomplete contracts so that they can be signed and submitted.\n\nSave a tree, cut down your costs instead!  How can V-DOCS transform your business?"
