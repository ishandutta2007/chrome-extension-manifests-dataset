You can drag the clock by clicking and holding the mouse on it, and resize it by dragging the lower right corner.\n\n• Click the minimize button in the upper left corner to enable a tiny \"time capsule\" version of the clock.\n\n• Click the \"New Window\" button (+) in the upper right to pop open the current clock into it's own browser window that you place anywhere on your computer.\n\n• Click the \"Full Screen\" button in the upper right corner to fill the current web page, or as a new window for a true full screen experience.\n\n• To customize the clock's appearance and manage blocked domains, click on the settings icon in the bottom left corner of the clock. This will open settings where you can change the font size, background color and opacity, and load random background images. You can also toggle the display of date, time zone, and seconds. Click the Save button to remember your settings.\n\n• If you want to hide the clock for a specific domain, simply open the settings and click the block button. This will add the domain to a blocked list which you can also manage in settings (from any other site that isn't blocked).\n\n• To minimize the clock into a small \"time capsule\", simply press the corner arrow in the upper left of the clock.\n\n• Click the dock icon to select from preset locations on the screen: top left, top center, top right, bottom left, bottom center, bottom right, and screen center.\n\n• Click the New Tab button to open full-page the clock in a new browser tab.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nPrivacy:\n\nThe HoverClock Extension only saves your settings locally on your browser using Chrome's sync storage.
