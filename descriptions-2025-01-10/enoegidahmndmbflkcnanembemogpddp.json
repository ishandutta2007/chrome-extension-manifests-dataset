It isolates the native `console.log`, `console.info`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` methods, saving the log output in **localStorage** for better control and persistence. Developers can enable or disable logging for specific applications by adding them to the `\"js_easylogger\"` entry in localStorage, allowing for targeted monitoring of logs across different apps.\n\nEvery developer should install this extension because it simplifies the debugging process by providing:\n\n1. **Selective Logging**: Activate logs only for specific applications, reducing noise and focusing on the most relevant data.\n2. **Persistence**: Logs are stored in localStorage, ensuring that important information remains available across sessions.\n3. **Enhanced Control**: By isolating logs, it allows developers to maintain clean console outputs, making it easier to debug complex applications without unnecessary clutter.\n\nIn summary, **easy logger** is an essential tool for developers who want more control and clarity over their console logs, leading to a more efficient and organized development workflow.\n\nhttps://github.com/ericluciano/easylogger"
