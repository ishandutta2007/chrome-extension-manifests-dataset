Uses the standard Redmine time tracking features.\n\nThis tool gives you a few handy features to help track time in Redmine.\n\n*A button in your browser to start/stop time tracking*\nIf you're on a Redmine issue page when you start tracking, it tracks time for the issue. If you're inside a project page (but not inside an issue), it tracks time to the project. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (Alt + R) to start/stop timing.\n\n*A page full of your projects*\nSome people don't always work on Redmine issues (like account managers) -- they need an easy way to jump from project to project and track time. Right-click anywhere on any page and choose \"Show Redmine Timer Buttons\" from the context menu.\n\nWhen you open the list, you'll see a touch-friendly list of those projects. I move this window onto my laptop screen (as opposed to my main external monitor) so I can simply touch the one I want to time.\n\n*Bugs*\nInstead of leaving a bad review, which will crush my soul, please add bug reports here: https://bitbucket.org/jprc8/redmine-timer-for-browsers/issues.\n\n*Notes*\nMy company uses this extension and it hasn't set anything on fire yet. That said, there is ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY expressed nor implied. Use at your own risk. Don't call me if it somehow doesn't work, deletes all of Redmine, terrorizes your cat, etc.\n\n*Additional Credits*\nIcons made by Freepik from http://www.flaticon.com.
