Is it a nickname? Is it a way to abbreviate a word? The word kaomoji can be defined as \"the mark of confusion\". However, when Japanese children learn to read kanji characters, kaomoji are actually part of the kanji. A word with kaomoji attached to it is translated into Chinese and Japanese with the same characters. So, technically speaking, a Chinese word translated as \"kaomoji\" is actually the kanji character \"M\".\n\nA new Japanese language trend is making its way to social media, and it'll have you in stitches.\n\nKaomoji, which translates to \"dog face,\" was first spotted in Twitter last week, and it has been popping up on the social media platform since.\n\nIt's essentially a mix between Japanese and American emojis that's been updated with cute dog ears and large puppy dog eyes. The best part? Kaomoji aren't supported in any emoji"
