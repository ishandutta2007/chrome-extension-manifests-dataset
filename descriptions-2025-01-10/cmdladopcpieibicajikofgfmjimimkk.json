First of all, it will add a pitch fader* to the player. Second, it enables some simple keyboard shortcuts to help you discover new music faster.\n\nShortcuts:\nSpace: play/pause\nRight/left arrow: go forward/back 5 seconds\nDown/up arrow: play next/previous track\nPage down/up: play the next/previous vinyl in your list, cart or charts\n+/-: adjust the pitch (for now it's actually the playback rate)\n\nThis extension is only for the JavaScript version of deejay.de. If for some reason you are still getting the Flash version of the player, you can disable Flash for the site to see it in action.\n\n* At the moment it only changes the playback rate. If I find a solution for actual pitch modification I'll update the code.\n\nFeedback is always welcome, so if you think something is missing send me an e-mail at codeexhibit@gmail.com\n\nThe source code for this extension is released under an MIT license (you can use it in any way you want as long as you give credit to the author) and can be seen here:\nhttps://github.com/codeexhibit/deejay.de"
