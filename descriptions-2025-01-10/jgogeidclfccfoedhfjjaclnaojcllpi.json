This extension allows you to securely export your information displayed on third-party websites (for example centralised exchanges or fintechs) with a cryptographic proof of authenticity, or in other words, proof that the data comes from the right source. You can then get access to other platforms or gated opportunities by reusing these proofs.\n\nUse cases: the primary use case for now is frictionless zk-KYC for DeFi. In the future, we see much broader applications for proof of KYC, funds, age, country of residence etc. \n\nInstallation and setup\n\n1. Download the Keyring Connect extension from the Chrome Web Store\n2. Navigate to https://app.keyring.network/, select the Keyring Connect verification option to start\n3. Follow the prompts to log into the relevant websites and the extension will initiate secure data transfer in the background\n4. Once verification is complete, results are automatically sent to the Keyring app\n\nKey features: \n\n- Works with any website. Get in touch if you want Keyring to support a new data source\n- Simple & secure user flow\n- Signing and information extract using MPC-TLS, protecting your sensitive information\n- Easy navigation with side panel extension instead of pop-ups jumping around\n- Via the Keyring App, use your verified information to create Web3 credentials on-chain and access permissioned opportunities\n\nGet started today and access new opportunities in DeFi in just a few clicks."
