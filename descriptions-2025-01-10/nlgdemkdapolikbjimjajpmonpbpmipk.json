The debug mode tells the DTM or Launch library to add application messaging to the console. The staging mode for DTM uses the staging library instead of the production library.  For sites using Adobe Launch, the switch allows easy switching of environments within a property. \n\nOnce installed, an icon will appear in the address bar when a site has Adobe Launch or DTM installed.  Click on the icon to expose the control panel.\n\nNotice of anonymous usage tracking:  This extension tracks anonymous usage data.
