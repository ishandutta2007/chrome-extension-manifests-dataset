All communication is secured using HTTPS/TLS, so in theory the unencrypted (plain text) data is only visible in your Salesforce org and in the extension when it is used.\n\nA network request is made to the SOAP API's getUserInfo resource which may contain the running user's PII as described here: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_getuserinfo.htm\n\nThe only other piece of PII is the target user's username which is queried and displayed on the refresh button."
