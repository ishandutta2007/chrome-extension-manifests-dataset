The setup is simple: once the extension is installed, go to the \"List view\" of a Notion database. Click on the Notion play extension, and it should recognize your template. Click \"Present\" and it'll start presenting! Once you're done, click on the icon again and hit \"End Presentation\".\n\nWhen you click \"Present\", you'll get a list of instructions on how to navigate the presentation. You press Ctrl+F for forward and Ctrl+B for back. For the best experience you might also want to present in full-screen-mode (toggled by Shift+Cmd+F in Chrome) You can also navigate to a specific slide by pressing the Notion play icon and clicking on the slide you want.\n\nIf you have feature requests or bugs, please report it to tklightningfast@gmail.com."
