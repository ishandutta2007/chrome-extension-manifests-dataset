We're adding new portals every day so all your invoices can be collected by our extension, so don't hesitate to ask for the ones you need!\n\nThe extension navigates to your portals and scrapes the invoices. We only store invoices that are sent to GetInvoice, no other data is stored.  \n\nA GetInvoice account is required to use this extension (there's a free plan available).\n\nWhat portal should we add next?"
