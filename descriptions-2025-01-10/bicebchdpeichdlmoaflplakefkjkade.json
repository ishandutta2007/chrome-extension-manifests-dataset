If you have a valid reason, you are given a set amount of time to get your work done on the website. If not, you are encouraged to be more specific in your answer or to reflect further.\n\nFor example, if you're trying to access YouTube to watch an educational video, you can enter the website; however, if you just want to watch cat videos, reflect will prevent you from doing so. You can customize the list of blocked websites and the duration that the websites will be blocked. \n\nWe don't show ads or collect/store data. \n\nWe're also an open-source project! You can find our source code here: https://github.com/getreflect/reflect-chrome."
