Easily Download Or Save Photos From Any Website And Webpage\n\nKey features\n================================\n✔️ Super easy to use: just click the icon!\n✔️ Outputs all images in 1 zip file \n✔️ Supports many formats: jpg, png, gif, svg, webp, base64, etc. \n✔️ Can handle hundreds of images\n✔️ Finds lazy loaded images\n✔️ Follows links to original image\n✔️ Requires only minimal permissions\n✔️ Works in incognito mode\n\nHow it works\n================================\n1. Click the add-on icon to start\n➜ Extension searches the active tab for images\n➜ Extension downloads all discovered images and creates a zip file\n2. Unzip and do whatever!\n\nExtension needs permission to access URLs to be able to download images directly on your device. This gives user privacy knowing their activities are not visible to developer. Review permissions disclaimer below to understand why specific permissions are requested.\n\nMinimum permissions disclaimer\n================================ \n\"activeTab\"\nExtension analyzes active tab to determine what images to download\n\n\"http://*/*\" and \"https://*/*\"\nActual images are hosted over various domains. This permission is needed to enable CORS to fetch image data directly on user's device in javascript. The request is direct from user's device to server hosting the image (no proxies or other servers are being used). This permission is the minimal permission needed to accomplish this core extension functionality.\n\n\"contextMenus\"\nThis extension has no significant UI, therefore non-core extension features are accessible through the context menu\n\n\"storage\"\nfor saving user preferences\n\nPrivacy Policy\n================================\nhttps://oceanofanythingofficial.github.io/All-Image-Downloader/Privacy%20Policy.html"
