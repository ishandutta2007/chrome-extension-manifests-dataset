Sola scriptura dictates that the Bible is inerrant, infalliable, written by human authors, but God-inspired (1 Timothy 3:16). \n\nThis application replaces the Chrome New Tab page, and returns a unique bible verse overlaid a unique picture every time a new tab is opened. Hopefully, this extension can help people have a constant reminder of God's word and God's creation.\n\nApplication created as a side project during Summer 2018 to practice/learn Front-End ReactJS. Only shared to friends of Pathlight/LBCSJ.\nhttps://github.com/jonlikesapples/SolaScriptura\n\nLogo created by Benji Tseng. http://benjitseng.com\n\nI TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS APPLICATION.\nmad shout out to Winggo Tse of UCSC, take a look at his original extension. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glorify/cgfkjilppdjifdiabiogenbncidmpkkd?hl=en"
