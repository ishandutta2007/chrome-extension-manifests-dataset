A little thing to annoy friends and family.\n\nThis was made in about a week. It's simple and does not require any work to install, just download the extension, and it will automatically start rotating your cursor on most websites*.\n\n\n*Some websites may not work, and this cannot work over iframes (ads, sandboxes etc.). As well as this, this does not physically move your cursor - it only displays a rotated cursor.\n\n—————\n\nVer 1.6: Size can now be changed, with a more user-friendly slider."
