In the \"screen is kept on\" mode (sun icon), the system will avoid sleeping and the display will additionally remain on.\n\n* What do the icons mean?\n\nThe sun icon means that the screen will be kept on. The moon icon means that the system will behave the same way that it would if the extension were not installed. The sunset icon is a middle ground: the system will avoid sleeping (as described above) but the screen will still turn off.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n| Release notes for version 1.9.1 (1.9.0 was never published):\n - It was updated to Manifest Version 3.\n - Updated the manifest.json file with more values.\n - Added more icon image sizes.\n\n| Release notes for version 1.8 (1.7 was never published):\n - Removed windows.onCreated hack added to work around http://crbug.com/222473 on Chrome OS."
