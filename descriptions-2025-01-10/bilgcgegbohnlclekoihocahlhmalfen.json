Me too. Rating systems do a great job pairing players with opponents of similar strengths but can also take some fun out of the game. I've found that I'm hesitant to play if I don't feel like I'm in peek condition because I'm worried about my rating. Though ratings can be useful as a measure of progress, seeing my rating fluctuate makes me play less chess, and as a consequence make my progress slower. That's ridiculous!\n\nThis extension creates a ratingless experience on lichess.org. Ratings are still at work in the background pairing you with players of similar strength, but you never have to see them. This is the first version of the extension and there are still some ratings lingering around if you really go looking for them. Please let me know what you'd like to see improved, or if you find a bug. \n\nTo disable the extension simply click the extension icon at the top right of chrome (it's a blue version of the lichess logo). The icon will turn gray indicating that the extension is inactive and ratings are no longer being hidden. Clicking the icon again will turn it blue and the extension will become active again.\n\nIf you find this extension useful please consider buying me a cup of coffee:\n - PayPal: https://paypal.me/UnrealDuck\n - Bitcoin: 1Gy8GQhvDBka6Sx1DwFPo1bh9Bs6gbZEEB\n - Venmo: @ethleb\n\nFeel free to send questions, bug reports, and words of encouragement to duckunreal@gmail.com."
