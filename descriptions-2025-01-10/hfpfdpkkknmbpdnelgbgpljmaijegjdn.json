You can afford deletion of gemini conversations with just a few clicks and within seconds.\n\nHowever there is a known issue which at the moment leads to hovering first on any conversation to make Extension available to handle the deletion, cause of some development limits due to Gemini Source page hiding some needed stuff.\n\nWatch out the extension GitHub Repository. Contribution is really appreciated!\n\nCredits: \nChatGPT Bulk Delete Extension for an overall quick look for how to handle deletion properly and setup extension, also cause idea was taken from it to perform the same thing on Gemini."
