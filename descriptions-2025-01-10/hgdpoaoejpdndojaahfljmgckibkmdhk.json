You're a busy bee.\n\nWith that in mind, don't you hate it when you constantly need to \"Switch Accounts\" while trying to use Google services? Don't you wish that you could automatically login to a default Google account of your choice, and quickly swap accounts only when absolutely needed?\n\nThat's where ChromeSwitcher comes in! ChromeSwitcher automatically redirects you to the right Google account when using Google services such as Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Meets. \n\nGive it a shot! We'd love to hear what you think. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please fill-in our feedback form or get-in-touch!\n\nNote: ChromeSwitcher currently supports a limited number of popular Google services, including Docs, Drive, Mail, and Meet. Please fill-in our feedback form to request additional support / product features!"
