For instance, try H8sMJSCQxfKiFTCfDR3DUMLPwcRbM61LGFJ8N4dK3WjS.\n- Open any dApp which supports the Solana Wallet Standard and you should see Impersolator show up as a wallet option. Click on it and the dApp will believe you're connected with the address you configured. For instance, try it on Jupiter (https://jup.ag/).\n\nObviously, it will not let you sign transactions but it can be useful for testing purposes, to see a cold storage address that you haven't added to your daily wallet, or simply to check out what a whale is up to."
