It will record personal statistics on things such as your typing speed and the pages you visit. StatusFrost will record your activity, much like many web trackers do, but instead of using that information for advertising purposes, it will simply display it to you in a concise, pleasant manner. StatusFrost is currently in the early stages of development, so here's a few things I hope to get done:\n• Add more sites to category tracking list\n• Add more metrics\n\nPermissions explanation:\nStatusFrost tries to use as few permissions as possible. Here are the permissions it uses and an explanation for why it uses them:\n• Access to Tabs - StatusFrost needs access to these in order to gather statistics on events within the webpage\n• Storage - StatusFrost use this to persist data so your statistics don't reset\n\nChangelog:\n  v0.2.1:\n    • Fixed ratelimiting issue\n  v0.2.0:\n    • Several UI improvements\n    • Mouse distance tracking\n    • Minor fixes\n  v0.1.4:\n    • Added new category of sites: News\n    • Improved doughnut chart colors\n  v0.1.2:\n    • Doughnut charts now display percentages\n  v0.1.1:\n    • Important hotfix\n  v0.1.0:\n    • Reduced scope of permissions\n  v0.0.10:\n    • Fixed CPM not updating properly\n  v0.0.9:\n    • Various fixes\n    • Now tracking clicks as a metric\n  v0.0.8:\n    • Several minor fixes and tweaks\n  v0.0.7:\n    • Better domain matching\n  v0.0.6:\n    • Added commerce category\n  v0.0.5:\n    • Fixed CPM not displaying properly\n  v0.0.3:\n    • Fixed bug where data didn't display\n    • More information displayed to users\nStatusFrost is Open Source!\nhttps://github.com/Plazmaz/StatusFrost/\nSupport the Author by donating here:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/plazmaz"
