Is the video game footage you are watching too bass heavy or has a high pitched hiss going on in the background?\n\nNow you can use Browser EQ to filter, boost or cut the audio frequency content of anything you are watching in the browser, whenever you want.\n\nRelease Notes:\nAs of version 1.0.0, there is only one instance of the eq enabled per browser, which means when you toggle the EQ popup on another tab, that tab will take over and the previously EQ'ed tab will go back to its default audio stream.\n\nRight now EQ persists between URL changes and page refreshes, so to close it down completely you need to close the tab (or alternatively toggle the EQ on another page). \n\n\nComing soon,\n\nPresets, specified by use cases to give you an easier starting values.\nPanning controls, to fix possible stereo problems on the video you are watching.\nAbility to turn EQ on/off from the UI without having to close the tab."
