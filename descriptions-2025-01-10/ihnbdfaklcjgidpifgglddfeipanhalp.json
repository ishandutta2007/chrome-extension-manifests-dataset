We spend 40+ hours per week working. If you have trouble with spending too many of your hard-earned dollars, then this extension will help you. It puts every Amazon item into terms of hours worked (based on your hourly pay) and helps you get a realer idea of the true \"cost\" of things. Make sure what you're paying for is worth the time you worked for it. Keep more money in your pocket, meet your savings goals, and only buy things that are worth your time. This time is Hours to Lose."
