You can highlight text in your browser and select different mental models that make you question and reflect on the content. This can be used in situations such as when you are writing a blog post or an email and want to clarify the message, you are reviewing a long-form description and need a second opinion or if you just want to understand and reflect on other users' emails, social media posts or blogs. \n\nBring your own OpenAI key! \n\nWe are updating and refining the types of feedback that you can receive how so feel free to send us feedback at hey@wisecraft.ai"
