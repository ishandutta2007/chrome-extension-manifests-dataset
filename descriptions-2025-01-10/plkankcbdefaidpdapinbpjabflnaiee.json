Say goodbye to searching through email chains and dealing with rogue requests. Instead, users can submit to legal in just a few clicks for an embedded, intuitive experience that works where users do.\n‍\nBuilt-in workflows also allow access to legal-approved playbooks, clauses, and templates, minimising legal intervention while maintaining compliance.\nThis unique approach removes friction and frustration for the business, with huge time and efficiency gains for legal!"
