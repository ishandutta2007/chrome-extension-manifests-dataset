It uses a progressively lighter shade of colour to indicate the nesting level so it's easier to automatically process. You can also toggle collapse a particular reply and it's nested children by clicking on the \">>>\" icon on each post. \n\nOne minor caveat though is that, on 4chan, a reply can be made to more than one post at once. Instead of nesting the reply under both the referenced posts, I only show the reply in one of them, and in the others, it shows them up as \"Not Nested\".\n\nOh and also, the extension does not work with the \"Update\" at the bottom of each thread - since I couldn't be arsed with handling it and it got the job done for my use case."
