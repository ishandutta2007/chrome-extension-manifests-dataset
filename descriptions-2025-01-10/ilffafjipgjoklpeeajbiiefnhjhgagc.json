Our Chrome extension lets QAs, PMs, and designers record clips, add comments and annotations, and automatically store all the technical information from the clip sessions —then share it with the web development team.\n\nThen web developers can replay the recorded clip sessions to inspect what the tester was doing visually, as well as their comments, annotations, and technical information from their browsers—everything they need for debugging on one screen!\nCheck out our backend integrations to include server logs and server error reports to your clips –  https://github.com/synchrolog."
