Browsing through their community plugins repository online to find a suitable package/theme got on my nerves.\n\nTurns out all the original image links were embedded in the html elements already.\n\nApparently the images have been broken for at least 12 months. Figured I might as well share this fix if the folks at Atom don't seem to care.\n\nSource code:\nhttps://github.com/nlydv/atom-io-imgfix"
