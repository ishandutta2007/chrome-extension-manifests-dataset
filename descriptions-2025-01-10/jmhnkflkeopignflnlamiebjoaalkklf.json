With QR IT you can get any text , quote , notes or even if you have to type something but don't want others to see then you make a QR-Code out of it . The user interface has been kept very simple and I hope it helps you guys. The extension itself is super easy to use just select and copy the text and paste it inside the input box or just type away the text and get the QR-Code for it instantly.
