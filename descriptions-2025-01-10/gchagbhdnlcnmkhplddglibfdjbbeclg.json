Knowing an overtake has happened before you see it can spoil the fun. This extension allows you to delay the live timing feed to match with your TV.\n\nClick the \"Display Delayed Timing\" button when you're on the F1 Live Timing page to access the delayed feed and additional visualisations to enhance your F1 experience.  You must be on the leaderboard tab before clicking.\n\nVisit \"Race Control\" to view the live timing data archive.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nExpect some bugs and updates between races as the extension as new features are developed and added.\n\nYou require an F1 live timing subscription for this extension to work. Currently it only works on the English version of the formula 1 website.\n\n------------------------------------------------\nChange Log\n\n2024\n+ Added 2024 compatibility\n\n2023\n+ Updated to remove legacy live timing screens\n\n2022\n+ Added basic F2 and F3 delayed timing\n+ Improved graphing functions\n+ Graphic performance improvements\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is an unofficial enhancement for F1 live timing.  This extension is not related in anyway to Formula One World Championship Limited. This extension does not allow you to bypass the subscription required for live timing"
