( my people in Android land know what I'm talking about ;-D )\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nIf you don't see your favourite website in the list, you can press the \"Request This Site\" button to let us know so we can add it for you :-)\n\nYou can also report a website that is in the list but not working anymore.\nWebsites are updated by their creators fairly often and sometimes those updates might break the way our extension works, so we need your help to know when something changes ;-)"
