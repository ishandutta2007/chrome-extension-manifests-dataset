This can allow you to create gridlines or outlines for common item placement, and assist you with more easily placing your dashboard widgets in a consistent way.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nThis extension is not officially developed by Smartsheet or maintained by them.\n\nUsage Instructions:\nThe extension will add a new icon to the right sidebar of Smartsheet's dashboard editor. Clicking on it will open a panel that allows you to enable or disable different overlays for the dashboard's grid. Clicking the More ( â‹® ) button at the top of the panel will open the extension's settings page, where you can add custom layouts - instructions for this are included on this page.\n\nAlternatively, you can click the extension icon in Chrome to immediately add the grid layout to the dashboard editor. This is included in case future changes to Smartsheet's dashboard editor break the functionality of the side panel."
