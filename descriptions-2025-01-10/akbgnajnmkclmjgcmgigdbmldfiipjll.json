Stay motivated, hydrated, and active while working on your homework, projects or simply entertaining yourself on your system! \n\nYou can type in a specific number of minutes, or seconds, or use the pre-built buttons (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes) to have a notification remind you to drink water and do some push-ups! I made this for myself, but I hope others can find use to better themselves while having to be productive on their laptop. So stop browsing, or working for a minute to do some push-ups or drink water!\n\n\nV2 includes a switch that allows looping an alarm once it's set!\n\n- First click on the switch to turn on the loop capability.\n- Press one of the pre-built buttons, or type in your desired time. Press enter to \n  set or press the set button. \n\nCreated on Windows 10 OS."
