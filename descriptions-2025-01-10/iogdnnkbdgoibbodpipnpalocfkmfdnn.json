It will let you see the current prices of a coin at a click of a button. Furthermore you can view candlestick charts to see latest price movements in supported exchanges. This extension supports almost all major exchanges and some other exchanges. This extension directly integrates with the particular exchange's API without a middle man to ensure most up to date prices are displayed.\n\nYou need to first select the exchange that you are interested in from the drop down menu. Extension will remember your last choice. You can view all the tickers (currency pairs) and prices available for that exchange when you select an exchange. After loading you can click on a ticker to view history of price movements.\n\nPlease note that, sometimes there can be loading issues due to the rate limits enforced by some exchanges. I am sorry for that since I do not have any control over it.\n\nFuture enhancements,\nFeature to convert between different currencies."
