No more searching for the Home key on your keyboard, and no more dragging the scroll bar.\nIt's just going to be fun and ergonomic to use.\nPlease note that this extension doesn't work on every page. It works on most sites but it won't scroll down the browser's internal pages (settings, history, etc.) and some complex web pages (like the Add-ons store itself, for example)."
