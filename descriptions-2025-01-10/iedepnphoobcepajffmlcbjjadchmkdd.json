Lead with a point of view, become a trusted advisor, motivate buyers to act.\n\nTribyl surfaces these insights by using NLP/ML to mine sales conversations (emails, calls, documents, notes)\n\nHere's what Rob Lewis, veteran Qualtrics Sales Leader, has to say:\n\n“To succeed, sellers must have a deep understanding of the Buyer and their circumstances. You can’t just ask, ‘What keeps you up at night?’ and expect to get there. Sellers must use insightful questions to determine how they can add value and help.\n\nLearning from other deals and use cases is a critical part of winning with more efficiency and confidence. The ability to codify and share this tribal knowledge at scale has always remained elusive. Until now.”\n\nYou must be an existing Tribyl customer, and be signed in for the extension to work."
