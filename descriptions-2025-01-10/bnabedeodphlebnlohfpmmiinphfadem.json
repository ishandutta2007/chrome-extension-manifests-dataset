Anyone who has used the Google Toolbar will feel at home with the Queria Toolbar. But because it opens in a balloon popup, it keeps Chrome looking spiffy and doesn't take up any vertical screen space. The toolbar is also designed for speed, so it doesn't slow down Chrome like other toolbars do.\n\nThe entire toolbar is completely customizable. For example, if you prefer Yahoo over Google, you can change the default search engine and the logo to Yahoo. Even further, you can hide the buttons of the search engines that you don't use. By default, Queria Toolbar comes with 7 built-in search engines, but you can create as many custom search engines as you like. If you love Lifehacker, you can add Lifehacker as a custom search engine so you can search for your favorite Lifehacker articles quickly and easily.\n\nNew in version 3.0.3:\n*All known bugs are fixed!\n*Did some housekeeping to preserve forward compatibility"
