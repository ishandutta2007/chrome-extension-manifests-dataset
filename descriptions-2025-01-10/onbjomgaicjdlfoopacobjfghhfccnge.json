It also includes a Guardrail feature, designed to protect sensitive financial or personal data from leaking onto the internet (if enabled), ensuring your prompt management remains secure and private.\n\nMaximize the effectiveness of your prompts by organizing them into distinct components: persona, system prompt, and user prompt. Our extension assists you in structuring prompts this way, improving overall performance and clarity.\n\nSecurity Note: While the Guardrail feature has been rigorously tested with numerous patterns and prompts, it is not guaranteed to be 100% foolproof. We recommend that customers review and verify their prompts before submitting them to an LLM to ensure optimal security and accuracy."
