You can read through each line one at a time, but sometimes it's hard to understand what the engine is trying to tell you. Wouldn't it be great if you could quickly identify moves that exist in multiple lines? That's what Move Highlighter does. The most common moves are highlighted, each in its own color. If the move Nf3 is in all five lines, you'll be able to tell at a glance, because Nf3 will be highlighted in (for example) green, everywhere it shows up, and the human eye can quickly spot all the green highlighting a lot more easily than it can spot all the instances of text like \"Nf3\"."
