See the percentage complete, the number of good, bad and warning links, and how long the report took.\n\nYou can also use the key combination Ctrl (Command) + Shift + K to run the extension.\n\nAs well as checking all the links on a page you can click the green, amber and red sections in the pop up to view the links in a handy list. From there you can even click the link to find where it is on the page (as long as it's not hidden by a parent element).\n\nThere is a context menu when right-clicking a link on the current webpage to run Link Checkr manually for that link. From there you can see the status of that link, hover over the icon to see more in-depth details, and click the icon to remove it.\n\nIn the options you can switch between using HEAD and GET request methods. HEAD is faster, but GET is more reliable. It's entirely up to you which you choose!"
