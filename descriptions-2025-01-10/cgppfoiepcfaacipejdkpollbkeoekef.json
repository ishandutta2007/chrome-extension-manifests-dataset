In my personal experience, when there are too many options on an Amazon results page, the most effective way to make a decision is to ignore products with a low number of reviews. It's tedious to use brain power for this. It's also a good way to avoid new items that have fake reviews.\n\nThis extension automatically filters out products with low number of reviews. You can also add a filter for minimum stars. Hopefully this saves you as much time as it saves me! \n\nLess time, less crap! \nHappy shopping!"
