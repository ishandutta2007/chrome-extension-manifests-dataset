Can be useful when you assign a host another IP using e.g. /etc/hosts\n* Add custom colours to each host\n* Adjust the opacity of the frame\n* Add custom border edge widths to each host\n* Define what z index you want the borders to be at\n* Import and export your frames for use in other browsers or for backup"
