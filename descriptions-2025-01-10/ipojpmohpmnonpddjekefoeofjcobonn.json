It can parse text from an entire webpage, or, if text is selected, it will parse only highlighted text.\n\nThe score is not necessarily indicative of the actual positivity of the text, moreso, it is an interesting measurement based on this dataset. However, it may be an interesting metric to see how the webpages you are visiting are affecting your daily mood. The AFINN-165 dataset is based on traditional usage of words and not necessarily accurate when compared to alternate or modern uses, especially with respect to profanity.\n\nThis is something we did in about 4 hours because it seemed fun. Feel free to send feature requests or bug reports using the Github issues page."
