It identifies relevant keywords that boost SEO performance and uses natural language processing (NLP) to create engaging, relevant and accurate headlines.\n\nSummarization\nTansa’s article summarizer can help organizations quickly and accurately create news briefs. By analyzing the content of an article, Tansa can extract the key points and generate a concise and comprehensive summary.\n\nAccuracy check\nUsing advanced NLP algorithms, Tansa scans headlines and articles, analyzing the content, context and tone. By cross-referencing the headline against the article’s body, it detects discrepancies, inaccuracies or misleading statements.\n\nKeyword identification\nIdentifying relevant keywords is essential for improving the visibility of news articles. Tansa’s \nAI tools employ sophisticated keyword analysis to identify the most appropriate and trending words for a given topic. This aids news creators in optimizing their articles for search engines and ensuring that their content aligns with current trends.\n\nSocial media posts\nCrafting effective social media posts is crucial for promoting content. Tansa’s tools generate \ncompelling and concise posts that are optimized for various platforms. They consider character \nlimits, trending hashtags, and audience engagement strategies.\n\nTranslation\nIt’s a small world... and many publishers need to produce content in multiple languages. Tansa’s \ntranslation service can assist in this process by offering high-quality, automated translations that are accurate and coherent.\n\nEverywhere you need it\nTansa is a flexible solution that works in the most popular text editing applications, web platforms and page layout software. \n\nCustom dictionaries\nYour dictionaries can be adapted to suit your organization perfectly. We can help customize your solution by analyzing a large volume of your company’s published text.\n\nSave time and money\nOur customers have documented dramatic increases in productivity, reducing copy editing time by as much as 40 percent and drastically reducing published errors.\n\nImprove readability\nTansa can identify the number or length of characters, words, sentences and syllables to ensure Plain Language guidelines are achieved. Tansa’s readability score is based on several indexes, including Flesch-Kincaid, Dale-Chall and SMOG.\n\nWrite with variety and precision\nTansa will suggest synonyms where there is more than one option. Synonyms develop your writing by giving you a more varied and richer vocabulary.\n\nMake your own adjustments\nThe Tansa Web Admin is designed to work as both an interactive tool to direct Tansa’s proofing engine and as a searchable style guide. The type of permissions given to users are based on the users’ roles. Administrators will be able to edit and manage entries, while the majority of users will only be given permission to view entries and make suggestions.\n\nA multi-lingual solution\nOur solutions are available in more than a dozen languages. Multiple languages can be supported in a single environment which makes it easier for our customers to distribute the solution to offices around the world. \n\nIntegrated and customized for your tools\nUse Tansa’s APIs or drop our proofing client into almost any editorial system, proprietary or out of the box. This creates a centralized editing solution, whether your users are working in Microsoft Word, Adobe InDesign or your own custom-developed web CMS.\n\nPrivacy is paramount\nYour text is protected while being analyzed, never stored and not used for training generative AI. We prioritize keeping your content secure and confidential.\n\nCustomers worldwide uses Tansa\nMore than 150k writers, editors and page designers around the world use Tansa on a daily basis to improve their editorial workflow."
