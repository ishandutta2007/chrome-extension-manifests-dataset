Initiation ratio: the number of times you initiated a conversation vs the number of times they initiated a conversation. Lower initiation means higher Alpha.\n\n2. Word count ratio: the number of words sent by you vs the number of words sent by the them. Lower word count means higher Alpha.\n\n3. Response time ratio: the number of seconds you take to respond to them on average vs the number of seconds they take to respond to you. Higher response time proportion means higher Alpha.\n\nThese three metrics are weighted and aggregated to determine your Alpha score.\n\nFeedback, queries and requests for additional features should be directed to our developers: https://discord.gg/87a7gyAVCZ"
