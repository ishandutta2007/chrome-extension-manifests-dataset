However, there's something off about how the page is structured. Too much focus on sidebars, big sticky headers and misaligned content.\n\nIf you, like me are annoyed by this, simply install the extension and forget about it. Whenever the page loads, you are presented with a clean, decluttered view of the blog post.\n\nThis extension requires basically zero permissions apart from reading the site titles eng.uber.com"
