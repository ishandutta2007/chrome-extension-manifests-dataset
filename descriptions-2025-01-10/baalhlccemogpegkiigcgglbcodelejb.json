Aims to shame Michigan State Men's Basketball for their partnership with Rocket Mortgage.\n\nNotes:\n- Does not (and will not be changed to work) on the term \"MSU\", out of respect for fans of Mississippi State, Missouri State, Montana State, and others. \n- Does not work on some link tags (to prevent it from actually changing link URLs, for instance, and break pages). It's not perfect but it's good enough to be fun.\n\nIf you have suggestions on terms that should be added, please create an issue on the Github page listed for the support URL."
