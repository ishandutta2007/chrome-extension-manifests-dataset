Also fixed a bug where aspect ratio was still distorting for uploaded image files. \n- As of 4.2 the bug responsible for distorting the aspect ratio of images when resizing has been fixed.\n- As of 4.0 resizing is less intrusive and basically works like Reddit Enhancement Suite's resizing. Also the resizing works on video and file upload previews when it previously did not.\n- As of 3.1 the resizing bar has become a resizing handle is much much less jank.\n- As of 3.0 now adds janky resizing bar to image previews."
