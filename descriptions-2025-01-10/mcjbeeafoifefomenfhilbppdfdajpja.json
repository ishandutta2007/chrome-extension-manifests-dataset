With these protocols, you can initiate calls with ease and enjoy an enhanced experience.\n\nOne of the key benefits of using MeloSIP Click2Call is the ability to dynamically change your caller ID based on the area you are calling. This feature is only available when using the MeloTel API, and you must subscribe to the numbers you want to display as your caller ID. With this feature, you can ensure that your business always presents a professional image, no matter where you are calling from.\n\nIn conclusion, MeloSIP Click2Call is an all-in-one app that provides you with an efficient and seamless calling experience. With the ability to initiate calls on three different protocols, and the option to dynamically change your caller ID, you can enjoy a versatile and enhanced calling experience with MeloSIP Click2Call. So, don't wait any longer, try it today and start experiencing the benefits!\n\nWhat is Dynamic Caller ID Insertion?\n\nDynamic Caller ID Insertion is a feature within the MeloSIP Click2Call Chrome browser extension that allows the user to dynamically display a specific caller ID when making a call through the MeloSIP platform. The feature enables the user to add multiple caller IDs for different area codes, allowing for a customized and localized caller ID display when making calls to different regions.\n\nTo utilize Dynamic Caller ID Insertion, the user must first add their desired caller IDs through the MeloSIP platform. Each caller ID can be comprised of three main variables:\n\n1) Area Code\n2) Caller ID Name\n3) Caller ID Number (10 numbers).\n\nThe user can add as many caller IDs as they need to ensure they have a localized caller ID for each region they plan on making calls to.\n\nOnce the caller IDs have been added, MeloSIP will dynamically insert the appropriate caller ID based on the area code of the recipient of the call. For example, if the user is calling a recipient with a 416 area code, the caller ID will display the user's phone number with a 416 area code. If the user is calling a recipient with a 514 area code, the caller ID will display the user's phone number with a 514 area code.\n\nDynamic Caller ID Insertion solves the problem of having a generic caller ID display for all calls made through MeloSIP, allowing for a more personalized and localized approach to telemarketing calls. The feature helps to improve the likelihood of recipients answering calls from unfamiliar numbers and can lead to increased call success rates."
