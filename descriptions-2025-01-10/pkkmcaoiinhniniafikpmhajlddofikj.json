This extension was made to make it clear to know which Merge Requests you've gone through without having to click into each and every one.\n\nChangelog:\nJan. 14th, 2020 (v1.3.4):\n* Added support for Group Views with subgroup projects\n  * Authors and approvals will now properly be fetched for group views. Previously, subgroup projects were not propogating correctly and resulted in undefined project IDs.\n\nJan. 21st, 2019 (v1.3.3):\n* Fix for very large group views\n  * There was an issue with the selector on merge request `li` items in the group view which caused massive mix ups of where to inject approvals and move author views around.\n\nJan. 20th, 2019 (v1.3.2):\n* Added Group support\n  * The plugin now works for all composite group views.\n  * Uses a single API call to get project ids (only if it hasn't seen one before!), and then similar functionality as a project view.\n* Added option to clear all cache and settings\n\nJan. 19th, 2019 (v1.3.1):\n* Fixes a caching bug which involved getting the wrong time stamp off the page\n* Fixes the generalized permissions issue\n  * Allows me to publish faster\n  * Potentially reduces the number of whitelisted websites that will work with the extension. Going to keep investigating."
