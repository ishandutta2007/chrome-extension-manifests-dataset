BUILD API - This mode lets you use the latest APIs that can be used to control the Bolt Device manually. Select the Operation you want to perform with your Bolt Device and you'll be able to control your Bolt Module in only a few clicks.\n2. VIEW DEVICE - This mode lets you view the Bolt Device (Public) directly from this section. You can view a graph of your Bolt Module's readings. Or it could be designed buttons made for controlling particular functions. All of which can be coded on the Cloud Dashboard's Product Section.\n\nThe abilities are limitless with this Extension. Since this is only a Beta Version of the extension, we will update with more features very soon.\n\nWhat is Bolt IoT?\nBolt IoT is an integrated IoT platform that offers you with a WiFi Chip to connect your actuators and sensors to the Internet. You can configure such a system over the Bolt Cloud to receive, store and visualize the data over graphs. You can also connect actuators such as motors, light bulb and control them over the Internet. We also offer APIs to fetch data and control the devices from any platform. Bolt provides bindings for platforms such as iOS, Android as well as programming languages like Python, PHP, etc. You can even run ML algorithms with just a few clicks.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n- Start building and managing your IoT products at http://cloud.boltiot.com\n- Access to our forum: http://forum.boltiot.com\n- Look for more such APIs in detail: https://docs.boltiot.com/docs/api-request-syntax"
