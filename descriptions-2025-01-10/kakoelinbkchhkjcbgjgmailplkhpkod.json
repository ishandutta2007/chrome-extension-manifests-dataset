However, with our extension, users can easily create a personalized link by pressing the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-shift-p. By selecting the desired webpage and pressing the shortcut, the page title will be copied to the clipboard, and the URL will be pasted into the chat window.\n\nThis way, friends can easily understand what interesting content you're sharing, without having to read the URL manually. Our extension also allows users to create unique links for different occasions, such as for work, play, or personal use.\n\nWith our extension, users can easily and effectively share webpage links with their friends, and create personalized links that showcase their unique style and preferences.\n\nIf you encounter any issues while using the extension, please submit an issue on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Deguang/link-and-title-copy-pro/issues"
