This shows up as \"Browser History\" when Chrome installs this extension. This extension will never save any information from your browser or your history. \n\nThis is a very simple extension that allows for viewing files inside the web browser, that you normally wouldn't be able to view. \n\nSometimes you come upon a website hosting to a Microsoft Word file (.docx) that you want to read. But it takes time for the file to download, and for Word to open and browse the file. Using this extension you can view the file right inside Google Chrome WITHOUT downloading the file to your computer. The extension uses Google Docs to view the files. Easy and secure.\n\nYou can still download files if you want to. (see screenshot)\n\nThe current version of this extension can view the following file-types: \n.docx, .doc, .pptx, .ppt, .xlsx, .xlsx, .ai, .eps"
