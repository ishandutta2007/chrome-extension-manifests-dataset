Displaying an average rating of the professor underneath their name as well as a visual star rating\n2. Creating a hyperlink on the reviews visual the extension creates, that links to the professor's PlanetTerp review page, where users can read the reviews of the professor\n3. Similarly, the extension adds a hyperlink to the course name which links to the associated PlanetTerp course page, where users can see the distribution of GPA grades visually. \n4. Including an average GPA of the course right under the course name\n\n\nThis extension works on any UMD course catalog (Schedule Of Classes) page that have visible course names and sections. On page load, this extension gathers all the course names and adds in the GPA of the course underneath the name. Professor ratings are only injected once a section becomes visible (i.e when the user clicks on 'Show Section' for a specific course). Once that happens, a hyperlink text of the rating will be added that the user can click on to directly jump to the PlanetTerp review page for that professor, as well as a simple star visual rating underneath. I would like to note that PlanetTerp's API, contains all course data and professor reviews. This is why we extract our information from there. \n\n\nThe motivation behind this is to allow students of UMD to make informed decisions when signing up for classes. With the use of PlanetTerp's API, this makes signing up for courses, much easier!"
