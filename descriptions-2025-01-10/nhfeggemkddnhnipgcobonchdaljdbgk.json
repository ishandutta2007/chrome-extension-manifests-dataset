While most people use to-do apps or project management tools to stay organized, there are times when minor tasks slip through the cracks or when you have so many browser tabs open that switching to a separate app to manage tasks becomes cumbersome.\n\nFor those who primarily work in browsers and need a simple way to stay on top of their tasks, browser extensions are the ideal solution. However, I found that many existing extensions are either too complex or lack the minimalist design I was looking for. That’s why I created this extension.\n\nOriginally developed for my own use, I’m sharing it with you because I believe it can enhance your productivity too. Give it a try, and keep an eye out for more extensions coming your way soon.\n\nEnjoy the extension!"
