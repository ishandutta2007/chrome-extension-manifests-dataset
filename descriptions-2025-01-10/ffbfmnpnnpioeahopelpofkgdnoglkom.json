Ever had to constantly switch between multiple YouTube video tabs when pausing a tutorial to play some music while taking notes? Ever open a new video tabs to watch later, only to lose track and have a cacophony of audio? This Extension helps you focus on the video YOU want to watch with two core functions:\n1. When you play a YouTube video, all other YouTube videos on different tabs and windows are paused.\n2. When you pause a video, the most-recently played video plays automatically in the background, allowing you to have a constant stream of sound"
