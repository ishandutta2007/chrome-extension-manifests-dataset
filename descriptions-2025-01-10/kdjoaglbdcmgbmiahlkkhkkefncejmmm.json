It checks the API every 10 minutes for any changes to posts in your watch list. It will prompt you for an access token on first install to give it a higher quota for querying the API.\n\nIf you would like any additional watch options, please make a feature request in an issue at the Github repo: https://github.com/shu8/stack-exchange-post-watcher/issues. I'll try my best to add it in!\n\nThis extension is also available for Firefox! Install it from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/stack-exchange-post-watcher/!"
