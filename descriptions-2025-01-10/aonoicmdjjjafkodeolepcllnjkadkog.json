Sounds like you need some Helple! Once you install the Helple extension, a button will appear on the right side of the Wordle game board. If you click the button, you will be presented with a list of five letter words that are statistically the best options available to you. If you use Helple on every turn, your chances of winning are near 100%. I recommend using it only as a last resort (once or twice per day) to keep the game fun. Enjoy!"
