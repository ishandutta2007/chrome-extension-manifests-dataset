You can turn on or turn off each of these improvements individually using the extension's menu.\n\nThis extension does not gather or store any of your personal data. It does not interact with any website other than dreamingspanish.com and youtube.com. With the exception of adding YouTube videos to your outside content, all of the enhancements it provides happen in your local browser only and don't affect your Dreaming Spanish account.\n\nSome technical details--\n\nThere is a limit to what can be shown about your video watching history because of what Dreaming Spanish records and doesn't record about the videos you watch. In particular, if you watch a video more than once, the extension only has information about the most recent time. Also, if you skip forward or backward while watching a video, the extension's best estimate of the amount of time you watched can be incorrect. There's not much the extension can do to fix this; the necessary data simply isn't recorded anywhere.\n\nWhen in doubt, trust the watch time from Dreaming Spanish. It's totals are correct, even if the details in the Insights chart are sometimes off a little.\n\nFor the \"Send to Dreaming Spanish\" button to work on the YouTube History page, you must also have a Dreaming Spanish tab open somewhere. Currently this feature only works if your YouTube History page is in English.\n\nI hope you enjoy the extra insights, but remember that the important thing is to watch a ton of content and enjoy the process!\n\nUpdates--\n\n1.3.5, September 14, 2024:\n- Update to track latest changes to Dreaming Spanish.
