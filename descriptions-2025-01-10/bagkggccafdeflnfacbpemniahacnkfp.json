There probably exists better filter than this one, and the filter will be improved in the future. Please feel free to send suggestions.\n\nBugs:\n * Entering or leaving street view does not automatically toggle the contrast, yet.\n * Labels become a bit blocky.\n * The extension asks for permission to *all pages* because I didn't have time to enumerate all top-level domains for Google Maps such as www.google.de/maps and www.google.co.jp/maps (there are lots)."
