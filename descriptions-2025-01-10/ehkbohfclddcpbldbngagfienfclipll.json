That's it. No personal information, no ads, no micropayments, no subscriptions.\n\nWhy blur your page, you ask? \nIt's easy to lose track of how good a design is when you're focused on the content. It's easy to lose track of simplicity as you add incremental details to a marketing page or web application.\n\nWhen I was taking college art classes, my painting professor encouraged us to walk away from our work regularly and squint at it from across the room as a way to quickly evaluate the overall composition. The same principle works here. You can tell if your project has strong visual hierarchy and good use of foundational design principles by looking at it with the distracting details obfuscated."
