It makes it fast and easy to listen to releases as you're browsing. Click the Shovel button next to a release on Discogs to add it to your listening queue.\n\nShovel works on every key page on Discogs - Artists, Labels, Sellers, Search, Lists and more.\n\nNo more opening tabs to listen to a release.\n\nYour queue persists as you browse different pages or even leave Discogs. So you can create a playlist and then let Shovel autoplay. Or you can quickly skip through tracks.\n\nYouTube videos load first time! And broken links are automatically skipped.\n\nConnect your YouTube account and add to playlists directly from Shovel.\n\nHappy digging!"
