However, the standard Mixamo user interface is rather minimal, and over time some built in features have been removed. Mixamo Batcher extends the standard Mixamo UI by inserting some additional features while viewing the site.\n\nAmong the features, some included are:\n\n- Project management\n- Project wide preferences e.g. download all files as fbx for Unity\n- Animation packs that will load the correct character model\n- Quickly scaffold out character animation packs by duplicating packs\n- Tweaking parameters in Mixamo automatically syncs to pack animations\n- Download the entire pack as a single archive file\n- Per animation download preferences \n\nThis activity will be saved into your browser's local storage, with the ability to export and import project data as JSON."
