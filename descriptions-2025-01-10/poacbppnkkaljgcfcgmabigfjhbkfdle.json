Often, repositories display auto-generated alphanumeric IDs like K43234 for contributors, making notifications difficult to read. With WebEdit Pro, users can map and replace usernames (e.g., K43234 -> \"John\") across notifications, improving clarity, especially when dealing with hundreds of contributors.\n\nHow Does WebEdit Pro Help? \n\nFor instance:\nBefore: K43234 committed a new change\nAfter: John committed a new change\nWith WebEdit Pro, such text replacements become effortless, even for thousands of entries.\n\nAs mentioned above it is an open source following is repo\nGithub link - https://github.com/cyberfury10/web-edit-pro"
