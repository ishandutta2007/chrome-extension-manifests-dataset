They exist but buried under so many Pro elements.\n\nThis extension solves that problem by hiding Pro elements from your view. \n\nThe result? Faster design process. No more second-guessing or wasting time looking at Pro elements you don't want to pay for. \n\nAfter installing, it automatically replaces all Pro elements on Canva with a very subtle \"Pro Hidden\" text. Whatever you see in the sidebar then are only Free ones!\n\nIf you want to see the Pro elements, just click on the extension icon & toggle it off. Super easy.\n\nRight now, the extension hides Graphics, Pictures, and Templates. In the future, we plan to add support for Videos and Audio elements as well!\n\nStart saving time and energy designing on Canva today by installing this extension.\n\n---\nNote: \nThis extension hides 50 Pro Elements daily upon installation. You can increase the limit to 500 hides/day for absolutely free. To get unlimited hides, you can pay a low one-time fee to support the development and maintenance of the extension."
