Instead of manually searching a name over a dozen times, use this extension to do the same once on any tab.\n\nNote: If there are any social media platforms/websites you'd like me to include, leave a rating with your suggestion and I will update the extension!\n\n\nNotice: This extension works within the capabilities and legalities of Google Chrome. Thus, searching is not smooth on sites such as Instagram due to their lack of a search page."
