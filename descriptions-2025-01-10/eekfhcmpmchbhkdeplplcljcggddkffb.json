(But also works with H-O-A if you check the box to enable H-O-A)\n\nv1.3 Version Toogle with double-click: \n\nThis Version works now with doubleclick on the big video-player and makes it fullscreen (maximized) , doubleclick again to make it back to normal size. \n\nthere is no browser-action-button anymore, as it only watches google-hangout urls and adds only this doubleclick behavior. \n\nanother fix is the size, the screenratio is now respected and black border added if its to high or to wide. \n\nno keyboard-shorcuts and no browser-buttons (next to addressbar) as its not needed, doubleclick is more intuitive and works always in normal and f11 -mode. \n\nv1.4 Migrate to Manifest v3"
