It also includes ability to build and show direct link to specific Acquia subscription\n\nWhat is this for?\nIf you have many Acquia subscriptions for your sites, sometimes you need a quick way to find where a site lives. Traditionally, you would login to insight.acquia.com and navigate through each subscriptions domain list searching each page for a match. Or, if you are technical savvy you could even write a script against their Cloud API to dump and catalog these mappings. \n\nFeatures\n* Show Acquia subscriptions data per a site\n* Simple for usage\n* Easy for configuration\n\nConfiguration\nGo to configuration page of the extension by clicking right button mouse on the extensionsâ€™ icon. On the page we need to configure X-Acquia-Monitoring Header field. \nThe value will be a key, which you can find on any one of your server's Apache configuration files. To find the key, run this command on your Acquia server:  \n_$ grep X-Acquia-Monitoring /etc/apache2/conf.d/*._"
