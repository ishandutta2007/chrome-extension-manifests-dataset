A new tab is created that displays a minimal UI including the date, time and week of the year. Like Marcus Aurelius, we will be constantly reminded to take care of our most precious resource: time. As Marcus Aurelius famously said \"Memento Mori\" or \"Remember that you will die\". It is easy to forget time; maybe even forget that we are mortal. Rather than interpreting this phrase as morbid or depressing, we must think of it pragmatically. It reminds us to set our priorities, to cherish the time that we have right now, and to figure out what truly matters to us.\n\nThis extension displays randomized quotes from famous Stoic philosophers and practitioners. The interface has a Light and Dark mode, as well as a customizable Header, allowing users to choose between the app logo, a custom greeting or show nothing at all for complete minimalism.\n\nStoic is free and will always be free for as long as it doesn't require large servers to accommodate its features. New features will be added frequently and is subject to user feedback.\n\nStoic does not access any of the user's information or relay it to any remote serve. The storage access in Stoic is strictly for containing user settings and can only be accessed through the local Chrome browser client.\n\nOPTIONS MENU:\n\n* Please pin the Stoic icon to your Extensions bar. This is currently the only way to get to the options menu.\n\nTo do this, simply click the Extensions icon in Chrome, then click the Pin icon next to the Stoic extension (an illustrated tutorial can be found in this Extension's screenshots).\n\n** I'll be recreating the entire Chrome Extension in React.js somewhere in Q1 of 2021. My goal is to make the extension more dynamic and easier to use.\n\nUpdates:\nVer. 2.1.1:\n- Updated total weeks for 2021 and beyond.\nVer. 2.1.0:\n- Hosted the quotes API on heroku. If you'd like to contribute to the quotes, please send a pull request and I'll gladly add the quote(s)! I'll have to filter it out to make sure that we don't have any copies though!\n- Added more quotes\nVer. 2.0.6:\n- Apparently, 2020 has 53 weeks, NOT 52.\nVer. 2.0.5:\n- More quotes\n- Updated CSS styling\n- Optimized CSS\nVer. 2.0.4:\n- More quotes\nVer. 2.0.3:\n- More quotes\n- Started using modules to keep the JavaScript clean\nVer. 2.0.2:\n- More quotes\nVer. 2.0.1:\n- More quotes"
