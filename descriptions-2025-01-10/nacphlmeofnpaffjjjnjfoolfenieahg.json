The extension is primarily focused on Amazon at this starting point. We concentrate on Amazon because, personally, we have been unaware of where our purchases are being delivered from, and in several instances, we have suffered the consequences.  \n\nYou can “drill” down in Amazon and eventually discover the third-party vendor, but who wants to do that every time you surf or intend to purchase something? Our add-in will save us and you that time. Seriously this was started as a “private extension,” but we have had numerous friends and relatives ask us to make it available to them and others. \n\nThe whole theme of the extension is to be alerted where the item we are about to buy is being delivered from. Simply to avoid circumstances such lengthy returns or ability even to return, shipping fees, waiting to receive replacement parts, and after that wait not getting the correct replacement part, or simply not getting a refund and/or the entire refund.\n\nWe scoured the web looking for extensions that would alert us when purchasing from overseas vendors. For starters, we selected Amazon as our first shopping site. While there were a few vendors that were forthright and told us their location, there were others that showed an address, but when we looked into this further, they were overseas, meaning then our return would have to be as well. Some other vendors we have found use a third party name vendor-wise with a US address however, if one needs to return something etc. you discover by luck, you need to return said item overseas. So we made it our mission to develop something that would alert us when something was being purchased that would be coming from overseas.\n\nOur extension will alert you based on the countries you select. We do not block anything - we specifically query vendor location. So simply, our extension queries vendor country information and will alert you with the information you need.\n\nFor detailed directions, see: https://merchant-trap.com/chrome\n\nBasic instructions are:\n1.\tInstall the extension\n2.\tRegister on the website (merchant-trap.com) or via the extension.\n3.\tVerify registration by responding the email.\n4.\tLogin using the extension\n5.\tSelect countries that you would like to be alerted.\n6.\tShop on Amazon.\n\nNote: We do not use your registration information for anything but authentication using our API. Internally, we like to see what countries and states are using our extension and contemplating multilingualism. We will not sell or share your information.\n\nNote: We are working on further development for other sites but are waiting to see if there is any interest in the future.\n\nNote: We do not block any purchase and strictly will alert based upon your country selections."
