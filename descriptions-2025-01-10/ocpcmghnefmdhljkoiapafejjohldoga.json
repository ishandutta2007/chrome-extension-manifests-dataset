Different search engines can be added according to the user's wish to the right-click menu.\nThe search results are shown in a new tab which can either be a focussed tab or a background tab depending on the options set by the user. The location of the newly opened tab can also be set by the user to be either next to the current tab or the last tab.\nThe order of the search engines in the right-click menu can also be arranged. A list of 40 commonly used search engines has been added so that users can choose easily. If needed, the user can also add an option which has not been included.\n\nYou need at least Chrome version 88 to install and use this extension.\n\nIf you like the extension, please don't forget to rate it 5-star (preferably!).
