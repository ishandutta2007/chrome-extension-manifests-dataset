The Clip All button simply simulates clicking on all of the displayed coupons on the screen so that you don't need to clip each one individually.\n\nDisclaimers:\n\nThis button attempts to click  ALL of the coupons on the displayed page; it does not contain any option to exclude or limit coupons, nor does it check to see if a given coupon has already been clipped before clicking on it. The Dollar General Coupons website does not appear to have an option to un-clip a coupon and there is no way for this Extension to simulate that functionality. The Developer of this Chrome Extension is not responsible for any issues that arise from the use of this button ( including problems with clipped coupons or any deals/discounts/sales which those coupons pertain to ). \n\nThe Developer of this Chrome Extension is not in anyway affiliated with or endorsed by Dollar General Corporation or any of it's vendors/partners. This Chrome Extension is distributed AS IS under open source licensing without any warranty express or implied, except as required by law."
