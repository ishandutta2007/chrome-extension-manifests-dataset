When you are on a leaderboard page that contains this column, you can click \"\\\" (backslash), and this will remove all of those rows with non-zero external buffs and renumber the leftovers. This allows players to compare base class performance values without the extra fluff data points. \n\nThe data can persist from page to page, so if the numbering you are interested in is multiple pages in on a specific leaderboard, you can start on page 1 of the leaderboard, use backslash, go to the next page, use backslash, and continue until you get to the page of interest. This will allow the user to continue the numbering scheme of non-external buffed rankings. If you go backward, the numbering will reset, allowing you to see the ordering on that specific page alone.\n\nAs the feature to filter out these results does not currently exist on this site, this helps a user have more flexibility in what they are looking for on a given page."
