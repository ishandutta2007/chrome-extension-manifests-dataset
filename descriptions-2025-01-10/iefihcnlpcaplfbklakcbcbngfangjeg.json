This add-on uses SQLite library which is compiled from C language to JavaScript with Emscripten compiler. Emscripten is a source-to-source compiler that can compile native C/C++ codes to JavaScript language.\n\nTo work with this add-on, just open the app UI and drag an SQLite file to the designated area in the app (top section). Once the SQLite is fully loaded, you will see the commands in the text area (middle section) within the UI. Simply add/edit the code and then click on the - Execute SQLite - button at the top left corner (the green button). Please note that executing any command may take some time depending on the SQLite database size. The result is rendered in the result section (section III) within the app UI. You can also save the database by pressing the - Save Database - button at the top. Moreover, there is also a button to insert a \"sample\" SQLite code. Simply press this button and then click on the - Execute SQLite - button to see the results.\n\nNote 1: since this add-on runs SQLite commands within the browser, it runs slower than the native SQLite application/library. However, using it is very easy compared to the native SQLite application. Please note that, for a very large SQLite database, you still need the native application. This add-on is only suitable for a reasonable database size.\n\nNote 2: this add-on is still in beta and may work as expected. Please report your bugs or any feature request via addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/sql-reader.html), bug report form."
