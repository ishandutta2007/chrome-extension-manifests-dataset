If you're familiar with Chrome DevTools, you know you can inspect any text of a page and edit its content. With Edition Mode you can do this in an easier and more comfortable way.\n\nTo activate the extension and make all the page's texts editable, you have to click on its icon or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + E. The extension's icon can be found among the rest of those you have installed, at the top right corner of Chrome's window. It can be deactivated doing the same thing to make all the texts that weren't editable initially unmodifiable again.\n\nAre you still reading? Well, there is one REALLY important detail you have bear in mind for the extension to work. Many of web pages' texts are contained in buttons or links that execute actions when they're clicked. Once the extension is active, to change any text without triggering these events, you may need to make use of this little trick: instead of pressing the text with the left click of your mouse, as it would be done normally, you need to use the right click and then press the Esc key. This way, you can access the text and edit it without activating its associated actions.\n\nYou can watch a demo here: https://youtu.be/iplQsZN6-uE.\n\nCode: https://github.com/jmt-chromeextensions/EditionMode"
