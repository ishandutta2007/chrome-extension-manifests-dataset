I developed this extension that allows users to hide this content, specifically 'suggested for you' pages, reels, and short videos. So people can actually focus on content shared by people or pages they actually choose to follow.\n\nSupported languages at the moment: EN, ES, IT, FR, DE, PT\n\nDo you like this project?
