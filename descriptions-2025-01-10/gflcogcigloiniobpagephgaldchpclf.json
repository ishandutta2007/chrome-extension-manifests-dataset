If you struggle to remember to check your emails regularly, if you want to schedule a task for yourself that you don't have time for right now, this is for you. I designed this as someone who has ADHD, and have struggled with remembering to do tasks that I put aside even when I had time. This is a very simple extension that will allow you to create alarms that open tabs to any website you want at whatever time you want."
