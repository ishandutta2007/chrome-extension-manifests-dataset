Whether you're scheduling your day or just gearing up for the weather, this extension is your go-to guide.\n\nThis extension provides weather forecasts for both today and tomorrow. The switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit is automatic and depends on the target country. Even if you're using a VPN or proxy, you can manually adjust the city if it is incorrectly determined during installation. This adjustment can be made from the top right corner of the New Tab page. Also, if you prefer, you can opt to switch from a dynamic background (which changes depending on the time of day) to a static one - this option is also available on the top right corner. \n\nThis lightweight extension does not gather geolocation data or IP addresses. If your city is inaccurately determined, you can manually change it on the New Tab page. \n\nSupport multiple languages, automatically chosen based on your system's language.\n\nBy clicking “Add to Chrome,” you agree to install the WeatherFlow Chrome extension, setting your Chrome New Tab to the one provided by the service, and you accept the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The search functionality on the New Tab will be powered by Microsoft Bing.\n\nv1.0.1\nNew settings menu where you can set dynamic/static background, change set of the images for the background, change your local city.\n\nPrivacy Policy - https://hh-ads.com/privacy.html\nTerms of Service - https://hh-ads.com/terms.html"
