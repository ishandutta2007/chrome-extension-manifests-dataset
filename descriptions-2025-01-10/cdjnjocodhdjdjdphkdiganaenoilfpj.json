I can't guarantee the email addresses will stay the same forever, as the list of domains are controlled by Mailinator.com and may be updated in future versions.\n\n---\n\nVersion 3 just fixes the email link, which had been disabled by Mailinator sometime in the last 3 years. There's still an issue with the domains not all being valid, but I haven't figured out a good solution to that yet."
