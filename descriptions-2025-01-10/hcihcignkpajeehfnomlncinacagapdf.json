You can also open the tabs \"snoozed\" to reduce memory footprint prior to reading the tabs.\n\nFinally, you can set up keyboard shortcuts to open selected links with a keystroke.\n\nWhat's new in 1.8.0:\n1. New options:\n  a. deduplicate: open the first instance of duplicated links\n  b. focus: give/don't give newly created tabs/windows focus (this can look confusing if used for new windows since they can show up on top)\n2. Persistent plugin options: these apply to context menu  clicks where appropriate, and set the defaults for the popup.\n3. Cleaner plugin internals using Typescript"
