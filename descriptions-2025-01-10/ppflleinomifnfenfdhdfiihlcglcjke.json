Does the boss man send out a set of hours you have to work for the month? Do you hate that Deltek doesn't show you current monthly totals for a given charge number so that you can actually track your hours effectively? If you said yes to all of those things, then you may find this useful. Don't let the boss man keep you down. Get Deltrek today!!\n\nTo use, simply log into deltek and open a timesheet. Once one timesheet has been opened you'll have access to set allowed hours and +/- percentages in the app by clicking the chrome extension icon.\n\nTo load all hours for a month you'll need to manually open each timesheet. You cannot use the arrows within deltek to navigate between timesheets yet."
