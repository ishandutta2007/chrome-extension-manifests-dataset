For every important Meeting, create a Meeting Page on Confluence and make it accessible to all interested parties. Include all essential information on that page and link the page in the the event description. \n\nWe recommend to create a meeting page with the agenda at least 2 or 3 days in advance to the meeting to gather input and refine the meeting participant list. Only include who can make active contributions. Make the meeting goals and agenda clear. \n\nDuring the meeting, do live collaborative note taking and if possible make the notes visible to everybody on a separate screen. \n\nAfter the meeting, share the results with all participants and also with all interested parties to help your company embrace an open work culture. \n\nKeep spectators out of the meeting and make nobody feel excluded by sharing the agenda and meeting results beyond the participant list. \n\nGet Meetical from the Atlassian Marketplace! \n\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/1222405\n\n---\n\n***\n- Firefox user?

It enhances both Confluence and your Calendar, and makes Meeting Notes collaborative, easy and effective. The full name of the App is \"Meetical Meetings for Confluence\".\n\nDo I need Confluence to use Meetical?\nYes you need Atlassian Confluence. You can get started for free: https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence\n\nDo you offer a free solution?\nWe do no longer offer the Free Basic Version as of October 1st 2023. But the App remains free for instances with under 10 licensed users and you can start a free 30-day trial which can be extended if needed. https://marketplace.atlassian.com/1222405\n\nHow is it different from other Meeting Management Software?\nOther vendors like Fellow or Hypercontext ship an entire new software stack which comes with a proprietary editor, limited integrations compared to Atlassian tools, mostly rudimentary templates, disconnected permission management, and yet another expensive software priced per user. Meetical delivers a Meeting Management tool based on your existing Atlassian toolchain, with seamless Google/Microsoft integration at a highly competitive price. With a better editor, automations for meeting series, a huge app ecosystem for many more use cases, best-in-class data security and permission management based on Atlassian/Microsoft/Google, more seamless integration, templates, powerful macros and advanced reports. \n\nDoes Meetical help with transcriptions and support Google Docs?\nWhile other tools like Supernormal or Transkriptor focus on providing transcriptions, automated summaries and AI buzz, we focus on helping teams to take less, but better notes. And we help teams make results traceable and actionable.\n\nHow does it compare to Hypercontext?\nWhile Hypercontext is mostly focused on Leaders managing their 1-on-1 Meetings, Meetical supports the entire spectrum of tactical meetings, including Scrum Meetings, while still being great for 1-on-1s. \n\nDo I need Atlassian Jira to use Confluence and Meetical?\nYou don't need Jira, only Confluence is required, but you can certainly link any Jira issues on the pages etc. Our Chrome Extension also recognised Jira issues in Confluence Tasks and renders Links to those issues. \n\nIs my data secure?\nYes, your meeting data at rest is protected by Atlassian's world class, enterprise ready cloud security infrastructure. We only act as data processor and are committed to keep your data secure on our side with industry standards and security best practices.
