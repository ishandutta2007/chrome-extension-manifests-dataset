It's a great way to spice up that boring new tab screen.  You can also set it to an animation of the entire moon cycle if you want instead, and starting in version 3.0.0 there's also a dropdown menu that you can use as a quick link or bookmark navigation. \n\nFeel free to reach out with any update suggestions, new features you'd like to see, or bugs you experience."
