It shows the latest natural disasters like earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tropical cyclones, and floods as color coded icons with tool tips on a Google Maps backdrop; the icon colors indicate the alert level - green, orange, and red. The icon will look more transparent the older the event was published. There is also a list view which can be used to sort the natural disaster events according to the date/time, region, and disaster type. Clicking on the icon will bring up more details about the disaster event."
