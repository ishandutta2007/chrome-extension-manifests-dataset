Not sure if they are firing properly? Tired of going through the network tab and find the right calls?\nEchoLogyx Test Metrics Debugger allows you to check the goals and metrics â€“ if they are firing at the right time, and with the right interaction. Simply, add the extension, enable it, visit the page where the test is live and see whether the metrics are firing or not. \nYou can see the detailed information about the metrics that are being fired and what information is being passed to the testing tool within this extension. This will save you time and effort to check whether the metrics setup is working for your tests.\nCurrently, this extension works with:\n1.\tConvert\n2.\tVWO\n3.\tOptimizely\n4.\tAdobe Target (mbox V1 and mbox V2)\n5.\tDynamic Yield\n6.\tAB Tasty\n7.\tGoogle Optimize / Analytics\nWe are working to cover more A/B testing tools to easily check metrics and goals."
