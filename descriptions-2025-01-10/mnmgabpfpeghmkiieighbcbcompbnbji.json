Although there is no information on Google Maps, you will have its GPS coordinates :)\n\nIf nothing is selected in Google Maps, the coordinates shown will be those in the center of the screen.\n\nQR CODES:\n\nNext to each coordinates there is an icon to create a QR code and scan it, for example, with your smartphone or tablet to send that information easily to that device.\n\nYou can also create QR codes to scan them with your device and directly open Google Maps or MAPS.ME app with your specific point or place. Isn't it interesting?\n\nSEND TO GOOGLE MAPS:\n\nWith this extension installed on your browser, after selecting a text (usually an address or place) on any website, right click on the menu to select the option \"Search this in Google Maps\" to search that directly in Google Maps. \nIn just 1 click, you will do all this: Select and copy the text, open a new tab with Google Maps, paste the text into the search box and press the enter key. Very cool, right?\n\nCOMBINABLE WITH OTHER BROWSER EXTENSIONS\n★ Pushbullet: Once you have this extension installed, select the desired coordinates in the text field, and from the context menu (right mouse button) press Pushbullet and send it to the device you need. Useful if you use a map service that is not compatible with our QR codes (but you can send me a message and I'll try to implement it).\n\nPLUS CODES:\n\nWhen a specific address is not available or just for convenience, it's possible to use a plus code to find or share a place on Google Maps, such as a company or home address.\n\nMGRS:\n\nThe Military Grid Reference System is a grid-based system used to represent locations using the Mercator Transverse Universal Projection (UTM) and Universal Polar Stereographic Projection (UPS) grid systems, expressed as an alphanumeric character string. It's used as geocode for the entire Earth.\n\nHELP US TO IMPROVE:\n\nWe want to improve this Google Chrome Extension with your help, so don't hesitate to send us suggestions, doubts and bugs or errors. For example, if you think of other map services or websites to send Google Maps coordinates to, send us a message and we will try to implement it.\n\nThank you very much for your support and hopefully this tool will be very useful to you for managing your places and its GPS coordinates!\n\nWebsite URL:https://carrompoolapk.com/",
