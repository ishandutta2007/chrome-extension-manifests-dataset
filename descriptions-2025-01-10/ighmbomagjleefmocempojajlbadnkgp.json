However, since it is in beta it is missing some key features.\n\nOne of these features is being able to see how much each of your moments are worth, as well as the total value of your collection right from your \"moments\" page.\n\nTopshot Trackers aim is to do just that, now when you head over to your moments page, you'll see the lowest ask of all of your moments right under their serial number, as well as see the total value of your collection at the top."
