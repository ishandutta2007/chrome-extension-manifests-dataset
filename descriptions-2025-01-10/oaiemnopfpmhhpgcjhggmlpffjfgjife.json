Its primary function is to provide users with a detailed report of potential vulnerabilities and risks associated with a particular contract. This extension will examine contract structure to identify any suspicious or malicious activities that could lead to financial losses or security breaches. Safetension will help users make informed decisions when interacting with DEX platforms by providing them with an objective analysis of the underlying smart contracts. Additionally, Safetension will continuously monitor the contracts and alert users of any significant changes or anomalies detected in the contract."
