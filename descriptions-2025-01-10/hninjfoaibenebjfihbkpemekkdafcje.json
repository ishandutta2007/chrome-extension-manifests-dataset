Some of these were facebook IDs, which I wanted to open on facebook's graph API, and some were internal IDs I wanted to look up on our own internal APIs.\n\nWith this extension you can write your own resolvers in CoffeeScript, for example to grab an id from a webpage, look it up on your own api and finally opening a page in the browser. Or you could create search shortcuts for your favorite search engines. The context menu gets updated with your resolvers instantly.\n\nOr you can do anything else as long as it's possible in CoffeeScript ;)"
