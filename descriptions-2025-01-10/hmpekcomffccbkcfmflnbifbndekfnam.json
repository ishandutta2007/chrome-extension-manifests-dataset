So I built this extension to quickly jot down my idea, then later copy to whatever noting systems.\n\n\n‚â° What it does really well üí™\n- Fast & Clean\n- Markdown support\n- Writing should feel pleasant (sth like Notion editor)\n- Your data stays in your computer\n\n\n‚â° What it *will* do well in the future ‚öôÔ∏è\n- Pasting image into the editor\n- Searching\n- Exporting notes\n- Data backup\n\n\n‚â° Feedbacks üíô\nIf you have any feedbacks or suggestions, I'm really happy to hear that, feel free to leave me a review"
