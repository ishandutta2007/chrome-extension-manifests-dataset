With Zero Cheating, educators can prevent AI-assisted cheating before it happens—providing students a fair environment to showcase their true capabilities.\n\nUnlike other tools that check the final submission for AI content, Zero Cheating tracks how assignments are created, ensuring authenticity from start to finish.\n\nQuick Setup: Get up and running in just 20 minutes.\n\nFree Lifetime Access: Unlimited use for individual educators.\n\nFERPA Compliant: Zero Cheating does not access, store, or transfer any student data.\n\nNo IT Required: Zero Cheating is installed directly by the teacher as a simple Chrome extension. No need for IT involvement.\n\nNo Student Software Needed: Students don't need to install anything. Everything works seamlessly from the teacher’s Chrome profile.\n\nLightweight and Non-Intrusive: The extension operates quietly in the background, allowing educators to monitor the writing process without disrupting normal classroom activities.\n\nFuture-Proof: While this version is always free for individual teachers, we plan to offer a paid campus-wide license with LMS integration in the future, providing enhanced functionality for larger institutions.\n\n24/7 Support: Our team is here to help with any questions you have. Teachers can book a live demo and get hands-on guidance.\n\nWant to see how it works? Visit the Zero Cheating Website to book a live demo.\n\nStart using Zero Cheating today and promote fairness and transparency in every assignment."
