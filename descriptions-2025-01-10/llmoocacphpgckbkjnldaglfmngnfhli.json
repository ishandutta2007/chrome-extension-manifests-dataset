Just enter an emoji code, such as \":tada:\" and it'll automatically transform into an emoji (üéâ in this case) right before your eyes!\n\nEmojify has plenty of bells and whistles, too. With autocomplete at the ready, Emojify intelligently suggests emojis to you in realtime as you're typing out codes. With a tap of the down arrow, the emoji will insert itself, so you don't have to.\n\nFAQ:\n1. Q: I just installed it but it's not working on my already-open Messenger tab\n     A: Refresh the page and everything should be functional!\n2. Q: I have some feedback/bug reports. Where should I send these?\n     A: Go ahead and shoot an email to dinowaredevelopment [at] gmail.com!\n3. Q: Some of the emojis don't show up in the autocomplete panel. Why?\n     A: This is a limitation of your operating system. Recently, a new set of emojis was released and approved that some older operating systems might not recognize."
