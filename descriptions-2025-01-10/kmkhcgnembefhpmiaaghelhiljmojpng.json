They used to block as many sites as you wanted for free, and had other paid content, but now you have to pay to block more than 6 sites. So I built Eyeshade in about 4 hours to replicate the only functionality of BlockSite I used to use (having an on/off switch to block a list of websites). I was bothered that BlockSite put their most basic functionality behind a paywall after I'd been using it for years.\n\nFeatures:\nBlock List - Block as many sites as you please\nWhite List - Whitelist as many sites as you please\nRedirect URL and templates - When you access a restricted web page you can ask Eyeshade to redirect you to a site of your choosing or use one of our default pages\nTimer - block or white list sites for X amount of time, restrictions will turn off when timer is up\n\nThe offensive tips are for me when I'm in a self deprecating mood, the encouraging tips are for when the ADHD flares up.\n\nFutures features: Custom themed tips page you create for redirects\n\nPlease let me know if there are any bugs or issues or feature requests, I'm likely to fix any issues quickly, and will add features as time allows.\n\nThis extension will always be 100% free and open source :)\n\nIf you have a github account you can directly report things here: https://github.com/DaltheCow/Eyeshade/issues"
