Only remove these if you know that you won't be using those buttons.\n\nAside from removing the action bar and comment pop-up section, you can also remove people from your screen as well. This is great if there is a slightly disturbing or unappealing image in one of the squares. These names should be comma separated. It should be said that this extension cannot actually remove people from the call, it only removes people from your screen.\n\nOnly install this if you have some common sense, and know how to use a computer."
