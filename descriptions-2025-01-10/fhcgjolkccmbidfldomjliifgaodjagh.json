This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Enable \"Active Mode\" in the popup or settings\n3.

You will have to either 'Restore Default Settings' or 'Remove All' in the settings. Wildcards will be supported in a later version (2.X.X)+. \n\n- If a new profile still doesn't work or if you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out.",
