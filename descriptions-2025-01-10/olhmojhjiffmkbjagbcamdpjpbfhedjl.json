Identify and start talking to interesting people\n2.) Stay in touch or reconnect with existing contacts\n3.) Organize and engage efficiently with my network\n\nLinkedIn has lots of great contacts, but when it comes to the day-to-day work, it gets frustrating:\n- I see interesting people on the feed, but I cannot qualify and mark them for later use\n- Finding people is tough especially when it comes to a more detailed search\n- I cannot organize my contacts in e.g. shortlists\n- It's hard to delegate tasks such as processing selected profiles\n\nThere are some tools out there, focused on lead generation or scraping, but I did not find anything which really helped me in my workflow.\n\nSo I created Q!B-crm which integrates a lean CRM adding interaction fields to LinkedIn.\nOn LinkedIn wherever a profile shows up, I can tag them with keywords e.g. \"Fintech Investor\" \"AI conference\", and assign stars e.g. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ to very interesting people.\nThen I select profiles by keywords, sort them by stars, and create lists of people. \nNow my assistant takes over and engages with them.\n\nKeeping in touch with existing and creating quality contacts was never so pleasant."
