We care about your health, therefore, we introduce an extension for adding a dark theme to your Intercom interface. \n\nDARK MODE\nYou can easily switch between light and dark modes and even adjust the contrast and brightness. The theme works across all functions of Intercom, allowing you to concentrate on what matters - your customers.\n\nNIGHT SHIFT FEATURE\nThe screen of your computer or laptop emits blue light and when exposed for a long time can increase the risk of insomnia. But worse than that, extended exposure to blue light hurts your eyesight. \n\nTurn on Night Shift to switch cold tones to warm and reduce the probability of health problems caused by electronic devices."
