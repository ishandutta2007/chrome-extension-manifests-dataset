Identify your roles, determine your priorities, and schedule your priorities. Also, you can include your Personal Vision and Role & Goals so that they at the forefront of your mind when pre-week planning.\n\nThis extension consists of an extend/condense button at the top of your google/outlook calendar (opened in a chrome browser) that allows you to identify your key roles and determine weekly action items by role. You can then click on these items, click on your calendar and turn them into an event/task/etc. This is how you schedule your priorities to accomplish 30-50% more on a weekly basis."
