This feature gives you the ability to disable this default behavior, so that pressing the spacebar doesn't do anything anymore! \n\n➤➤➤➤ PAID FEATURE 1: Enable Gamer shortcuts\n\n➤ The \"W\" and \"S\" keys let you move up and down through your watchlist. Similar to what the built-in shortcuts UpArrow and DownArrow let you do, but you can use your left hand to do so, freeing up your right hand!\n\n➤ The \"A\" and \"D\" keys let you move left and right through all your favorite time intervals in the favorites bar that sits in the top left of your screen. This is a big deal, because it lets you quickly switch between all your important time frames without having to use your mouse! This makes charting so much easier, faster and more efficient because you can just leave your left hand on the WASD keys (like when playing a game) and switch time frames, while at the same time using your right hand to draw on or move the chart. \n\n➤➤➤➤ PAID FEATURE 2: Use the left and right arrow keys to cycle left and right through your favorite time intervals. \n\n➤ Just like with the \"A\" and \"D\" key of feature 1, you can enable the leftArrow and rightArrow keys of your keyboard to let you cycle backward and forward through your favorite time intervals toolbar. Super handy if you want chart with one hand on your laptop!\n\n★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★\n\n➤ Is there a free version?\nYes. The feature to disable the default behavior of the spacebar is forever free!\n\n➤ How much does it cost for the paid features?\nIt's a one-time payment for a lifetime license. No recurring subscription BS.\n\n➤  How do I pay?\nDownload the extension, click the little browser icon in the top right corner to open the popup and click on the  \"Buy Extension\" button.\n\n➤  Can I request new features and shortcuts?\nYes! Just click on \"Request a Feature\" on our website.\n\n➤ Who are you?\nJust an solo software developer who's passionate about the markets."
