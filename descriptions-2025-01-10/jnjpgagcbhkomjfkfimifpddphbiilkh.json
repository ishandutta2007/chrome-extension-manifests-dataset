The website does not.  Reddit Slideshow implements it.  \n\nNote: You will need a Reddit account and be signed into Reddit for this to work.  For some reason Reddit when not signed in is completely different than Reddit when you're signed in and the not signed in mode totally breaks slideshows.  An update is forthcoming to deal with it. \n\nYour privacy is respected. There is no tracking or any other hidden behaviors in this extension. The source code is readable for anyone who wants to read it to verify these statements.  \n\nThis extension DOES allow Reddit to track its usage along with the other tracking Reddit does on its website. None of this information is transmitted outside of Reddit including to the author of this extension."
