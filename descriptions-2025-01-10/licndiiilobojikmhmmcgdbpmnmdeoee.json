It provides an easy way to copy the Insights Hub authentication cookies to the clipboard without having to go to chrome developer tools.\n\nThe extension works also really well with the Insights Hub and Industrial IoT CLI in the Session Cookie - XSRF-Token Configuration.\n\nUse the extension to copy the cookies to the clipboard, paste them to the command line (there is bash, Windows CMD and Windows Powershell support) and start using the MindSphere CLI right away.\n\nYou can also use the extension to simplify the start of Insights Hub Development Proxy in a similar fashion. Just copy/paste the cookies to the command line and start the development proxy.\n\nImportant: Treat the authentication cookies like your credentials and use them only in secure environments."
