By synthesizing several information in the APDEX global performance indicator, it shows the actual level of user satisfaction.\n \nBENEFITS:\nPolish your IT reputation, provide better user experience to your company employees\n \nWhether it’s web or internal, IA-Performance considers all your applications. By type of use, you can define your measuring points and the associated level of commitment to be achieved. IA-Performance collects and aggregates data and makes them available to you. Analyzing all the data in detail related to all the reference periods is at your discretion. You are thus able to detect any ad hoc frustrations or progressive degradations of user satisfaction levels.\n \n \nPrinciple:\nThis Chrome extension enables enterprise deployment and monitoring of the enterprise SaaS applications, with no need to modify the application in any way.\n \nInteract provides visibility into end-to-end transaction time and availability, and browser page performance, errors, and availability, for your web applications. \n \nEnd-user data allows you to detect and react when users are experiencing slow response times and outages.\n \nInteract doesn’t monitor all web apps (SaaS applications), you must define which website should be analyzed, and which metrics to process. To complete this configuration, you need to access the administration Website of Interact (see Interact Documentation to complete this setting) \n \nInto your own Portal, you can access to your own dashboard about your Web Business Application used by your company.\n \nData Analysis on each supervised Web App:\n1.\tRequest\nWhen Web Apps are monitored, each user request is considered.  \n1.\tResponse time \nWhen Web Apps are monitored, each user request is analyzed to identify how long it takes and how long the user is waiting for the response. Response Time is an “end-to-end” transaction time that includes problematic parts (such as Ajax requests) of a web page.   \n1.\tErrors\nThe extension can collect errors into each monitored website, like HTTP errors (404, 503 …) and chrome internal errors. All these errors could be analyzed to evaluate their impact on the User Experience and to define an action plan to solve or reduce these issues.\n1.\tThreshold\nWhen “response time” is over a threshold, an incident is created to understand why this value is over 3 s or over 12 s.\n1.\tAPDEX\nWhen “response time” is over a threshold, the request is classified as Tolerated or Frustrated. With this classification, it’s possible to provide a performance score for each monitored web app: APDEX (https://www.apdex.org/)\n \n \nFEATURES to Interact + IA4Chrome: \n1. Monitor & Analyze & Improve Real User Experience (Session Replay, Behavior Analysis, Issue Root-cause  ).\n \n2. Detect issue before the real user (via a synthetic script, predictive analytics, ml/ai)\n \n3. Be Alerted when an issue or performance degradation occurs \n \n4. Automate resolution of business and technology issues and define specific actions plan to complete it.\n \n5. Analyze performance trends\n \n6. Automate issues root-cause analysis\nContact us: www.interact-software.com"
