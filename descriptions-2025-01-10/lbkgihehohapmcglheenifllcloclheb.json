Constantly checking the front page for new posts only to find out that nothing has changed? Now you don't have to!\n\nWith Reddit at a Glance you can browse reddit anywhere with just the click of a button. In addition, you will also be notified when new posts arrive to the extension, even when you aren't currently browsing it. Once a new post comes in, a notification badge will be displayed on the popup icon. When the popup icon is clicked, the new post will be highlighted and displayed at the top of the popup. This allows you to always be up to date on your reddit browsing.\n\nCheckout the source code here: https://github.com/stefaluc/reddit-at-a-glance"
