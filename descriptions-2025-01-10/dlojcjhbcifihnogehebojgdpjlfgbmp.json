But user research is siloed, expensive and struggles to make an impact!  \nWe are trying to make companies more user-centric by making qualitative data more accessible, sharable and actionable. UserFocus enables companies to create a single source of truth. Designers, product managers or anyone who talks to their users can take extensive meeting notes, code their calls, and analyze their notes to find patterns and insights. \nWe are tightly integrated with Zoom for a seamless user experience. \nWe are now launching our Chrome app to make your note taking experience even better. With our Chrome app, users can save time and focus more on their user calls."
