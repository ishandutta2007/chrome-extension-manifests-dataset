Your account will be able to gain more exposure and reach your target audience more precisely and thus helping you gain more followers and/or make more sales. \n\nHow does it work?\n- ExposureAI mimics human actions by interacting with Instagram users' posts automatically. \n- You will be able to choose an account with a similar target audience as yours and interact with their followers. \n- You will be able to set the number of accounts you would like to go through a day, the requirements of filtering those accounts, and the time intervals between actions. \n- Your profile page would then receive more exposure, and obtain more opportunities for receiving real genuine followers interested in your content.\n\nWhat are the benefits of ExposureAI?\n1, We are very privacy centric. We do not require information such as your Instagram username or password in order to function. As long as you are signed into your account, we can begin working. \n2, Your account will be safe. Since we do not work from an IP address different from your own, Instagram is unlikely to label you as a bot, especially if your usage is kept under a reasonable amount. \n3, We make you the owner of your growth. How aggressively you decide to use our tool to grow your account is up to you. Whether you choose to grow your account more rapidly in a more risky way or slowly build up a follower base safely is up to your needs. Either way, you are not dependent on some arbitrary algorithm within Instagram to be shown to other users.  \n\nIf you have more questions or wish to provide feedback, please direct to exposure.plus8@gmail.com\n\nVersion Updates:\n2.1.6 - Made updates to support changes on Instagram.\n2.1.5 - Fixed a bug in the membership update process.\n2.1.4 - Improved platform stability and made changes to the free plan.\n2.1.3 - Added persona type to improve comment tone.\n2.1.2 - Rebranded to ExposureAI.\n2.1.1 - Fixed a bug in autopilot mode that prevented task from starting automatically on a new day.\n2.1.0 - Rebranded to IGAI, added autopilot and auto comment feature.\n2.0.2 - Fixed a bug that caused daily traffic limit unable to reset.\n2.0.1 - Fix a bug in log display.\n2.0.0 - New UI and added several new features.\n1.2.1 - Extended free trial time period.\n1.2.0 - Added features to allow saving lead accounts.\n1.1.1 - Added icon on extension management page. \n1.1.0 - Added version indication and the export log features to improve customer support. \n1.0.2 - Fixed a bug that caused target accounts to be stuck in a loop."
