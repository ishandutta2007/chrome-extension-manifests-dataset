Server-level redirects are altogether different animals than browser-based redirects, but the end result is the same -- the browser does not fetch the original resource, it fetches the resource that the redirect is pointing at.\n\nThis extension provides the same type of functionality as a server-redirect, but much more convenient for developers, since the redirect can be quickly configured temporarily directly in the browser."
