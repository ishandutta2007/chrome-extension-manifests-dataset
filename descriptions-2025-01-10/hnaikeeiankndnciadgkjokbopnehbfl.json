My specific use case, was that I needed to click a lot of links in production, but have them point to my local environment. The example in the extension is that we replace this regex\n\n/^(https?:\\/\\/(www\\.)?[^/]+)/g\n\nwith this\n\nlocalhost:3000\n\nwhich changes any matching (most valid urls (probably)) to my local environment. Like \"https://mywebsite.com/users/1\" will turn into \"localhost:3000/users/1\"\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPS. This is open source and the repo can be found on https://github.com/Voldemorten/clipboard-text-replacer"
