The matches within the web page get highlighted. \n\nThe extension monitors the page for changes, e.g. during infinite scrolling, and highlights the selected text in the gradually loaded contents.\n\nThe extension does not need any configuration - to activate the extension click its icon. To respect you privacy the extension is deactivated after any navigation. Click the icon again to activate the extension.  \n\nThe extension is free and open source"
