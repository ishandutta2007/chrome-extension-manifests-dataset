It produces an additional layer on top of the data using HTML tags as identifier. \n\nThe software interacts with the DOM Tree of the application, of course technically this holds production data, but we work with HTML Tags from the DOM Tree, which do not reflect any content!\n\nThe Help System is composed of two major components. The backend (hosting the data and providing the client-specific inject scripts) and the inject solution. Together these two components form an unbeatable duo providing your users the personal help system.\nBrowser extensions are needed when we cannot inject the necessary lines of code directly into the page (code) or the application does not offer the possibility to load the script (like product extensions do).\n\nThe Browser extensions does a couple of things, but the major one is: Wait until an enabled URL is hit with the browser, setup the correct backend URL and start the inject scripts. After that, the plugin updates configs changes (the configuration has an expiration date), manages user rights and helps find errors of the Help System on your target application (Debug Mode).\n\nThis version of the browser extension is intended for SaaS use. It is configured to supports the configuration server hostname \"https://config.gravity.global\". Corporations IT who doesn’t want to connect to the public configuration server in the cloud, but instead like to use their internal configuration server, might use the on-premises versions of the extension. Please contact us to setup the proper configuration.\n\nMore information about the extension’s functionality: https://gravity.global/help/ -> Documentation."
