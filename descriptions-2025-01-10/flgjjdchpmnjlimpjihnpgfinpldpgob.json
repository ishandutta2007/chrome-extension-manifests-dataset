No need to pay for any service.\n\nJust select the text you need help understanding, right click, and select 'llama explain' from the context menu.\n\nIt's built on top of Ollama (https://ollama.ai/) and as such, currently runs only on MacOS.\n\nFor full installation steps (on top of this extension, you also need to install Ollama and create models), please refer to https://github.com/welniak/llama-explain. \n\nThe extension is open source, you can find the code at https://github.com/welniak/llama-explain."
