Automatically keep track of your notes and problem data in Google Sheets and have easy retrieval in the extension at any time!\n\nLeetTracker is meant to be a simple, hassle-free way to keep track of LeetCode problems you have done. When you view any LeetCode problem, the extension will display the problem data (title, difficulty, tags, solve status) within the pop up along with a user-submitted form to keep track of time and space complexity and general notes. Once a user submits this form, a Google Sheets spreadsheet will be created and formatted as a table if it isn't already created. Then, the data will be uploaded either as a new row entry if this problem has not been submitted before, or as an update to the row containing this problem. When you visit this problem again, the extension will pull this data into the pop-up and remind you of what you wrote!\n\n\nFeatures:\n- Light Mode/Dark Mode\n- Reset Spreadsheet\n- Addition/Deletion of custom tags (along with LeetCode generated tags)\n- \"Star\" problems for later review\n- Track latest attempt/solve date for each problem\n- Smart detection of LeetCode tab problem data \n- Auto-generated and formatted creation of Google Sheets\n- Auto update of spreadsheet with user-submitted data\n- Retrieval within pop up of past problem notes/data from Sheets\n- More soon to come!\n\nPlease reach out to us if you have any comments, suggestions or feedback!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeetTracker is completely free! We do not track or store data in any database and use Chrome storage for QOL. All API calls are to Google APIs and nothing else. \nWe ask specifically for permission to 1.  upload, edit, and delete files that the extension itself creates within your Google Drive 2. read LeetCode tab data to help populate the form 3. use browser storage to store what you've been writing and display it later. \n\n*We are completely unaffiliated with LeetCode. This is simply a tool designed for increased productivity with the site."
