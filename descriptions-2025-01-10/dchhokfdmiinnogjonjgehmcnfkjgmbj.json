Github actually has done a great job on displaying text files, from source code to the markdown file, but it doesn't display the image in the browser, instead it gives the user the \"View raw file\" link. That's not what I want. I want to view the image right in that window. So I made this extension.\n\nIn this extension, when you are in a page that corresponds to an image file, the little octocat on the address box will be light up, and by clicking it, you can view the image on the fly.\n\nSome notice:\n1. I don't know how to make an icon, so I just borrow the github logo. If anything was wrong, I'll change it, I promise.\n2. Only supports \".png\" file for now."
