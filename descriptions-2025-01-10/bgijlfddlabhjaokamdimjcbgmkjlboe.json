This extension serves as an easy way to block any keywords or websites that you want to avoid.\n\nOnce installed, clicking on the extension icon will bring up a popup with a textbox for entering new keywords to block and a list of your current blocked keywords. To add a keyword, type the word in the textbox and then press enter or the add button. Any sites that contain the keyword will be closed, and any new sites you try to open that contain it will close immediately.\n\nThere is no way to remove a keyword once it has been added, this is by design. This extension allows you to easily add new keywords to block while preventing you from removing the ones already added. It's recommended to use Registry Editor to prevent this extension from being removed."
