Then, this is the right Chrome Extension for you!\n\nFeatures:\n- Eliminates useless PDF sidebars on select major publisher websites!\n\n- Eliminates pop-up PDF windows on major journal article repositories that JStor and deliver Science Direct-ly to you!\n\n- Doesn't really do anything else!\n\nEnable/disable the extension on each publisher site by clicking the extension icon or by going to chrome://extensions > Piss Off > Options\n\nKindly send a support message if you find a publisher whose annoying frames and popups slip through the cracks.  Sometimes publishers revamp (i.e. break) their sites as well, so let me know if things change suddenly!  Otherwise, enjoy!\n\n\nNOTE ON PERMISSIONS:\n\nRequested permissions are solely to identify journal publisher websites and extract the appropriate PDF location. There are no ads, no tracking, and no analytics of any kind. I'm too simple for that kind of thing.\n\n\nCHANGE LOG:\n\nv0.38: New support for (destroying) Elsevier Reader! Several deprecated services have been removed, as publishers seem more amenable to just giving us the damn PDF. If this update breaks anything, please kindly leave a support message!\n\nv0.37: Wiley Readcube has been re-killed!\n\nv0.36: Some long overdue fixes, and deprecated support for some publishers who have finally given up on frames! Hurrah!\n\nv0.35: Proquest support should be fixed.  Added experimental support for the hub of science that shall not be named.\n\nv0.34: Fixed JStor support due to site changes. Added satisfactory Springer support (I hope!). Fixed RSC support due to site changes.\n\nv0.33: New quick url hack to impale the Readcube interface on Wiley and send you straight to the pdf.  (Seriously, why do the publishers think anyone wants this??)\n\nv0.32: Reverting a JStor bug fix.\n\nv0.31: Squashed bugs that broke JStor compatibility. Added requested EBSCO support.\n\nv0.30: Added new options panel accessible in chrome://extensions\n\nv0.28: Added query string support for PDF + Supplementary Info implementation on some sites (e.g. PNAS).  Prior to this version, the extension was recklessly discarding the query string.\n\nv0.26: Bug fix for a situation in which Wiley URLs containing a proxy suffix would not be recognized correctly by the extension, leaving behind a hideous and monstrous header bar.\n\nv0.25: Fix for another useless site change at sciencedirect that broke everything. (8/26/13)\n\nv0.24: The hits just keep on coming.  Here's a fix for RSC.\n\nv0.23: Squashed a bug generated by a change at sciencedirect.com that permitted some pesky PDF popups if browsing from journal TOC pages.\n\nv0.22: Added support for (destruction of!) Proquest.\n\nv0.21: Quick sloppy fix for IEEEeeeeee!\n\nv0.2: Supports (destroys!) more journal publisher websites.  Eat it.\n\nv0.1: First beta release."
