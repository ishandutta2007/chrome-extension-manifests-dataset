The link's text and href attributes are changed to the destination URL after receiving the response (for now, configuration is coming!).\n\nNo tracking!\n------------\nUsing an external service to retrieve the destination URL has the added bonus of  not being tracked anymore because you don't visit the shortified URL. You go straight to the URL where you are supposed to go."
