Enrolling in courses is a breeze with Vandy Scheduler.\n\nDon't worry about choosing a specific section only to realize that it conflicts with another course in your cart. Just click \"Add to Schedule\" on courses you want to take, then in your cart, click \"Make Schedule\" and choose from a list of all possible course schedules you can have! You can also block off times that you wish to not have class and choose classes in your cart that you don't want to be included in a schedule by clicking the \"Preferences\" button.\n\nFollow on github: https://github.com/quinton22/VandyScheduler"
