That means beyond just your home page - some channels you don't want to see in search or recommendations either.\n\nThis extension protects you from these channels, erasing their videos quickly from your feed after they enter the page - that way you're not exposed to them for long. \n\nOn youtube, left click the extension icon to choose a channel - hover over channel names and click one to ban. right click the extension icon, and you can manage the banned channel if you ever wish to do so."
