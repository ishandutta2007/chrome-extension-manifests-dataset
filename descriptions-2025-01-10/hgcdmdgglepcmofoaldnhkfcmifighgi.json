If you search with a query Shop now, the ads in the search results will have buttons with any labels and many ads will have no buttons. \n\nWith this this browser extension, you can filter the ads in search results of Facebook Ad Library by button name, for example Shop now, Order now or Learn more. \n\nWhen you click the extension icon, the ads lacking buttons with the specified text get either eliminated or highlighted so that you can appreciate the accuracy of the button detection. \n\nThe extension has two options:\n- multiple labels of the buttons\n- what to do with the ads without the button - hide or highlight\n\nThe extension has simple user interface:\n- icon\n- options to specify button names and an action hide or highlight\n\nThe extension is free, open-source and thus safe. Do not hesitate to provide your feedback.\n\nNote, the Facebook Ad Library is slow. It takes time to load results. Instead of manually scrolling the page and waiting for new ads to appear, you can automate loading of new search by installing the extension Keep Scrolling https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/keep-scrolling-down-to-lo/ccdhnhacgfmgamilgcdaeifailldgnkl"
