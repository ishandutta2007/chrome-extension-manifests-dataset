Each step can be a simple action or a more complex one, like a timer or a conditional statement.\n\n\nYou can also reference all the steps from an action and use them in another action, this way you can reuse the same steps in multiple actions by overriding the variables used in the steps.\n\nThe ability to organize test scenarios makes it the ultimate tool for saving time and efforts."
