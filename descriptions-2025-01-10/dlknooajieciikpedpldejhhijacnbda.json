Revolver - Tabs\n\nRevolver - Tabs takes your current open tabs and rotates between each of them pausing for as many seconds as you like and continuing until you stop it. Revolver - Tabs can reload the tabs on each view or not if you choose. Optionally Revolver - Tabs can wait while you are active in your browser and only rotate when you are inactive.\n\n** We'd like to thank Wayne Goyer for sharing some significant  and highly requested updates. The power of open source software! ** \n\nThis was created for using Google Chrome full-screen to power unattended screens like kiosks or tv displays where rotating dynamic/live web content is needed.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you have any questions...\nBen Hedrington\n\nTwitter - @benhedrington\nMore Contact - http://buildcontext.com/blog/about\n\nv0.1 - Initial Working Alpha\nv0.2 - Updates from Fred Emmott - Rotation pauses if browser is being used, works on multiple windows.\nv0.3 - Added more options, some bug fixes. Now with clearer icons when Tabs is running, waiting and stopped.\nv0.5 - Updates from Aurimas Liutikas\nv0.6 - With Automatic Start and updated Options page.\nv0.7 - Significant updates from Wayne Goyer, advanced settings for each tab with highly requested features. \n\nIf you can help add features go for it!
