This is something thats probably useful for a developer or a QA who is testing multiple test instances of a website.\n\nFuture plans are to increase the history time period by adding a cache. Open to suggestions.\n\nThe code is open source, and is available at https://github.com/kavanpuranik/go-back-there"
