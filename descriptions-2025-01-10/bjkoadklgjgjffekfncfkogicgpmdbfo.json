With this extension, you can easily block access to distracting websites like social media and entertainment sites, so you can stay focused on what matters. Simply add URLs to the block list, and when you try to visit them, you'll be redirected to a custom \"Back to Work\" page, reminding you to stay productive. You can bypass the block for 15, 30 and 60 minutes whenever necessary, but the focus mode will quickly resume after that. Designed for simplicity and effectiveness, Focus Mode helps you take control of your online distractions, so you can make the most out of your time."
