This means that you can easily hide all the Shorts videos from your YouTube feed, without having to manually scroll through them.\n\nThe extension works by injecting a small JavaScript code into the YouTube page that automatically hides any video thumbnail with \"short\" in the URL. This feature can be toggled on and off using a convenient button in your browser's toolbar. The button color indicates whether the filter is currently active or not, so you can easily tell at a glance.\n\nWith the YouTube Filter Extension, you can enjoy a more streamlined YouTube experience that is free from unwanted Shorts videos. Give it a try and see how much easier it is to find the content that you want!"
