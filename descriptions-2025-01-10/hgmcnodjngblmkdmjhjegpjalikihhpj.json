Instead we have added an extra button next to that link where you are able to click a redirectional link that will direct you to to warcraftlogs (another website that displays more accurate information) instead of having to copy the username, going to the seperate website and then searching for the person. It is a huge timesaver compared to doing it the traditional way. The niche for people to use it is not very big, however for the people that are trying to find new users for their guild in World of warcraft will have a very much easier time finding the people that are desired for just their guild. Also adds a Wowprogress link on Raider io. Adds Warcraftlogs link directly on wowprogress aswell. also a Raider io link."
