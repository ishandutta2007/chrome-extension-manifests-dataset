This extension aims to address this difficulty by allowing users to increment their view a week at a time in a multi-week view.\n\nPress Ctrl+Down or Ctrl+Up to move 'down' or 'up' one week respectively. (Command+Down or Command+Up on macOS)\n\nFor this extension to work properly, you must set your Google Calendar's custom view to 2, 3, or 4 weeks (4 recommended).\n\nThis app works by modifying the URL of your tab. As such, the page is refreshed every time you increment by a week. Be aware that this means any unsaved changes to an event will be lost when you increment your view."
