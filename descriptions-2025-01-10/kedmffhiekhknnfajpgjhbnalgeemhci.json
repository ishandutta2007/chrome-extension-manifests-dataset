You can confidently skip it if the job is greyed out because you already looked at it before. This visual clue saves time scrolling through the search results and makes it less stressful.\n\n- **new jobs** - keep their original white background\n- **viewed jobs** - greyed-out\n\nFully opensource: https://github.com/rimutaka/upwork-browser-addon/"
