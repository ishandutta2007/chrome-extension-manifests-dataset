However, problems occur when you pause a video or start having multiple windows side by side – for example when you code along to the lectures in your editor.\n\nWhen you pause a video, redundant interface elements obstruct your view of the video – rather unpleasant when you try to read the source code underneath. At smaller window sizes other interface elements start to hover above the video player, even when it is playing – also a rather suboptimal learning experience.\n\nVideo Cleaner for Safari will remove those obstacles and improve your overall learning experience on Safari."
