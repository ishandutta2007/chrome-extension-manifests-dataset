Thus, 'TabIt - BookMarks' will make your Google Chrome even more beneficial.\n\nIt replaces the default manager, available at chrome://bookmarks, with the one, you will actually love to use.\n\nYou can have some folder to be the default(Home Folder) for you to open and save bookmarks to.\n\nThere are four options for bookmarks' thumbnails: Default, None, Captured & Branded. Default and Captured thumbnails are usually screenshots of the corresponding web-sites. Benefits of the 'branded' thumbnails are best revealed, when used in a 'Home Folder'.\n\nThree different layouts are available: Grid(of thumbnails), List & NarrowList(similar to the one in Chrome 62). 'TabIt - NewTab' comes in two themes - Light & Dark.\n\nSorting can be done in either: Old-to-New, New-to-Old or Alphabetic order + Put-Folders-First option.\n\nAvailable keyboard keys and ShortCuts are intuitive.\n\nONE MORE THING:  There is a browser-action dialog window, available through the extension-button, meant to replace a traditional 'star' button to create bookmarks. You can understand its functionality from the illustrations, but it's better to give it a try!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNOTE:  Functionality of this extension is necessary to the operation of 'TabIt - NewTab', which requires it installed and enabled.\n\nTabIt - NewTab:  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabit-newtab/nlpjfjjgmmpjbcjbnjklbggcancdaehm\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n***** WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT *****\n+ Own server-side thumbnails preparation service\n+ Drag&Drop to the TabIt - NewTab\n+ Drag&Drop to the BookmarksTree in a SideBar\n+ ContextMenu for the SideBar\n+ Fixation for custom width of the SideBar\n+ Availability of offline versions of bookmarked pages and files\n+ Better smoothness by animation\n+ Other prettification :)\n+ Your suggestions?\n\n***** DECLARED PERMISSIONS ***** UPDATES *****\nPlease, see detailed information about this extension here:  https://alexperience.me/projects/tabit/tabit-bookmarks"
