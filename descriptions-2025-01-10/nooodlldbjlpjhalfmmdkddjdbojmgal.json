Why did they leave...? In any case, we have fixed it.\n\nWith some of its latest changes, Google has decided to \"hide\" the number of results for any search and the number of indexed pages when searching with the command \"site:domain\"... But, that's OK! The INDEXED.pro team to the rescue with a brand new, free Google Chrome extension that allows SEO (and non-SEO) professionals to see again the number of results and the number of pages / URLs indexed on Google SERPs.\n\nHOW TO USE THIS FRIENDLY SEO EXTENSION\nVery easy: install it, activate it, perform any Google search and... VOILA! The number of search results and the number of indexed URLs (\"site:domain\" command) are back to where they were before Google's changes.\n\nNOTE: Yes, we know that Google's \"site:domain\" command is not as accurate when it comes to indexed pages as SEOs would like, but it's something, even if it's an estimate...)\n\nNOTE 2: Yes, we also know that 1 click on \"tools\" in the Google SERPs will show this information (number of results + number of indexed pages)... BUT, we also know that saving clicks makes life easier for SEOs.\n\nUse this Google Chrome extension and bring the number of results and number of indexed pages back to Google! View what's hidden without having to look for it.\n\nThis completely free Google Chrome extension has been developed by the INDEXED.pro team. INDEXED.pro is an SEO tool that monitors, automates and accelerates the indexing of URLs of any website (no matter the CMS or tech stack). It saves headaches when it comes to anything related to URL indexing (and almost 500 customers use it and love it)."
