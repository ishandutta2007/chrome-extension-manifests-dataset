Find where your name or brand is mentioned on a webpage or social media feed.  Also easily find any links to URLs that you specify are on the webpage as well.\n\nYou can blacklist domains the highlighting is paused when on those sites.  This is helpful if you're trying to highlight brand names, but want to ignore the highlighting when on the brand's own site (which would probably highlight everything)."
