You can use one of Logophile's 3 included word lists, or add words of your own. \n\nEach time you open a new tab, Logophile will select a new word from your list and display it on the screen. You can then click on the screen to reveal the definition and an example sentence (if available), then mark the word as 'Learned' once you've mastered it. You can add words manually in bulk, add them from a webpage you're reading, or from your Kindle. \n\nPick and choose from 20 different color options to spruce up your new tab, and expand your vocabulary at the same time!"
