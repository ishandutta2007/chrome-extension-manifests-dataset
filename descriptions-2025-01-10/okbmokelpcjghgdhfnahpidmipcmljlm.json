Think about it...if there are 10 people bidding on an auction and 1 of those people knows more than everybody else, who do you think is in the best position to win that auction?  The bidder who knows more than everybody else of course!  That's what makes this browser extension the real secret to win more on DealDash.  It will secretly arm with you an edge...knowing how many bids each and every other bidder has placed in total on any auction on DealDash.\n\nJust click the \"add to chrome\" button above to get started.  Once this extension has been added to your browser, you don't have to do anything else other than visit any auction on DealDash.com.  You'll notice that something is different about the auction page now...that a new column has been added to the area that shows the last ten bidders on the auction.  That new column contains the total count of bids placed by each bidder.  This information isn't \"retroactive\" in any way, but rather keeps tabs from when you get there going forward.  So the longer you stay on an auction page the more accurate the information will be.\n\nSo get yourself on your way to winning more auctions like the pro players do by using a \"dealdash secret weapon\"...knowing how many bids everybody else is placing and effectively being able to see their commitment level to winning an auction."
