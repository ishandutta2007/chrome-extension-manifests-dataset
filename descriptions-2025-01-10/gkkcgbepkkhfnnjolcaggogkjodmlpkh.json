The React Fiber contains information about the source code that will be added during development, so we use that information to open the editor.\n\nDetail: https://dev.to/handdot/published-chrome-extension-for-streamlined-react-development-23b\n\n■Options\nIt is possible to change the 'Open in Editor URL' from the extension's options page so that you can open it in an editor other than VSCode.\n\n■Source Code\nThis extension is Open source. so you can access from https://github.com/hand-dot/react-inspector.\nIf you find a bug, please report it via Github!"
