It offers a range of features that enhance your listening experience while providing seamless organization of your audiobook collection. \n\nFeatures:\nAudiobook Management:\nThe extension provides a user-friendly interface to organize and store audiobooks in separate internal directories. This ensures a clutter-free and organized library where you can locate and access your favorite titles.\n\nResumable Playback and Position Tracking:\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of audiobook reading is losing track of your progress when returning to a book. This extension eliminates that annoyance by automatically saving and tracking the position of each audiobook. You can seamlessly resume playback from where you left off, even if you switch between different books or close the extension.\n\nGlobal Media Key Support:\nIt supports global media keys, allowing you to play, pause, resume, and seek forward or backward using your keyboard's media control buttons. This feature provides a convenient and familiar way to manage your audiobook experience.\n\nNavigation and Section Replay:\nThere are specific buttons for moving forward or backward by either 10 seconds or 1 minute. You can use these buttons to quickly go back to important parts or skip through sections that aren't relevant.\n\nBook Ordering and Track Management:\nThe sidebar panel allows you to effortlessly change the order of books, ensuring your collection is arranged according to your preference. Furthermore, you can add, delete, or modify individual tracks within each audiobook, providing flexibility and customization options."
