The Gopher Grades website and extension can help with that by providing grade distribution data for each course on a per-instructor basis. This can be helpful in deciding which classes to take and which instructors to take them from. The data is based on GPA information from the past semesters.\n\nThis extension adds GopherGrades features directly into the UMN Schedule Builder tool, as well as adding a very convenient omnibox helper."
