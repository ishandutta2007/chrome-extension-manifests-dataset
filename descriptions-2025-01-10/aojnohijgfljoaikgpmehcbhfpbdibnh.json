This will work for games that have gone final, but also for games in progress! \n\nNote that the tempo-free stats will only be as good as the stats provided by ESPN. So to the extent those stats are wrong (or incomplete) the tempo-free stats may not be completely accurate. In particular, it may be that the the live box score stats will not include team rebounds and team turnovers. That will make the possession calculations inaccurate. But it's usually still pretty close.\n\nOn installation, this should start working automatically but you might need to manually refresh the boxscore page once or twice to kickstart things, and also you may need to refresh every once a while thereafter.\n\nNumber of possessions and auto-updates the stats every 15 seconds. You can also just click on the four-factors area to manually update to the latest available stats.\n\nNow works on women's NCAA boxscore pages as well."
