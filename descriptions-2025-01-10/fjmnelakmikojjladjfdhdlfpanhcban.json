It doesn't know what a character is. ChatGPT counts content in tokens. ChatGPT has a context window of how many tokesn it can remember.\n\nOpenAI is hiding what the context window is on the web version. ChatGPT 4o in Plus and Team should have a context window of 32,768 tokens (~24,000 words). 3 words ~ 4 tokens. When your conversation becomes longer than that, ChatGPT will start to \"forget\" what was discussed earlier.\n\nThe box in the corner of the window lets you monitor the token usage and ensure that the conversations do not exceed the context window, which is particularly important for coaching, idea generation, and working with longer articles where retaining the context is crucial.\n\nWith this extension, you will know when context can be missing and will have more productive and meaningful conversations with ChatGPT.\n\nThis extension is written 99% by ChatGPT. The logo icon is created 100% by MidJourney.\n\nThe number IS NOT exact but should be in the range of +/- a dozen."
