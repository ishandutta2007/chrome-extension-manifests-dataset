This behavior is extremely useful if you have the same page on different hosts.\n\nFor example, if you were to own example.com, local.example.com, and test.example.com, if you wanted to bookmark the /about page, you would generally need 3 bookmarks.\n\nWith Relative Bookmarks you can just bookmark /about and on whatever website you are on, you will navigate to /about.\n\nRelative Bookmarks also lets you bookmark only the query string of a page, with the ability of mixing and overriding query parameters.\n\nUsage\n- Click the Add relative bookmark\n- The bookmark will be immediately added\n- You can modify it by selecting a folder or changing the titles\n- Click Advanced to show the fields to modify each individual value\n- Click Done once you finished editing to save the changes\n- Click Remove if you would like to discard the current new bookmark"
