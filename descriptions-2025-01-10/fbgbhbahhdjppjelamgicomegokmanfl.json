I’m just here to help, no judgments.\nIf you like this extension and want more features like customizable boxes or multiple saved spots, let me know!\nAnd if you’d like to support this and other projects, consider donating: [Donate here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=V9VQDE3XNBQZU)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://shoopal.github.io/scroll-saver-privacy-policy/)"
