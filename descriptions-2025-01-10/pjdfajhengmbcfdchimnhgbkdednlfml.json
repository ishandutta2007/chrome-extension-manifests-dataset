Anytime your active tab is on one of these websites, the timer will continue. \n\nTimers will only continue if Chrome has focus. Additionally, all timers will restart once the total time hits 24 hours. \n\nKey features:\n- Set up alerts to remind you to go back to work after a certain time has been spent on a website\n- Download your data as a CSV file\n- See the percentage of your total work time spent on your websites\n\nSource Code:\nhttps://github.com/kashiish/time.ly"
