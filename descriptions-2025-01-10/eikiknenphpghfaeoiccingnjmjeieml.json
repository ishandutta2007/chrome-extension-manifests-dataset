Tons of sites, especially news sites, have these useless banners.\n\nThose things are so annoying! They take up a bunch of the screen and make it hard or sometimes impossible to read an article! Gah! Why would sites add these?!\n\nThis extension gets rid of those floating banners on the sites you specify.\n\n== How to use this extension ==\n\nClick the extension icon and then click the \"Remove banners\" button. Floating / sticky / fixed banners on the site you're browsing will be moved to the top and bottom of the page.\n\nThe page layout may be a little weird after you click the button. If it's too messed up, just refresh the page and please send me an email with the URL of the site and how it broke.\n\nOnce your refresh the page or visit the site again you'll have to click the button again. Let me know in an email if you don't want to click every time and want your preferences saved.\n\n== Not working? ==\n\nPlease send me an email so I can support you instead of leaving a bad review! Bugs can be fixed but bad reviews are forever."
