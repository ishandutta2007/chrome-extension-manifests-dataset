The fuzziness comes from trying to add potentially misspelled words and words that are often seen together in context (synonyms). \n\nThe former uses string edit distance while the latter uses Stanford's GloVe pre-trained word vectors. The dictionary file is included with the extension and so all searches are done locally. \n\nSource code: https://github.com/ijkilchenko/Fuzbal"
