Canvas does not currently have any mechanism to do this, so this extension makes it easier to get all of your course files at once instead of downloading them individually. \n\nYou can specify which courses to include and whichever file types you want excluded. Before you download, it shows all the files that you will download, their size, and from which courses they will come. It's very useful for downloading all lecture slides/videos before a final or for saving course content for the future. And when you're done with it, you can easily hide it whenever you want!"
