Once installed, navigate to the website hosting the JNLP file, and the JNLP Runner extension will automatically activate. A new Chrome tab will open, and after agreeing to the license, you'll see the options 'Start Application' and 'Download'. Simply click on 'Start Application', and the Java application will be executed within the browser.\n\nThe extension is private and secure, runs fully client-side (i.e. it does not contact any server), and does not collect any data or analytics at all. All your data, as well as your application are kept within the boundaries of your browser.\n\nThis extension, developed by Leaning Technologies, is based on CheerpJ, a JVM/JRE replacement for modern browsers.
