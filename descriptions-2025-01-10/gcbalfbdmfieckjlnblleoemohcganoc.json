Existing Selenium IDE scripts can be imported. Conversion help for iMacros scripts is provided, too.\n\n(2) Desktop Automation for Windows, Mac, and Linux\n\nBeyond web browser automation, Ui.Vision can interpret images and text on the desktop, executing actions like clicking, moving, dragging and dropping the mouse, and simulating keyboard inputs.\n\nThis desktop automation requires installing the free Ui.Vision XModules, available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. These modules provide Ui.Vision with the necessary capabilities for desktop interaction.\n\n(3) Anthropic Claude Computer Use Integration\n\nThe AI commands allow you to automate complex tasks with a single line of code that would traditionally require hundreds of lines of classic commands. For example, you can teach Ui.Vision to play TicTacToe with just one short \"Play this game...\" prompt.\n\n(4) Command Line API\n\nUi.Vision can be controlled from the command line. Thus it can be used from, and combined with,   any programming or scripting language, such as Windows batch files, Linux/Mac shell scripts, Python or PowerShell.\n\n(5) Open-Source \n\nUi.Vision is Open-Source. The source code is available on Github. \n\n(6) 100% Local Software\n\nThe software does not send any data back to us or any other place. Everything, including image recognition and OCR processing, is done locally on your machine. \n\nThe only exception to the \"all data is processed locally\" rule is if you select the optional AI commands. But these cloud-features are disabled by default. The default computer vision (image recognition and OCR) runs 100% locally on the machine.\n\n**Happy Automating!**\n\nFor questions and suggestions, please visit the Ui.Vision community forum at https://forum.ui.vision.",
    "de,zh_CN": "Kantu is the most popular open-source web macro recorder. If there’s an activity you have to do repeatedly, just create a web macro for it. The next time you need to do it, the entire macro will run at the click of a button and do the work for you.\n\nKantu's main focus is ease of use, good recording and reliable playback for all kinds of browser automation projects. It is a record & replay tool for automated testing and a \"swiss army knife\" for general web automation, automating file uploads and autofill form filling. It is also intended as an open-source alternative to iMacros and Selenium IDE.\n\nFirefox Selenium IDE users, please note: The current version supports the most commonly used \"Selenese\" commands, but not all. => We are adding new commands as needed. So if you miss a command that you need for your test automation work, please let us know.\n\nThe more feedback we get about a certain missing command or feature, the higher it moves in the \"todo\" list :-)\n\nPlease send feedback and questions to \nteam AT a9t9.com\n\nHomepage/Docs:\nhttps://a9t9.com/kantu/web-automation/chrome"
