All views are fully synchronized: scroll, fill-in form fields, click, hover and drag elements in one view and get instant feedback in all others.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Breakpoints View: displays resizeable view for each CSS media query breakpoint of your page. Contents of large viewports are dowscaled to fit your screen size.\n* Device Wall: birdâ€™s-eye overview of device-sized viewports. In this mode, each view is scaled according to <meta name=\"viewport\"> tag of your page and overrides User-Agent with real device value.\n* Create your own devices and presets for Device Wall.\n* PageSync engine synchronizes all user interaction across all viewports: not just scrolling, form fill and clicks but also mouse hover, movement and dragging."
