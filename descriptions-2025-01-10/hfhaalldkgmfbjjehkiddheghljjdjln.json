They continue to expand their list: http://theslot.jezebel.com/every-description-jezebel-used-for-donald-trump-during-1772372244. I have gathered more names from around the web, and will add new ones as I find them.\n  -- The image replacement idea came from  \"Trump Kittens\" Chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trump-kittens/ccghcnenefcpjjikaalmfkafenlhagpn)\n\n\n\n*** NOTE *** If you are wondering why it doesn't work on a particular site: \n\nDetrumpify was designed not to interfere with you. By default it only runs on a whitelisted list of websites that are baked into the config file. If you want it to run on all websites, choose the \"ignore whitelist\" option. You can also generate your own blacklist of specific sites that the extension should *not* run in, by entering them into the blacklist.\n\n\nVersions\n1.3.0 - update to manifest v3\n1.2.12 - allow users to hand-edit config again locally\n1.2.11 - minor fixes for people using custom config files\n1.2.10 - simplify the page running logic to allow user-editable whitelist or user-editable blacklist\n1.2.8 - fix bug with hyphens in blacklist. Turn off debug messages in console\n1.2.7 - new user configurable blacklist. Add type in hostnames for sites you don't want detrumpified, or click a button to add the current page to the list.\n1.2.6 - click detrumpified images to see the original trumpy image\n1.2.5 - new feature! \"Bard Mode\" under Mock-O-Matic.
