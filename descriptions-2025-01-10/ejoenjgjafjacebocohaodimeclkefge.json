Open the popup to see a breakdown of all network requests—such as scripts, images, stylesheets, and more — along with their status codes, load times, and whether or not they’re served from cache.\n\nDetailed Resource Dashboard\nInstantly see all network requests grouped by category (Script, Image, StyleSheet, etc.).\n\nFiltering & Search\nNarrow down requests by success or error codes, or quickly locate resources by name/URL.\n\nGraph Visualization\nA timeline-like bar chart highlights all requests in chronological order, color-coded by status.\n\nAccordion-Style Groups\nCollapse or expand entire resource categories to keep your view clutter-free.\n\nHow It Works\n\n1. Install the Extension: Add Resonance to Chrome.\n2. Open the Popup: Click the Resonance icon to open a dashboard showing requests made by the current page.\n3. Real-Time Updates: See new requests appear automatically, along with their load times and status codes.\n4. Filter & Search: Quickly zero in on errors, or type a keyword to find particular files.\n\nPrivacy & Data\n\nResonance does not send your browsing data to any external servers. All collected information (network requests, statuses, etc.) is stored locally in chrome.storage."
