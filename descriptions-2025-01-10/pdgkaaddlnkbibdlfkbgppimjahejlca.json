Your favorite movies, TV shows, comic books, video games, songs, albums, music artists, bands, animals, cities, … the list goes on and on.\n\nBut it is fairly new, partially still in development or otherwise sub-optimal. Their small development team is busy with all sorts of implementation jobs and making the website grow with little new features in general. This is where I step in.\n\nFLEX is a one-man endeavor to improve the browsing experience with this particular website. Ranging from bug fixes over usability enhancements to useful features that I came up with on my own, this extension tries to make life a little bit easier."
