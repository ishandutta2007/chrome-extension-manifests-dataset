The extension allows users to connect to the Optimizely API using an API key, which can be obtained from the Optimizely platform. Once connected, the extension allows the user to search for A/B tests and feature tests by experiment name. This allows users to quickly and easily find the specific A/B tests or feature tests that they need to work on, without having to navigate through the Optimizely platform.\n\nAdditionally, the extension also allows users to retrieve information about the different variations of an A/B test or feature test, including their names, description, and status. This information can be used to compare the performance of different variations of a website.\n\nThe extension also allows you to test whitelisted users, where you can run an A/B test or feature test directly in your browser. This means you can test different variations of a website without having to make the changes live on the website. This can be useful for developers and testers who want to test changes before they are released to the public.\n\nOverall, the Toggle Experiment extension makes it easy for users to manage and test A/B tests and Feature tests within the Optimizely platform by utilizing its API. This can save time and improve efficiency for web developers and testers who need to work with A/B tests and feature tests on a regular basis.\n\nThe Chrome extension is not from Optimizely itself and has nothing to do with Optimizely. Additionally, the extension is open source, which means that the code is publicly available and can be modified by anyone on GitHub. This allows developers to easily improve the extension and add new features as needed.\n\nGitHub page:\nhttps://github.com/aaron5670/toggle-experiments-extension"
