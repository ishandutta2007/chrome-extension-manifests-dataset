This means that the extension will not paraphrase or change the meaning of emails, but rather extracts key sentences from the given email.\n- summarize.me works perfectly with English language. Unfortunately, the application doesn't work flawlessly with other languages.\n\n[WHAT'S NEW?] Update 1.0.0\n- Now, you are able to use the summarize.me features right inside the Gmail application with no need to open the extension popup constantly. To use this feature, simply open the extension once before you session, and enjoy this feature!"
