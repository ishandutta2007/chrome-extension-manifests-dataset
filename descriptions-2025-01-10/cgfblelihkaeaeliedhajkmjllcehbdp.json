That might mean, a business has changed location or name, but hasn't updated the records yet. Also, some restaurants might use a slightly different name on each takeaway to potentially attract customers, which could lead to mismatches.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/argyakrivos/takeaway_scores_on_the_doors\n\n*** Version 2.0.0\n\n  - Added support for Deliveroo Scores on the Doors\n  - Renamed the extension to Takeaway Scores on the Doors\n  - Added rating on the restaurant page for JUST EAT\n  - Minor bug fixes\n\n*** Version 1.1.0\n\n  - Improved accuracy of results by looking for nearby restaurants in case postcode does not match\n  - Minor performance improvements\n\n*** Version 1.0.0\n\n  - First app release\n  - Support for JUST EAT Scores on the Doors"
