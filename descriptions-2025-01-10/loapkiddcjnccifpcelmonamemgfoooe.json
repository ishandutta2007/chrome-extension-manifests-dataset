This extension offers two extra functionalities:\n\n1. The user can insert custom CSS styling rules to each page.\n2. The dark them can get enabled and disabled automatically based on the daylight and nightlight period that the user is set on the options page\n\nNote:\n1. This theme is based on the \"invert\" filter. Basically, this extension inverts the entire page and then revert some elements to feel like a real dark theme. To alter more elements use the custom CSS section of the options page.\n\nLegal:\nThis extension is an independent project to invert the  Instagram? website and has nothing to do with Instagram? and its development team."
