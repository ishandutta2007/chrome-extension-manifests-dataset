Clicking on a folder name will randomly select a bookmark from that bookmark folder and load it up.\n\nFeatures a \"Recently Used\" history and some swell options to entertain you!\n\nThe name is based on the Mandarin word for \"whatever\", which is normally romanized as \"suíbiàn\".\n\n===\nCHANGELOG\n===\nv0.0.5\n2015-02-22\n- Added an \"Exclude Folders\" list to the options menu, to allow you to hide certain folders from Swaybien.\n- Fixed a bug in the \"Recent\" list that would display the old folder name even after a folder had been renamed.\n\nv0.0.2.5\n2014-10-11\nAdded two options:\n- You can specify the number of items to display in the \"Recent\" list.\n- Items that appear in the \"Recent\" list can optionally be excluded from the main list.\n\nv0.0.2.2\n2014-10-04\n- Small bug fix related to using the extension across multiple windows, with the \"open in current tab\" setting. Previously only the first window opened would have its current tab updated; this fix properly updates the current tab in the current window.\n\nv0.0.2.1\n- Small bug fix related to formatting on the Recent section.\n\nv0.0.2\n- Added an option (enabled by default) to display the three most-recently clicked folders at the top of the popup.\n\nv0.0.1.1\n2014-07-27\n- Popup window now closes automatically when opening bookmarks in current tab."
