The tasks include watching scary videos at odd hours in the morning, listening to psychedelic music, inflicting cuts on various parts of the body and ultimately, committing suicide. These tasks are usually administered by a \"curator\" who uses social media to contact potential players. Users expressing their willingness to play by using hashtags such as \"#i_am_whale\" and \"#curatorfindme\" to garner the attention of curator.\nThis research intends to find users who post about the deadly Blue Whale Challenge and remove/hide posts relating to the challenge from the Twitter feed of susceptible users."
