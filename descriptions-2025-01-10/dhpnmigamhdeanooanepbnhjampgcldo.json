As soon as you land on a page, it automatically prepares the first typing spot for you, saving you a click and letting you get started immediately. This is especially handy on search engines, forms, and login pages.\n\nNo more shifting between your mouse and keyboard, a small yet significant step towards a smoother, more ergonomic browsing experience. This can be a relief for individuals who find constant switching between keyboard and mouse taxing, or for those concerned about repetitive strain injuries such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.\n\nTypeReady is designed for ease of use. Once installed, it works in the background requiring no further interaction. It's a small tweak to your browsing habit, but over time, it significantly enhances your overall online efficiency."
