Do you feel anxiety by the unread count on your Gmail Inbox continuously ticking up while you are trying to get the work done?\n\nIf yes, then this simple Chrome Extension is for you. The extension adds a on/off button to your Google Chrome toolbar. When switched on, the extension overrides the Inbox link while in Gmail to a link with your current emails pausing further delivery of emails in your browser. This allows you to address your previous emails with a cool mind without getting disturbed continuously by new email arrivals or the unread count jumping on the Inbox.\n\nWhen you need your Inbox back, simply click the on/off button again and your Inbox link is brought back to you.\n\nPlease note no emails are lost while you have paused them. As soon as you switch off the pause functionality, you get your Inbox back with your updated emails.\n\nAs it sits today, this is a very simple extension concentrating on one single task. If you would like to suggest a feature request to make it more useful to you, please send the same at support at imbibe dot in."
