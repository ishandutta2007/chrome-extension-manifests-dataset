When the extension is enabled, it switches insecure \"HTTP\" pages to the secure \"HTTPS\" alternative when the server supports secure communication. In oppose to the popular HTTPS Anywhere extension, this one does not have a predefined set of sites that support HTTPS protocol, instead, it evaluates the unsecured site upon the first usage.\n\nSource code and bug tracker are available at:\nhttps://github.com/balvin-perrie/http-to-https\n\nNotes:\n1. If automatic switching to HTTPS protocol for a website causes it to look broken, use the toolbar popup to add the page or the hostname to the exception list and reload the page in the HTTP protocol.\n2. You can place your mouse over the toolbar button to get more info about the color codes that this extension uses. Also, make sure to read the FAQs page.\n\nLogs:\nv0.1.1\n1. Do not redirect *.onion websites based on https://github.com/balvin-perrie/http-to-https/issues/2"
