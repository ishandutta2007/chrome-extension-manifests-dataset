It allows users to make easier, faster, and better decisions based on data provided by PlanetTerp.  Rather than navigating between tabs to properly vet prospective instructors based on their ratings and student reviews, you can conduct all of that natively within the webpage.  With a sleek interface, matching design, and smooth transitions, Testudo++ feels like it's supposed to belong there.  It's able to provide the additional information students value to determine whether they want to register for a specific course or professor.\n\nFeatures:\n- Displays average course GPA\n- Course link navigates you to the corresponding PlanetTerp course website\n- Professor links\n    - PlanetTerp link navigates you to the corresponding PlanetTerp professor page\n    - RateMyProfessor link navigates you to the corresponding RateMyProfessor professor page\n- Professor ratings show the average student ratings given to that professor\n    - Intuitive matching color gradient to indicate positive/negative scale (green, yellow, red)\n- Scrollable professor reviews window\n    - Able to filter by professor\n        - Organized by active/inactive instructor status\n        - View by grouping\n        - Sorted alphabetically\n    - Able to sort by 'Most Recent', 'Most Critical', and 'Most Favorable'\n    - Additional information popup window\n\nv1.1 Update:\n- Ability to sort course listing by GPA or Credit Count\n- Button to share a clean link of specific courses\n\nThis project is open-source.\nhttps://github.com/RocketSandwich/TestudoPlusPlus"
