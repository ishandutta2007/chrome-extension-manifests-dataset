Now, I've had to say this a few times now, but this is the final time I will say this. #SHUT UP about my head. It is normal. It is a nice head. It does not look like a sodding Tic Tac! I don't think you know who you're dealing with here... look how tall I am! 6'5\", look at me, I'm ... like a beast! You don't want to be mocking me I tell ya! And you're idiots all of you the people who are mocking me, you look like spazmoids, one of em looks like a jacket potato with glasses on his head, and I swear there's ginger people trying to mock me! You know, I'm not the kind of person you want to be messing with, I don't like cats. I don't think kittens and puppy dogs are cute, in fact I think all cats are dickheads if I'm honest with ya. Like, when I see em in my garden, I'm not cooing over them, I run out there and\n\nAH!\nScare em away... so you wanna think carefully before you start mocking my head again, because I'm taking names down, and I will shame you all in a video, I will. You wouldn't be saying this if you were standing in front of me, you'd be cowering! You know, when I eat peanut M&Ms, I crush each one in my fingers, so I'm strong, you know what I mean? You need to stop this stupidity, or there will BE consequences. Names are taken, and you will be shamed in a video. That's all I've got to say"
