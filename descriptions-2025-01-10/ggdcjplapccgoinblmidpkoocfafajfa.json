In Domain Blocker you build the blocklist as you go along.\n\n🚀 Hide ads\n  ⭐️ by blocking advertisement domains you disable the display of some of those pervasive ads\n\n🚀 Avoid tracking\n  ⭐️ by blocking tracking domains you prevent the services to acquire information about your browsing behaviour\n\n🚀 Load pages faster\n  ⭐️ by blocking unnecessary domains (requests) you save traffic and make pages loading faster!\n\n🚀 Fight procrastination\n  ⭐️ just keep facebook.com out of the Whitelist and... do more!\n\n🚀 Permissions explained\n  ⭐️ \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\": to be able to intercept HTTP request before they leave your browser\n\nCompletely free and with no ads\n\nMade with ♥ by Peta Sittek"
