Plus, GMass uses Google API to send emails, with no support for smart schedule or smart send, thereby not getting the same inbox delivery / open rates as MagicEmails.\n\nMixMax: Uses an external portal to send campaigns. Campaigns are triggered via APIs / SMTP server and make it difficult from inbox delivery rate. Pricing is super expensive."
