The extension is designed to help users identify legitimate projects and prevent scams and phishing attacks. The extension would work by checking the authenticity of the project's smart contract on the blockchain and verifying that it is indeed the original project.\n\nTrustOn checks the history of the smart contract, such as the number of transactions, the volume of transfers and the addresses involved. This could give an idea of the popularity and the overall adoption of the project.\n\nOur database maintains a blacklist of risky or fraudulent smart contract addresses and provide you the tools you need to verify the authenticity of any contract you interact with.\n\nMoreover, TrustOn will provide a way for users to report suspicious activity or scams they come across while using the extension. This would allow the extension to be constantly updated with new information and improve its ability to identify and prevent scams.\n\nOverall, this extension would provide an extra layer of security for users interacting with Web3 projects, helping to protect them from scams and phishing attacks, and allowing them to confidently invest in legitimate projects."
