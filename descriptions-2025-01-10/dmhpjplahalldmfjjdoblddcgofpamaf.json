It does not attempt to offer a full suite of layout options, but sticks to a simple and easy-to-use subdivision method. Breakpoints can be set, visualised and previewed, dummy content can be added, and the complete source can be exported for viewing in other devices and browsers.\n\nLayoutifier is not intended as a tool for producing framework code for a production website, but rather to facilitate conversation between technical and non-technical members of a web design/development team. Proposed designs can be mocked-up, tested for unexpected problems, refined and accepted without the overheads of having a developer manually code each iteration of the mock-up."
