In future it should allow to search history and external sites in one go of  course)\n\nmany smiles to you! \n\n---\n\nAlso coinsider joining us please. We fulfill wishes since ~10 years https://github.com/code-charity . Unfortunately we lost our main developer r in 2022 :(\n\nAnd compare with our  slightly older DEMO without indexedDB \n\nI think we shouldnt reinvent the wheel either way, but use the most powerful JS lib for search with \"(no)SQL\" queries and more!\n\nWhile july26 (above) is the most functional we got, the current master.zip already has great GUI updates/enhancements. Please help us pick up/carry on our GUI lib too: https://github.com/code-for-charity/SATUS",
