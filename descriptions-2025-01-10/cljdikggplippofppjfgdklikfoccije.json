This allows users to easily navigate through the bookmark system and find the bookmark they are looking for.\n\n‚ÄúList view‚Äù  (üìÑ) is a type of bookmark organization method that displays the contents of a directory in a list format.\n\n\"Searching for bookmarks\" is allows users to quickly and easily find a specific webpage that they have previously saved as a bookmark. This can be a useful feature for users who have a large number of bookmarks saved in their browser, as it allows them to find the bookmark they are looking for without having to manually scroll through a long list of bookmarks.\n\nThe \"Prev\" and \"Next\" buttons can be used to navigate through the bookmarks in the order they were saved, which can be helpful when you have a lot of bookmarks and you want to go back and forth between them.\n\nThe \"Edit\" option allows users to make changes to the properties of a bookmark, such as the name of the bookmark, the URL it points to, and the folder it is saved in. This can be useful when a bookmark's URL changes, or when you want to change the name of a bookmark to better reflect the content of the webpage it points to.\n\nThe \"Delete\" option allows users to remove a bookmark from their browser. This can be useful when a bookmark is no longer needed, or when a user wants to clean up their list of bookmarks.\n\nAdding a \"new folder\" and a \"new bookmark\" in a web browser is a simple process that can help users organize their bookmarks and easily find the web pages they are looking for.\n\n\"Opening a new tab of a saved bookmark\" in your browser is a quick and easy way to access a webpage that has been previously saved as a bookmark."
