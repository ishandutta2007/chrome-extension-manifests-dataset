I personally believe that there is so much inaction in the world, and I want to build something that is able to drive people to do more and love more. I wish to encourage others to explore more of what the world has to offer and showcase a different perspective of viewing the world through imagery and photography. A bible verse with a visually inspiring background photo is displayed when users open a new tab in Chrome with the extension enabled.\n\n\"If God is for us, who can be against us?\" - Romans 8:31"
