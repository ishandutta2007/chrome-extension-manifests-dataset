It is recommended to run crawls in incognito mode to avoid logging you out from all of your sites.\n\nIt also patches the Javascript environment to\n\n  - determine which functions and objects are accessed;\n  - make time faster, since some trackers are set to load pixels and Javascript after a delay, and crawling takes too long if we waited in real time.\n\nTherefore to avoid strange behaviour on sites, it's recommended to only have this extension enabled when you are crawling."
