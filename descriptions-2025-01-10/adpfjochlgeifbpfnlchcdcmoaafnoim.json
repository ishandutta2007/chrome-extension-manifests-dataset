If you do \"pinches\", it will not respond, because the pinch is reserved for zooming the page.\n\nYou can also configure how many fingers are required to perform gestures in case 2 fingers is too easy to accidentally activate.\n\nYou can also configure how long the fingers need to travel (in pixels) before a gesture is recognized. The default is 110 pixels which is suitable for medium-sized devices.\n\nYou don't need to lift your fingers at the end for the gesture to recognize. Just keep moving them in the desired direction and once it reaches the threshold the gesture will activate automatically."
