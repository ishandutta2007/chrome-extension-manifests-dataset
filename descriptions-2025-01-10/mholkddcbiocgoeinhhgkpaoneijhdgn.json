This means it will remove all of the clutter like recently visited, Google search, Google doodles, account options, notifications, etc from the page. This will allow you to load the New Tab page much quicker. In addition, as mentioned above, it is made to work seamlessly with my original Fluttershy theme.\n\nThe awesome background was made by Chromiapegasus (http://chromiapegasus.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-wallpaper-450188742) so check her out!"
