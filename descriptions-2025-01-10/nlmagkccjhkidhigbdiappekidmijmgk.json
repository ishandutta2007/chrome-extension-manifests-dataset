Getting your work the attention it deserves, though – requires a little grunt work on your part.  \n\nWith KDROI however, book marketing is no longer a tedious task.\n\nKDROI can help you:\n\nImprove Your Book – In order to sell a large volume of books, you first need to gain attention from your target audience with your book title and cover. Your task then ... is to build interest and desire in what you have to offer. These elements all come down to adopting \"empathy\" with your readers. We'll help you achieve that with QA analysis in any niche market.\n\nPromote Your Book – Without an email list, a powerhouse publisher behind you, or an advertising budget ... it can be daunting to know how to get your book in front of readers. Fortunately, there are many websites online that have large audiences – pre-disposed to hearing about book discounts and special offers.  We'll submit your book to them in minutes.\n\nGenerate Keywords – Many top-selling books you see today ... are there because they make use of the excellent Amazon advertising (AMS) platform. The hard part? Generating enough keywords to test on their platform to find them \"gems\".  With KDROI, however – you now have a simple way to generate 1000+ targeted keywords for your book which you can test on Amazon.\n\nWe're constantly updating KDROI to make your experience the best it can be. If you have any questions of feedback, we'd love to hear it. You can always get it touch at: support@publishingaltitude.com"
