The latest images from Rincon Surf Report are fetched from the source each time the user accesses the extension, while at the same time the surf report of the north-west coast of Puerto Rico is being fetched from the surfline page. \n\nOnce fetched, the system advises the user the state of the images. Hence if a new Report has been updated the system displays a message indicating that new information was fetched, if no information the system will also advise if no new information was found. \n\nWhen loaded, the user can choose from waiting for the automatic iteration between the images or by traversing through them by pressing the arrows on any of the sides. \n\nThe surf data is displayed on the second tab. The user can select between the four available regions, while the information is fetched, a loading screen with the Extension's logo will appear on screen, and the regions buttons will be disabled. \n\nWhen the system detects no-internet connection it proceeds to try and access the last images stored on local-storage (if any). \n\nAll of the information on the Extension belongs to the respective owners. WCSC fetches what is available on each of the mentioned pages, storing only the path of the image as is it displayed on the page."
