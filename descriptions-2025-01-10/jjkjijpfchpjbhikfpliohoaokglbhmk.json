If you need more granular data, the extension can lead you to Open Source Select for more detailed information.\n\nThe three types of metrics you can examine are:\nCommunity - How healthy the community around a project is. \nPopularity - Is it used by many? Is the usage declining? \nSecurity - How well does the maintainers apply security best practices.\n\nThe extension now supports Start Left Policies. This lets you immediately see if the open source you are browsing is compliant with your companyâ€™s open source policy, without the need to import and scan code with Software Composition Analysis tools and common source code repositories and package registries such as GitHub, pypi, npmjs, nuget and many others are supported."
