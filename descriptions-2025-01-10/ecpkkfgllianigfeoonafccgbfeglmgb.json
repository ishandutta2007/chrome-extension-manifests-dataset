Focus blocks distracting websites, while allowing you access to the sites you need. Focus lets you do better work in less time.\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE \n\nDo you work or study on your computer? \n\nThen you’ve been distracted by news, social media, shopping, email.  These distractions lead you to drift off-task, waste time, and end up unproductive and unfulfilled.  We’ve all been there. \n\nThe temptation of opening a new browser tab  to find a new distraction is strong and the action is often compulsive. \n\nWe all have specific sites that are our go-to distractions, but we also know that anything we click has the potential to become a distraction. except for the tools we’re using to get our work or studying done.\n\nTHE ANSWER \n\nFocus by Freedom blocks only those distracting websites so that you can focus on your work or studies. You tell Focus what sites you do need for work or schoolwork, and it will block everything else. You’ll stay focused and on-task, while doing high quality work because of your sustained attention. What’s more, you’ll find you can get more done in less time without those constant online interruptions!\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nFocus by Freedom blocks websites by placing them behind a PIN.  \n\nEASY SETUP – create a PIN (a password) and decide which websites should be allowed\nCUSTOMIZABLE - Focus comes pre-populated with an Allow List of common work and learning sites. You can customize as needed. \nACCOUNTABILITY - A parent can set the PIN for children, or you can have  your spouse or friend set the PIN for you\n\nWHO SHOULD USE FOCUS? \n\n- Remote workers, from home or in hybrid working situations \n- Students doing homework\n- Students with online or remote learning \n- Writers, Teachers, Entrepreneurs, Editors, Researchers, Journalists, and Developers all use Focus to get their work done!\n\nFocus is a product of Freedom Labs, where we develop new ways to meaningfully interact with technology.  Like our other extensions, Focus is highly privacy-conscious. None of your data is sent anywhere (the cloud, our servers, etc.) It remains secure on your own device. You can learn more about Freedom here: https://freedom.to\n\nRelease notes: Focus 1.0.3 fixes two issues:\n\n- Sometimes, the extension disables itself automatically and bypasses the green screen when visiting a blocked website\n- Sometimes, when adding a new website to the allowed list, it does add it, but it's not shown in the list\n\n Please send us your feedback at support@freedom.to and we'll continue to improve Focus.  Thank you!"
