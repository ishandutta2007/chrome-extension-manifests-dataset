By installing this extension, a self-censoring font will redact all content across the web (even what you type!), based on a database of censored keywords curated for this project.\n\nThis critical design practice is based on the emerging field of design activism and is part of Crystian Cruz's PhD research at the University of Newcastle, Australia. This project explores the potentiality of visual narratives as a medium to provoke debates regarding the consequences of censorship. \n\nThe database of censored keywords was sourced from more than 15,000 censorial documents available at the Brazilian National Archive and private collections of publishing houses. The censored terms are currently available in English and Portuguese. To find more about the censored terms and their origins, please visit www.censurativa.org and our social media accounts @censurativa"
