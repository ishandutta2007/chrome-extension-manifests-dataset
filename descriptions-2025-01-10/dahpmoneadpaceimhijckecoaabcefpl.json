Fill in the inputs that appear, then click the extension again to see your hilarious results.\n\nThis is an open-source project.  Check out the repo to contribute!\n\nhttps://github.com/xaroth8088/fill-in-the-blanks\n\nNote: Does not work will all websites, and is especially tuned for English-language content.  News stories on https://www.npr.org/ tend to work pretty well with this extension."
