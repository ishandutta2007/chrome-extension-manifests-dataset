Auto Checkout Tool for Amazon, BestBuy, EVGA, and Newegg (US & Canada)\n    2. Inventory Map for BestBuy (US only; Canada coming soon)\n\nSearch for purchasable \"backroom\" inventory at BestBuy stores near you. These highly constrained items cannot be found online or by a phone call to the store. You can use this extension to see if any store in your area has any PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and graphics cards that you can purchase in store. Set up personalized notifications so that you don't miss another restock.\n\nJoin the thousands of happy customers who've used the GPU Drops stock monitoring and checkout service to finally get their hands on the latest and greatest gaming and mining hardware!\n\nFor tips & tricks, suggestions, and/or technical issues, join our Discord community at https://discord.gg/gpudrops"
