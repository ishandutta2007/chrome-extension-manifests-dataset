No more searching in a huge pile of random files.\n\nWhile Download Organizer is active, every time you download something and a rule is set up for that file type, it will be redirected to your specified folder. You don't need to manually create those folders, they will be generated automatically. You don't need to create rules for each file type in particular, general types like \"Images\" or \"Audio\" are available.\n\nIf you need support for less common file types, you can include them by specifying them in the \"Advanced\" section.\n\nFor bug reports and suggestions, check the GitHub page: https://github.com/MireaRadu/download-organizer"
