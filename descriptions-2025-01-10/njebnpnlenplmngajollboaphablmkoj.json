Maybe he’s a robot layered with organic material to look like a man. Maybe he’s a man who was given robotic enhancements to fight like a killing machine. Either way, he’s a combat expert like the world has never seen. As the Cyber Soldier, your job is to blast and bludgeon your way through hordes of clunky and metallic enemies. They aren’t strictly “organic,” either. It’s a real war of technology in this high-stakes action game, and the only way for you to survive is to eliminate everyone else, run and jump through toxic environments and make your way to the goal.\nWe’ve all seen classic “shoot-em-up” titles, but we love Cyber Soldier because of the space-aged theme. It adds a nice layer of variety to the usual run-and-gun play style. Instead of some muscled-up commando or gun-slinging cowboy (even though both are awesome), your character seems like a time-traveling techno warrior sent to wipe out an entire army of enemy cyber soldiers. From the sound your blaster makes to the high-tech levels that you’re fighting your way through, everything about this game seems so futuristic, and we love it. Of course, you won’t get to enjoy it for too long if you can’t fight your way out, so let’s go over some pro tips for staying alive.\n\n\nTo swipe Install this extension to play Cyber Soldier Game or offline with no additional downloads and no ads. \n\nYou can contact with us support@724fun.com and share your thoughts and problems\n\nAfter clicking the add the game to chrome button, you can find the game in the extensions section.
