Now you can upload hex files on the go with your Google Chromebook or Chrome browser, without having to install Arduino IDEs or AVRDude. Simply plug in your USB Arduino, launch the app, select a hex file, and click upload. Currently tested on Arduino Uno, but most other boards should work.\n\nLooking for a compiler to write your sketches? Check out my other Chrome App ChromeDuino, an IDE, USB uploader, and Terminal for Chromebook and Chrome browsers.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- USB serial support for any system that runs the Chrome browser. Especially Chromebook, Chromebox, etc! No plug-in required.\n\n- A \"Reset\" button which can reset your Arduino software\n\n- A \"Test\" button which runs a small suite of commands to test connectivity\n\n- An \"Upload\" button which can program your Arduino with a .hex file\n\nNote that you must have an already compiled version of your Arduino sketch before you can upload the software! AVRChick does not feature a compiler and is not a substitute for an Arduino IDE. If you are looking for an Arduino IDE for Chromebook, check out my other Chrome app ChromeDuino -- the full IDE and compiler.\n\nNot currently supported (but coming soon):\n\n- Compiled sketches that contain EEPROM data stored in the Intel HEX (.hex) file\n\n- The configuration of fuses \n\n- Upload verification \n\n- Flash download from the Arduino/AVR\n\n- No verification of flash space available vs. hex file size\n\nCaution: \n\nWhile serial binary uploads are mostly harmless, take care that you upload the proper hex file for your device type. Use at your own risk."
