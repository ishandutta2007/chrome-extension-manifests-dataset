The bot translation message will be assigned to the original poster message so that it's less of a clutter.\n\nJust go to a channel that is using a translation bot and click on the extension icon and then write the name of the bot.\n\nYou can also right click the extension icon and got to the \"Options\" menu. There are some options to hide translation messages you don't want to see or change how the translation is displayed.\n\nNote: If the streamer doesn't activate the \"Show_ByName\" option of their translation bot, this extension will simply assign the translation message to the last received message since it doesn't know who the translation is for."
