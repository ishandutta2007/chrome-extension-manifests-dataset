Work smarter with your own customized rubric criteria, personalized AI feedback and annotations, plagiarism check, grade estimate and AI writing detection on essays.\n\nWhy do teachers choose GradeAssist over other tools like ChatGPT?\nGradeAssist Agent has advanced features for teachers that other products lack, such as the Chrome Extension Agent for grading essays in a single click, integrated plagiarism checking, and AI detection, and Playback Writing. Unlike other products, which requires manual essay uploads, GradeAssist operates directly in your browser, saving valuable time.\n\nHow is it different from ChatGPT?\nGradeAssist is a specialized platform of tools designed to assist educators in grading essays with responsible and secure use of AI, whereas ChatGPT is a general purpose chatbot.\n\nAlthough ChatGPT can provide general feedback on essays, it makes it hard to pinpoint specific areas for improvement.

GradeAssist offers consistent outcomes instantly without any complicated setup and annotations so teachers can instantly see successes and issues, saving hours of time.\n\nHow does it know the criteria?\nGradeAssist adapts to your unique rubric, analyzing student work solely based on the criteria you provide, ensuring accurate, personalized grading.

We believe that the professional judgement of teachers is key to fair grading, which is why our tools only use the criteria and grade level provided by the teacher to evaluate work.\n\nWe acknowledge the biases that generative AI technology may introduce, which is why we rigourously test our systems, and always remind our users that teachers are the final decision-makers.\n\nWill GradeAssist replace teachers?\nAbsolutely not. GradeAssist enhances your ability to provide fair and efficient grading, reinforcing the essential role of teachers in providing the best guidance and growth for students."
