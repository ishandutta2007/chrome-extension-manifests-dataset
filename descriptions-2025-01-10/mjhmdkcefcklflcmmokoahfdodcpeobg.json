Did I mention it's free and OSS?\n\nFeatures:\n- Complete control of personalisation of every element.\n- With the right settings, you can also achieve light theme too.\n- Quickly paint groups of colors with the Group Painter.\n- Quickly paint the entire site with the Update All button.\n- Individual control of every possible element (change the color of any individual element without affecting the rest)\n- Suggest colors that match the color you picked.\n- Custom CSS to modify each button to each div just the way you like it.\n- Free and Open-source and will always be.\n\nThis project is not affiliated, associated, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with GitHub, Inc. and Git, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates."
