For example, on a news webpage, images among the news article are of type A. Beside the article, there are usually one or two sidebars that display relevant news, and images in this area belong to type B. After telling this extension the type of your target images, it can download all images of the same type with one click.\n\nSteps to use:\n1. Get the type of images you want to download: click the \"Capture\" button, then click any of your target images. This image's type will be analyzed and filled automatically in the \"Image Type\" input box.\n2. Click the \"Download\" button. All images of the above type will be downloaded to your browser's default download directory. \n(For a better user experience, please uncheck \"Ask where to save each file before downloading\" in browser settings.)\n\nOther functions: \n1. Accuracy: increase this value, images about to download may be less but more accurate; decrease this value, more but less accurate images may be downloaded. After changing this value, remember to use the \"Capture\" button again.\n2. \"File Name\" input box: If you want to name the images about to download with a uniform prefix name, type the name in this input box. If you leave this box blank, all images will have default names.\n3. \"Folder Name\" input box: If you want a new folder to be created in your default download directory to store images about to download, type the name in this input box. If you leave this box blank, all images will be downloaded right in browser's default download directory.\n\nGenerally, once you have captured an image type on one website, you don't need to capture it again whenever you want to download images. Just click on the \"Download\" button. Because the type information has been saved in this extension and it is universal within this website. However, if you need to download images from another website, remember to use the \"Capture\" button first.\n\nIf you encounter any issues (e.g. this extension doesn't work on a specific webpage), or have any suggestions, please leave your comment."
