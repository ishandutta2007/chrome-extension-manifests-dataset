Users can add their preferred websites to the proxy list while excluding others, granting them total control over their browsing experience. \n\nFast4Proxy enhances online security and privacy by allowing users to proxy sensitive websites while keeping non-sensitive ones direct. With easy site management, users can update their preferences on the go.\n\nFast4Proxy is a Chrome extension that doesn't provide a built-in proxy server or VPN. Users must set it up with trusted proxies (Authentication is supported), as it won't unblock sites or ensure privacy on its own. Use personal or reputable public proxies (with caution) from Free Proxy List Websites. Fast4Proxy won't shield against harmful proxies injecting ads, tracking, or recording passwords\n\nFast4Proxy is absolutely free and open source. It does not insert ads into any website. It contains absolutely no malware. It just does proxy configuration, and aims to be perfect tool of that.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://github.com/Timeo1210/Fast4Proxy/blob/master/PRIVACY.md\n\nSource Code : https://github.com/Timeo1210/Fast4Proxy"
