It can help you answer questions like…\n\n- Are my students engaged in the work that I've assigned?\n- Are they managing their time?\n- Are they doing their own work in individual assignments?\n- Is there an imbalance of effort in group projects?\n\nWhen you can clearly SEE student effort, then you can more effectively encourage and nurture it. \n\n\n\"I feel like I was in the dark about what my students were doing, and Classwork Zoom turned the light on.\" -English teacher\n\n\"Now it's so easy to see when there's an imbalance in group work. I honestly don't think I could get by without it anymore.\" -Physics teacher\n\n\"HOLY CRAP.\" -Chemistry teacher\n\n\nGoogle Classroom is a trademark of Google Inc.
