The only time I ever open this menu is to check someone else's calendar. I usually open the menu, start typing... and then mayhem unsues since a variety of random shortcut keys have been executed as I've been typing the persons name.\n\nIf this happens to you, this extension will fix that problem. Now, when the Main Menu is opened, the cursor will be placed directly into the \"Search for people\" text entry so you can start typing to find the person. A mayhem-free experience."
