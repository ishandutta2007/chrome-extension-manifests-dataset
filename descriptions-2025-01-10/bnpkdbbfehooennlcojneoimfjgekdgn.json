This is useful for stream sniping YouTubers and finding friends or players in-game who have joins turned off.\n\nThis extension will also give you the ability to download the texture (clothing template) for any Roblox shirt or pants.\n\nThis extension is available for all languages and automatically translates to the language that your Roblox account is set to.\n\nHow to find any Roblox player in-game using BloxFinder:\nStep 1. Go to any Roblox game and go to the \"Servers\" section of the game (The game you think your target is currently playing)\nStep 2. Click \"BloxFinder\" and type in the username of the person you want to search for\nStep 3. Click \"Find\" and wait patiently for it to locate the user\n\nInformation regarding finding any Roblox player in-game using BloxFinder:\n• This process works by detecting a match for the avatar of the desired user on the public server list of the game you searched for them on.\n• You will not be able to find your desired user if they are not shown in the first 5 players of the server they are in.\n\nInformation regarding exporting clothing textures using BloxFinder:\n• This currently only works for original shirts and pants, but in the future we will add the ability to export accessories and other textures.\n• The size of the image that gets exported may not be the correct size that Roblox requires for uploading clothing (585 x 559 pixels). You can resize it using an image resizer.\n\nIf this extension is helpful to you, we would highly appreciate it if you could give us positive feedback. Thank you for using BloxFinder!"
