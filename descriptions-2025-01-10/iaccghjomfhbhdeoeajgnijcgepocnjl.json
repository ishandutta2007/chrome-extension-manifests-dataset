If so, the sense of frustration at the cumbersome process of logging in to access a pay-walled resource may be all too familiar. \n\n1-Click lives in your browser toolbar and provides easy access to full versions of articles. Note that you need to have already have institutional access to the journals in question - 1-Click does not provide unauthorised access to pay-walled content. \n\nInstructions:\n1. [Required only upon installation] Click on toolbar icon and select your institution from the dropdown list. Click 'save'. \n\n2. Search for articles as you normally would. When presented with incomplete article and asked to log in for access, look out for the '1-Click' button.\n\n3. When presented with your institutional login page, fill in your credentials and proceed. And presto! You will be taken to the full article.\n\n\nIt works by prefixing the article URL with your institutional proxy URL, and if your institution has a valid subscription to the content, this takes you to the full version upon logging in.\n\nMinimal setup is required, and you can change your institution proxy at any time by clicking on the toolbar icon. The extension remembers your most recently saved proxy and runs in the background every time you fire up your browser!\n\n1-Click is perfect for you if you want a no-frills, stress-free experience while carrying our your research off-campus. Sometimes, cloud storage and markup tools aren't necessary - maybe like me, you already use other such services and don't want to disrupt your existing workflow - and all you need is quick access to the web page containing the full article.\n\nCurrent supported journals and databases are: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Ovid, Nature, Springer, UpToDate, BMJ Journals, Wiley, Taylor & Francis Online, SAGE Journals, IEEE Xplore, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, MIT Press, de Gruyter, ACS Publications.  \n\nFor a list of supported institutional proxies, please visit EZProxy DB (link below).\n\nDisclaimer: This extension does not store any passwords or collect user information. \n\nIf you have any suggestions or complaints, please email me at ian_tan@hotmail.com. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nProxy list taken from https://ezproxy-db.appspot.com/ by Tom Wambold.\n\n \nTap icon by Pixel perfect (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/pixel-perfect)\nDocument and wall icon by Freepik (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik)\n\nChangelog:\n\n25/8/18: Fixed Nature button"
