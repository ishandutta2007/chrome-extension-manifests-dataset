So it can be frustrating to find that these queries are not automatically saved or stored in any way by the default platform.\n\nThis is where our Chrome extension comes in. Every time an SQL query is run in Query Studio, the SFMC Query Saver extension automatically stores it. This feature allows developers to have a historical record of all the queries they have executed, enabling devs to revisit previous queries and save tons of time (by not needing to recreate old queries from scratch or combing through unsaved vscode tabs). Additionally, it helps with better tracking and debugging. \n\nGrab your SFMC Query Saver extension today and greatly enhance the functionality of Query Studio!"
