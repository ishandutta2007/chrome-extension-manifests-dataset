It shows you all the domains you have visited, sorted per domain. In a second table you see all the pages/urls (or deep links) for the selected domain. So if you for example select the Youtube-domain, it shows you all the videos you have seen. Smart Web History is available as Chrome and Edge extension.\n\nThe standard history function of chromium browsers saves all visits with 10 information fields per visit over a maximum period of 3 months. This app only saves the last visit with 4 information fields: the domain, title, url and date of the last visit. The resulting smaller database makes it possible to save urls over a much longer period of time (no limit). All the information is saved locally in the browser and can be exchanged with local data files (json-format).\n\nFeatures\n- Improved web browser history with the urls sorted per domain.\n- No restriction to the standard 3-month history, as visited domains/urls are saved in the browser.\n- Fast find your domain or url with the Quick Search tool.\n- Or find your url with the date picker.\n- Favicons for all domains (if available) for quick recognition.\n- Option to provide favorite domains (e.g. Wikipedia, Youtube) that will show up as icon in the toolbar.\n- Option to provide specific domains that will be hidden.\n- Export function: urls can be saved to a (json) file.\n- Import function: urls can be imported from a (json) file.\n- Keyboard support to navigate through the domains/pages or to select a url.\n- Free and open source software.\n- No ads, banners, popups or cookies."
