By clicking on the \"Smart Capture\" button, an overlay with a custom crosshair cursor appears, enabling users to draw a selection box. The captured area is then saved as a PNG file.\n\nInstant Snap: This feature captures the visible area of the webpage in an instant. By clicking on the \"Instant Snap\" button, the extension captures the current view of the tab and saves it as a PNG file.\n\nPanorama: This feature captures the entire webpage, including content outside the visible area. By clicking on the \"Panorama\" button, the extension scrolls through the page, stitches the captured sections together, and saves the full-page screenshot as a PNG file.\n\nThe extension ensures the cursor for drawing the custom area capture is visible on both dark and light surfaces by dynamically adjusting its color. This improves usability and accuracy, making it easier for users to select the desired capture area."
