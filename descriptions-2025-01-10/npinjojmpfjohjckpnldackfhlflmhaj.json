In Gitlab's free tier, the ability to specify multiple reviewers or approvers on a merge request is often a missing piece of the puzzle. However, many companies require this feature to ensure a thorough code review process. This extension empowers you to specify an unlimited number of reviewers for a merge request. With this enhancement, you'll have the flexibility to involve as many team members as needed, and all the designated reviewers will be prominently displayed on both the merge request and merge request list pages. This ensures that no code change goes unnoticed, fostering a collaborative and rigorous review process.\n\nüåü Custom review statuses. Elevate your code review process by reacting with custom review statuses. Now, you can go beyond the standard \"Approved\" labels. With our extension, you can \"Approve conditionally\" when a merge request doesn't necessitate further review after addressing feedback, or mark your status as \"Waiting\" if you plan to revisit the merge request later. These distinct statuses are prominently displayed on both the merge request and merge request list pages, providing clarity and transparency throughout the review cycle. By customizing your review statuses, you can tailor your code review process to meet the unique needs of your team.\n\nüåü Reminders about not submitted reviews. Ensure no merge request goes unnoticed with our review reminder feature. When you set your status to \"Wait\" or \"Approve conditionally\" and there's a pending review with unsaved comments, our extension alerts you to take action. This helps you stay on top of pending reviews, maintain accountability, and streamline the review process.\n\nüåü Review deadlines. Keep your code reviews on track by setting review deadlines. Our extension not only allows you to establish deadlines for merge requests but also provides a countdown, highlights approaching deadlines, and sends browser notifications to ensure that you and your team are aware of and meet important review timelines. This feature promotes efficiency and ensures that code changes move through the pipeline in a timely manner.\n\nüåü Automatic assignee changing. Streamline the review workflow by automating the assignment of reviewers. Our extension takes care of reassigning the merge request to the next reviewer once the previous reviewer has completed their assessment. This automation reduces manual intervention, minimizes bottlenecks, and optimizes the review process for faster code deployment.\n\nüåü Comment labels. Maintain consistency and clarity in your comments by adding labels like \"Optional\" or \"Praise.\" Our extension provides a uniform and visible way to categorize your comments, making it easier to distinguish between critical feedback and positive remarks. This feature enhances the communication within your team, ensuring that feedback is constructive and well-organized.\n\nüåü Marking threads as \"handled\". In situations where only the thread's author can resolve an issue, our extension allows you to mark a thread as \"handled\" without necessarily resolving it. This feature aligns with specific workflows and ensures that your code review process remains flexible and adaptable to your team's unique needs.\n\nMoreover, our extension is designed to seamlessly integrate into your Gitlab environment. Even if not everyone on your team uses the extension, it gracefully reverts to displaying basic information in comments and descriptions, ensuring a consistent and unobtrusive user experience.\n\n‚ùì How does it work?\n\nMost information is stored in comments and descriptions. For example, multiple reviewers are simply specified as a special string \"Reviewers: @username1 @username2\". Then the extension parses the information and displays it in a convenient format.\n\nüõ°Ô∏è The plugin does not store anything outside of your browser.\n\nEnhance your code review process, foster collaboration, and expedite your code deployments with the unparalleled capabilities of our Codecode Review for GitLab extension. Elevate your code reviews to new heights!\n\nPlease be aware that this Chrome extension is an independent project created by third-party developers and is not associated with GitLab .
