During all hours, the extension makes sure the user does not accidentally access malicious websites that are hardcoded in the badlist text file. During work hours, in addition to making sure the user does not accidentally access malicious websites, the extension makes sure the person stays focused on the internet by preventing them from accessing distracting social media and streaming websites. During the night, the user is not allowed to access and websites. Whenever the user attempts to access a malicious website, or a social media or streaming website during work hours, or the internet at night, the user is redirected to a custom html splash page that either notifies them that the website they attempted to access was malicious, distracting and that they should work, or that it is nighttime and they should sleep."
