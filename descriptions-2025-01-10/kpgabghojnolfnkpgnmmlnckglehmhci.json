Trying to do this objective, we are working together with the kick.com team in order to know when a new viewer follows a channel.\nUnfortunately, for the moment and due to problems of load, the website kick.com is only able to push those events on websocket using private channels, so we created an extension that is listening to the websocket events and is pushing the events to our backend.\n\nOn a technical point of view, the extension is very simple, just listening to the events that we are interested by on some specific pages and forwarding them using HTTP.\nWe tried to limit the pages and events we are listening to."
