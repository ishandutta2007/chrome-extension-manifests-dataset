Reload the extension and sign in with your account details to rock and roll.\n\n6. Still stuck? Drop us a line at contact@closetwitch.com and we’ll get you moving.\n\n \nFAQs: \n\nHow do you use the extension? \nFollow instructions for downloading and installing the ClosetWitch extension on our “Get Started” page. Then find demo videos here: closetwitch.com/demos\n\nSince our features are designed to have a very similar work flow (sorting, filtering, selections process) most users pick it up in just a few minutes.\n\nCan I use ClosetWitch on my mobile device?\nClosetWitch is currently a Google Chrome extension tool only, which means we exclusively work on desktop computers. But stay tuned for updates.\n\nDoes pricing go up or down with my closet size?\nNope! Sharing is free, Relisting/Offers/Price Adjustments, and more are features offered at a flat monthly rate for everyone, regardless of closet size. \n\nWhy are you so cheap? What’s the catch?\nWe’re small, but growing. Our pricing may grow too at some point, but for now we’re trying to stay competitive and win folks over with our outstanding customer service. Take advantage!\n\nWhich marketplaces does ClosetWitch support?\nClosetWitch is a tool for Poshmark only, at this time. But we’re working on cross-listing support for Ebay, coming very soon, so stay tuned.\n\nCan I use ClosetWitch outside of the United States?\nWe’re currently supporting the US, Canada, and Australia. Please reach out if you’re working from a different location and we’ll advise on whether we can support you: contact@closetwitch.com.\n\nIs Poshmark considered a bot?\nNo, ClosetWitch is not a bot. We are a witch.\n\nKidding! But still no: software is considered a “bot” if your machine is programmed to complete a repetitive action without the help of a human. Think auto-following other Poshmark users 24/7 whether or not you’re on your computer, or sending immediate offers to likers without your knowledge. \n\nClosetWitch’s bulk functions and poshmark automations are initiated by the user, who is fully in control of the process. You'll get the magic wand, but you'll still have to wave it.\n\nIs the ClosetWitch website and extension secure?\nYes. We take privacy and security very seriously. Check out our policy in the \"Privacy Practices\" tab.\n\nHow much does ClosetWitch cost?\nClosetWitch is a free tool for unlimited sharing. It charges a flat monthly fee for services like relisting, sending offers, adjusting prices, and more. See current pricing here: closetwitch.com/plans.\n\nWhat is the refund policy?\nWe want you to be thrilled with ClosetWitch. Cancel any time if the service isn’t working for you. ClosetWitch may be a tool, but the people who work here are humans, and happy to assist you. \nReach out at contact@closetwitch.com with any issues.\n\nWhat payment methods does ClosetWitch accept?\nClosetWitch accepts all major credit cards.\n\nAny questions not addressed here? Drop us a line at contact@closetwitch.com.\n\nAnd welcome to the coven!"
