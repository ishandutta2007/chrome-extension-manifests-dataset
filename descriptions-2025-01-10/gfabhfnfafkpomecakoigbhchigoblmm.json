This tool removes the stress of having to refresh the page constantly to get the order through.\n\nIf there are no delivery windows available for Amazon Prime Now, this tool will automatically refresh the page throughout the day to check for availability. It will also automatically complete the checkout process so that there is no need to manually click through the steps. This ensures that the order is executed as fast as possible to take advantage of the available window. It only works within the Amazon Prime Now checkout page, and no information is ever stored or retrieved from the user.\n\nIn order for this tool to work, the tab must remain open until the delivery window has been found and order placed. While the tool checks for availabilities, new tabs can be opened to navigate the internet as usual.\n\nPlease note that once a delivery window has been detected, this tool will proceed with the checkout process using the closest available window. Make sure you check the delivery address, tip amount, credit card, and any applicable fees for your order, since this tool will automatically place the order with your predefined options.\n\nHow to Use:\n\n1. Shop at the Amazon Whole Foods online store or via https://primenow.amazon.com\n2. Add items to your cart\n3. Proceed to checkout. If no windows are available, this tool will take it from there.\n\n* DISCLOSURE: Prime Shopper is not affiliated, or endorsed in any way by Amazon Inc.
