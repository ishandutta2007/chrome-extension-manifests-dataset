Furthermore, if you drag a card to the mirrored list it will be transferred to list that it is duplicating (and thus be shown as a copy in the mirror list).\n\nTo get started, create a list on a board with a title containing the list and board to mirror, following this syntax: \"[My list to duplicate@The board that list is on]\".\n\nObviously you need to be able to access both boards, and allow the plugin to act on your behalf as described in the OAuth dialog.\n\n1.13 Fixes problem with changed styles on Trello"
