If there was a Chrome Extension to define Latin words, I would have finished writing the Aeneid.\" - Virgil's last words\n\nFor millennia, Latin scholars have faced a ruinous obstacle: they've had to switch between two Chrome tabs to look up definitions. No longerâ€”Definitus aids you in translating Latin text. Pulling data from Whittaker's Words, Definitus can be used as a pop up window for on the fly definitions. Or, if the going gets tough, activate In-Depth Mode to extract the Latin from your webpage, enable hover-able translations, and define any word on command. Fortitudo facilis; scientia difficilis est.\n\nThis Extension is free and open-source. It costs us up to $10 a month to keep our OCR (text extraction from image) server running, so if you'd like to support the extension please feel free to Venmo a couple dollars to @Jamie-Gabbay-1 with the note \"Definitus.\" Thanks!"
