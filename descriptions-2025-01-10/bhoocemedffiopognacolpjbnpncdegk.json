Keybase launched an official extension please use that one.  Thank you for all of my users that took my little project and mean something for a couple of years.  I appreciate you all!\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nEasy KeyBase.io Encryption is a simple plugin that allows you to encrypt a string of text with someone's KeyBase.io public key.  The encryption system uses KeyBase's kbpgp.js library allowing for fast, accurate, and relatively safe encryption.\n\nThe application can then export the encrypted string to the clipboard or upload it to PasteBin for ease of use.\n\nYou can now also use a private key stored on KeyBase.io to sign messages both encrypted and plain text.\n\nThis application is free and open source.\n\nFor the full source:\nhttps://github.com/tehbmar/easy-keybase.io-encryption-extension\n\nSupport KeyBase.io and sign up today!\nhttps://keybase.io"
