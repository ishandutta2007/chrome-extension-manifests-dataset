It makes you aware of what websites you are spending a lot of time on in the browser.\n\nFocus lets you specify websites which you can group together by simply pressing a button. You can ungroup them whenever you like and can resume from wherever you left off.\n\nThese features were designed to be used together. You can specify websites that may be distracting you, and can choose to group them while you want to get other work done. \n\nBy not seeing the websites that distract you alongside the various other tabs you have open, you are less likely to get distracted by them and can work on whatever you have to do."
