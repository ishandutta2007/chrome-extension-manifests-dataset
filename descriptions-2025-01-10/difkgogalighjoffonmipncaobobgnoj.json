It currently supports 70+ languages and dialects, and uses HTML5's Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology.\n\nSimply highlight the text, right click it, and select the \"Speak\" option. With just two clicks, it's simple and quick to use! You can also press the extension icon and select \"Translate before Speech\" for it to translate the highlighted text into your preferred language before reading it. \n\nThis extension is perfect for language learners, especially people who can speak, but not read. We slow things down every other time so you can easily understand. Having trouble reading texts sent by family members in your traditional language? No problem, our team is entirely composed of second-generation immigrants; we know exactly how you feel, so we designed this with you in mind. Are you an international student getting used to a new environment? We've got you covered, the translation tool is perfect for you. Dyslexic? Well, we're here to make things easier for you. \n\nOptions:\nWe now support various dialects. Click on the extension, and go into the advanced settings where you can choose your preferred dialect. For example, if you're Cantonese speaker, in the drop-down menu, select Cantonese/Yue for the program to read Chinese characters in Cantonese instead of Mandarin. Here you can also change text speed, change the volume, manually change your native language, or slow down the speech every other time.\n\nCommands:\nCancel Speech: Alt+P (Command+P on Mac).\n\n===============\n\nHello! Text-to-Speech Highlighter is made by Tim, Bryan, and Sammy. We are computer science students from the University of Waterloo and McMaster University. Since we run our product at a loss, we will greatly appreciate any support we receive. Thank you for your generosity and support! :D\n\nAll donations will be spent on running this service: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ttshighlighter"
