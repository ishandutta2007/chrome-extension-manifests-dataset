I created this extension because I wanted two things:\n\n* A simple javascript toggle that I could trust not to send my data anywhere, and that does not request unnecessary permissions (i.e. it is not necessary to view the content of a website to prevent it from executing code).\n\n* An aesthetic that wasn't too ugly so I could tolerate the toggle button being visible in my browser menu.\n\nThere are similar extensions that are more robust, but I like code that strives to do only a single task without additional bells and whistles. No surprises here - just a simple, unobtrusive switch."
