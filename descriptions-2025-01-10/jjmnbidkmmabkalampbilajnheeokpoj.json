So many times, it happens that there's a long article that we're interested in, but we don't really feel like scouring through it to extract relevant information from it. \nTLDR This is a simple tool that can come in handy at that time by helping you spend less time reading counterproductive stuff and more on doing valuable work.\n\t\nSteps to get cracking - \nJust click the \"TL;DR\" button in Chrome's toolbar on a webpage which you'd like summarized and within a few seconds you'll get the <5 sentence summary right there."
