With Easy Skript, this problem is solved.\n\nEasy Skript replaces the default Minehut editor with a feature-rich editor built just for the Skript coding language.\n\nThe Easy Skript Editor has:\n    - auto code completion\n    - syntax highlighting\n    - automatic file saving\n    - 37 different editor themes to choose from (both light and dark)\n    - useful keyboard shortcuts like \"ctrl+s\" to save your file\n    - editor is resizable, and can enter fullscreen mode\n    - save and upload Skript files to and from your computer\n    - change font size with the click of a button\nAnd a LOT more!\n\nIn addition to the editor features, Easy Skript adds a button to the Minehut home screen to automatically navigate to your Skripts directory, so you don't have to click through the Minehut file manager every time you want to get to one of your Skripts. It also has a section with quick links to useful resources, like Skript documentation.\n\nEasy Skript is open sourced, so if you think it is malicious in any way, feel free to look through the code: https://github.com/IFStudios-dev/EasySkript\n\nIf you have any questions, have a suggestion for Easy Skript, want to stay updated, or want to talk about anything related to Easy Skript, join our Discord server! \nInvite link: https://discord.gg/vv4UkPcn2q"
