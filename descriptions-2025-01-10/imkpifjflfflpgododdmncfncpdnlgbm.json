Currently it supports translation from English\nto Japanese based on the Eijiro dictionary. Because it imports an Eijiro\ndictionary file into an IndexedDB inside Chrome, it works fast and also works\noffline.\n\n\nINSTALL\n\n1. Get an Eijiro dictionary file. You can either buy a book which comes with a\n   CD containing a dictionary file, or buy a file online at www.eijiro.jp\n\n2. Convert the dictionary file into utf-8. Type this command in your terminal:\n\n   $ iconv -c -f SJIS -t UTF-8 EIJI-118.TXT > EIJI-118-utf-8.TXT\n\n3. Import the dictionary file into Chrome.\n\n   3.1. Go to chrome://extensions in Chrome.\n   3.2. Click on the \"Options\" link on Chrodic. It takes you to the Chrodic\n        options page.\n   3.2. In the options page, click on \"Choose File\" button, select the\n        EIJI-118-utf-8.TXT file you just created.\n   3.3. Wait until \"Done!\" is shown on the textarea below.\n\n\nUSAGE\n\n After the installation you can enable Chrodic on any page by keep pressing the\nleft mouse button more than 500ms. Then Chrodic will start showing translation\nof words which are under your mouse. To disable Chrodic simply click on the\nleft mouse button.\n When you find a word you didn't know its meaning, you can save it for your\nlater study. To save, during you are seeing its translation in the translation\nbox, press the number key corresponding to the word. By default it saves the\nword and its translation into localStorage, which you can export to a TSV (tab\nseparated values) file. If you have an Ankiweb account, you can directly save\nit to your preferred anki deck, by doing appropriate settings in the options\npage. In order for that you need to be logged into Ankiweb in the same browser\nyou are using Chrodic."
