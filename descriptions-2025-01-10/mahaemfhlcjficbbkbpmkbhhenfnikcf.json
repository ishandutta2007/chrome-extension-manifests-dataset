(For both sides of the debate over the latter, see http://nyr.kr/1qTvSmd and http://buswk.co/1plFUv3.) Rather, Disrupt to Bullshit is offered for the entertainment of those who wish to install it in the privacy of their own browser, in the hope that they may be able to take full advantage of the comedic opportunities afforded to us all by the over-saturation of the word 'disrupt.' \n\nhttps://github.com/richardharrington/disrupt-to-bullshit"
