Choosing the right hands, in the right situations, and playing them correctly will simplify your preflop decisions and make your postflop better. \n\nGTO Preflop Ranges use an innovative system to minimize the number of ranges you need to learn and practice. It drastically reduces the number of ranges without sacrificing profitability.\n\nThree sets of ranges are available with the tool: \"Simplified\", \"Pure GTO\", and \"Custom\". Both the \"Simplified\" and \"Pure GTO\" range sets are based on solver calculations using the latest solver technologies available, which is why they are called GTO ranges. The custom range is your own, allowing you to edit and create personalized ranges.\n\nSimplified \nThis is the default mode and should also be your default most of the time. While based on GTO calculations, it follows a simplified tight-aggressive strategy. The simplified ranges have been designed by pro players and battle-tested by our team of grinders.\n\nPure GTO\nThese ranges come directly from the solvers with no alterations. They are intended for higher stakes, where more players are playing close to a GTO strategy.\n\nCustom (NEW)\nIn this mode, you have full control over the ranges and can modify and edit them to fine-tune your strategy.\n\nVersion 1.0.7 & 1.0.8 updates: Improved stability. \n\nVersion 1.0.6 updates: Added a new custom range mode where ranges can be edited and fine-tuned to the user's needs.\n\nVersion 1.0.5 updates: Added a quick tutorial.\n\nVersion 1.0.4 updates: Added the ability to take notes on ranges. Notes can be saved to a file and restored."
