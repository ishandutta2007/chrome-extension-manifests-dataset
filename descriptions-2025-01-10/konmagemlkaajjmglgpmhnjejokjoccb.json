Asana doesn't have a setting for this. When you have this extension installed and turned on, it will make sure that Asana tasks automatically load all the custom fields when the task is opened. No actions needed on your part. Just turn it on and get back into your work day.\n\nThis saves users at least a click every time they navigate to a new task, which can result in a lot of saved time and increased productivity by the end of a work day. With this extension, you don't have to waste any time searching for custom fields just to find that the info has been collapsed by Asana automatically. Always see your custom fields when you open a task."
