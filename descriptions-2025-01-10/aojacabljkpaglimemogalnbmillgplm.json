And poof it's gone. Even after reloading the page it won't reappear. Your attention, your focus, your choice. Happy erasing! \n\n**Limited permissions: Only requests permissions to pages you press the extension on**\n**Persists the erased elements so next time you visit the page they're still erased!**"
