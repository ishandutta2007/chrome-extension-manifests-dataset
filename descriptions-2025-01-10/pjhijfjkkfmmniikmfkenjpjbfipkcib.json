A lot of the shoes would be super expensive for someone like me, but enough pairs were within the amount of money I had leftover from my paycheck after bills and whatnot that I would just buy shoes on a whim.\nAfter buying more shoes than I need –– or even wear, still to this day –– I wanted to change how I looked at cost so that I stopped making impulse purchases \"just because I'm bored and I have enough cash\".\n\nTime As Money represents prices online as a measure of time with respect to an hourly wage.\nInstead of viewing a product in terms of \"can I afford this or not, at this moment, with the cash I have on me,\" Time As Money invites you to start justifying purchases by treating them as a byproduct of your labor:\n\n\"These shoes cost $50, and I make $10 an hour...I really don't think I'd work five hours for shoes that look like this, to be honest.\"\nOr,\n\"These shoes cost $50, and I make $10 an hour...I like them so much, I'd honestly work more than five hours for them. I'm glad they aren't as expensive as I thought they were.\"\n\nTo use this tool, enter your hourly salary (in dollars) and the length of your workday (in hours) into the extension's popup menu.
