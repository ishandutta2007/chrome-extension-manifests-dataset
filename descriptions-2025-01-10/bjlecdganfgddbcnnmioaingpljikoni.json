Circumventing Youtube's new adblock policies!\n\nFeatures:\n- Ctrl+Shift+Up to replace current video as a regular embed\n- Ctrl+Shift+Down to replace current video as a no-cookie embed\n\nFuture Features:\n- A utility window when clicking on the extension to edit settings and features easier\n- More shortcuts/tools to help navigate and browse Youtube easier (e.g. creating my own theatre mode, etc.)\n\nKnown Bugs/Issues:\n- Don't use it with playlists, replacing an adblocked video with an embed will still play through the playlist as if it were still blocked\n- You can watch a video as a no-cookie but you cannot fullscreen it as it lacks iframe support. You will most likely not be needing the no-cookie option anyways though, but I'll keep it for the sake of consistency\n\n*Some videos may not work with the regular embed, use no-cookie version instead\n*If the no-cookie embedded video is unavailable, refresh until it is\n*If it still doesn't work then oh well, this method is not full proof\n\nContact me at joshee.sullivan@gmail.com for any questions and concerns"
