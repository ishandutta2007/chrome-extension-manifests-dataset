This real-time transcription eliminates the need for manual note-taking, allowing clinicians to focus on patient care. The AI processes spoken words into structured clinical notes, providing a seamless copy-paste function into the appropriate EHR fields. The system supports both live transcriptions during sessions and post-session dictations, and all data is handled in a HIPAA-compliant manner, ensuring confidentiality and security.\n\nThis integration significantly reduces documentation time, accelerates insurance reimbursement processes, and supports clinician well-being by alleviating administrative burdens​​​​."
