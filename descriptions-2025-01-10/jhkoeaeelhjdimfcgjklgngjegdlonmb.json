Generally a good buying ratio is 1.5 times the players price, but its OK to pay more if you need to player or want to buy for profit selling.\n\n- Below the player's price you will find MAX selling price (2.5 times players worth) and profit (amount to gain if you buy at current price and sell at 2.5 times)\n\n- In your Squad page, when selling players, if the selling value is > 50,0M the player will be very difficult to sell, so you should try selling at 1.9 times its price instead of 2.5 times, colors will show you when the slider is in the correct position to have the player sold in a reasonable amount of time"
