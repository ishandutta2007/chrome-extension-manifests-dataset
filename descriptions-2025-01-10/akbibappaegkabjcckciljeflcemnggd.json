That is why I created \"Smart YouTube ADs Auto Skipper\".\n\nWith this extension, you can manage YouTube ADs in a smart way according to your preferences:\n\n- You can let the AUTO-SKIP take care of automatically skipping the AD that interrupted your viewing. But, remember: if an advertisement starts to look interesting to you, you can temporarily stop the autoskip and enjoy your advertisement just by pressing a convinient key on your keyboard... until you realize you are no longer interested and proceed to skip it, ALWAYS WITH THE SAME KEY ON YOUR KEYBOARD. INCREDIBLE! \n\nBut version 2.0.x brings some new features:\n\n- Do you often change your video playback speed? My extension gives you a very convenient shortcut to control your video playback speed: CTRL+UP/DOWN. This is not only useful for the videos you watch, but also for advertisements, allowing you to set a very boring non-skippable AD up to 16x speed.\n\n- If you are a true ADs hater you can ignore all of the above, this extension is for you. In this new 2.0.0 version you can set the extension to not allow any advertisement to bother you. Since you activate this setting, if an AD tries to approach you this will be instantly and brutally skipped.\n\nI also collect the number of the watched, skipped and insta-skipped advertisements. Just for fun."
