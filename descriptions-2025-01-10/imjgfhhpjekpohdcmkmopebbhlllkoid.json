We believe that letting you batch information by selecting your own interval is a better way of staying up to date. For the example above with the two friends, you would see one digest for each which enables you to allocate your time. This is by no means a perfect solution but it is a good step forward.\n\nCaveat:\nWe are using emails for the digests (for now) so you must be familiar with organizing and archiving emails. It's not as bad as you might think but if you have a super busy inbox, we would recommend creating a \"Ketchup\" label or a separate email account.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Supports Reddit, Twitter, and Hacker News (more on the way).\n- Delivers content straight to your inbox.\n- Customizable schedule.\n- Filters (e.g. Exclude retweets)\n\nhttps://ketchup.today/\nhttps://github.com/charleshan/ketchup-chrome-extension\n(This Chrome extension is only three lines long but it gets the job done!)"
