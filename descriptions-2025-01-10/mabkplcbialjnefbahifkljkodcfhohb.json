It works offline and runs in a sandboxed window. There is no internet activity whatsoever. You can assign a keyboard shortcut to open the game's interface and start playing with arrow keys. The extension replicates the original Pacman game in JavaScript.\n\nWhat is Pacman (Wikipedia):\nPac-Man[a] is a 1980 maze action video game developed and released by Namco for arcades. The original Japanese title of Puck Man was changed to Pac-Man for international releases as a preventative measure against defacement of the arcade machines by changing the P to an F. In North America, the game was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called \"Power Pellets\" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.\n\nHow to Play:\nUse arrow keys to move the Pacman in the maze. The objective is to eat all of the dots while avoiding four colored ghosts that pursue you. When you eat all of the dots, you will be advanced to the next level. If Pacman makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts has its own unique, distinct personality!\n\nMeet the Ghosts:\nBlinky (red)\nPinky (pink)\nInky (cyan)\nClyde (orange)"
