Choose a deep red shade to help you get in the zone.\n*Trying to get creative? It might be cliche, but studies have shown that shades of blue can help inspire you.\n\n   HOW TO USE:\n\t1. Enter Session Name\n\t2. Enter Session Time\n\t3. Choose Session Color\n\t4. Add Session to Session List\n\t5. Repeat Steps 1-4 as many times as you want\n\t6. Hit Start Button :-)\n\nUse CTRL+SPACE to bring up an overlay of the current task\n\ntint.timer@gmail // github.com/nwapw-tint/Timing-Extension"
