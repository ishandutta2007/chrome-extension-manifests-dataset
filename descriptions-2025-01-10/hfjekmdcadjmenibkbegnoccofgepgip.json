Whether you want to grab a quick glance  of the most popular discussed topics or explore emerging trends based off the comments from your favourite creators, this extension can help provide you with a quick overview, which is especially useful for videos that contain thousands of comment threads.\n\nYoutube Comments Insights also possesses a filter for the number of total comments you want to retrieve for a useful analysis which are given the percentage values of 50%, 75%, or 100%. Additionally to the most repeated words, the result from each analysis also identifies the most repeated bigrams, and trigrams which will provide a clear insight into the general themes being discussed within the comments section of the video you wanted to analyze. \n\nHave fun!"
