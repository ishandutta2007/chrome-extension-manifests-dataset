All features run locally on your computer, through a secured connection, so your information is never transferred to the mSecure Extension through an online source. The source of your information is the mSecure app itself.\n\n* For the initial release of mSecure 6, mSecure's Browser Extension will only be available for Mac. Windows support is coming soon.\n\n\nAUTO-FILL FOR ACCOUNT SIGN IN\nSigning in to an existing online account is incredibly simple, as mSecure can now provide the Browser Extension with the proper credentials automatically. Instead of switching to the mSecure app to copy and paste your username and password, those items are now injected into forms automatically.\n\nAUTO-CAPTURE FOR ACCOUNT SIGN IN\nWhen signing in to an online account that has not yet been saved to your mSecure app, the Browser Extension will take the username and password you entered and send it to mSecure so a Login can be created automatically. This simplifies online account systems as your Login data is saved as you browse the web.\n\nACCOUNT CREATION AND ACCOUNT UPDATES\nThe mSecure Extension goes beyond just help with signing in to your existing accounts. When signing up for a new account, choose from a list of the most popular usernames in your existing Login records. When choosing your username, mSecure also provides a randomly generated password for making sure your new account is safe and secure. \n\nThe process is similar for account updates. mSecure provides a randomly generated password so you don't have to worry if the password is strong enough. Simply accept the password mSecure generates, or tailor it to meet your needs in the password generator settings, and after the data is injected into the Sign Up or Update form, the new credentials are automatically saved in mSecure for easy access at a later time.\n\n\nExperience the security and simplicity only mSecure can provide. Simply download the mSecure app, create your account, and then download the Browser Extension here in the store. Your online account management will never be the same!"
