However it works just fine.\n\nThis extension simply saves bank login credential together with other Chrome settings.\n\nCredentials are saved ONLY in your browser, they are not send anywhere else.\n\nBefore using extension, please evaluate potential risks.\n\nNo more repetitive manual data entering. Saved credentials can be automatically filled in after bank page loads. Or it can be selected which credentials needs be filled in from extension window if there are multiple single bank logins.\n\nCurrently this extension works with SEB bank, Swedbank and Luminor in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia."
