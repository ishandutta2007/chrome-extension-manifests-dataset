Tools like slack help us keep up with deadlines and shifting priorities in remote work environments. \n\nBut those tools can also help us forget about who we're talking to and how they might be feeling. When we interact remotely, we often lose access to touch points that aid us in understanding other people's emotional state.\n\nIs your report gunning for a promotion? Is your team mate grieving the loss of a loved one? Is someone on your team just having a bad day?\n\nThis extension adds a few subtle UI elements that will help you keep empathy (and specifics) top of mind when messaging your team mates on slack."
