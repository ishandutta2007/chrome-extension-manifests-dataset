With Bullet Points, you no longer have to read long articles or news pieces. Instead, the extension will extract the three main points from the text and provide them in an easy-to-read format, allowing you to quickly gain an understanding of the overall content without having to read through it in its entirety.\n\nBullet Point uses a powerful GPT-3 artificial intelligence model to scan each page, extracting the most relevant information and condensing it into these three points. The result is a concise summary of what’s on the page that can be consumed quickly and easily. This makes it especially useful for busy professionals who need to stay up-to-date with their industry but don't have time to read every article they come across.\n\nIt also works great as a research tool for students who need quick summaries of articles or other texts for their studies. By using Bullet Points, they can get an overview of what's contained within each page without having to spend time reading through all of it. This can save them valuable time when doing research projects or studying for exams.\n\nUsing this extension couldn't be easier - just install it onto your browser browser and click the Bullet Points icon when you're on a page that you want to summarize. It will then do its magic, automating the summarization process so that you get three bullet points in seconds.\n\nYou can also summarize any linked page by right-clicking on the link and choosing the \"Summarize\" option. After reading the page summary you can decide whether you want to follow the link to read the full page. Finally, you can also select any amount of text on the page and let the extension summarize just the text you've selected.\n\nBullet Points can also be a great help for those who have trouble understanding long texts due to language barriers or reading difficulties. The extension simplifies complex information into an easy-to-understand format, allowing anyone to quickly understand what’s being presented on the page without having to read through it all themselves.\n\nIn addition to this, Bullet Points also makes it easier for people who are short on time but still want to stay up-to-date with their industry by providing them with quick summaries of articles or news pieces. By having longer texts condensed into three concise bullet points, they can gain an understanding of the content without having to read through it all in detail.\n\nOverall, Bullet Points is an excellent browser extension for anyone who wants a quick summary of any Web page. It’s very easy to use and requires no manual input, making it a great choice for busy professionals, students, or those with language barriers or reading difficulties. With just one click, Bullet Points will provide you with three concise bullet points that summarize the content of any page."
