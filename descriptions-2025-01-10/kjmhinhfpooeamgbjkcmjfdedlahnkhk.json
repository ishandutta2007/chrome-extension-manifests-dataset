It is commented and open-source, too. More most-like.\n\nIn early versions, only Korean was supported, but it is now possible to view as many languages as you want! In the options page, simply add more blocks, for example `.most-de { bottom: -100px; height: 100px; }` for German subtitles just below the player.\n\nVisit https://github.com/JoelSjogren/most to fork, contribute, report bugs and request features!"
