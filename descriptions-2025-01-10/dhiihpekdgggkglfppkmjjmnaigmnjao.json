There are many extensions like the bit.ly extension to create a short URL with just one click and copy it to the clipboard. Then click this extension to show the clipboard. Automatically removes http/s prefix from URLs in order to save space since Chrome extension popups are limited to 800x600 pixels (and using the full screen would require the extension for more permissions).\n\nSpecial thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/users/1793477/sudarshan for his thorough example code on using the clipboard in Chrome extensions as well as communicating between the popup and background windows.

Good stuff!"
