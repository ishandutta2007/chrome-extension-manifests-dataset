And on groups and explore, flickr does some strange stuff that can delay the extension's activation. \n\nWhen learning photography you need to see the settings used to take the shot. Instead of laboriously clicking through to a photo's Exif data, with this extension you can just float the mouse above a photo and the info will reveal itself a moment or two later.\n\nAlso includes Lens and camera info, and gives the 35mm (fullframe) equivalent focal length in brackets if the exif supplies it."
