Ctrl+Shift+T will still work. You should install this if you're used to Ctrl+Z to reopen closed tabs and/or you don't like stretching your fingers to type Ctrl+Shit+T. Although, honestly, I don't care if you use this or not.\n\nKnown bugs: When you start Chrome after it has been completely closed, pressing Ctrl+Z won't reopen closed tabs from the last time Chrome was running, but Ctrl+Shift+T will.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I want it to use a different keyboard shortcut!!\nA: That's great. Do it yourself.\n\nQ: I found a bug, please fix it!!\nA: No. Fix it yourself.\n\nQ: I want feature X!!\nA: Too bad. Add it yourself."
