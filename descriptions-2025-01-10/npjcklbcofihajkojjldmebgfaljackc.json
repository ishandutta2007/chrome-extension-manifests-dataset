Think it is as an enhanced hosts file right under your browser toolbar.\n\nUsage:\n\nThe extension comes with two features, \"redirections\" and \"matches\". \n\n- Redirections are simple URL rewrites. If you add \"localhost:3000/my-local-script.js example.com/my-live-script.js\" line to the redirections then \"https://example.com/my-live-script.js\" will be rewritten as \"https://localhost:3000/my-local-script.js\". With the same logic, you may redirect a complete remote folder to a local one.\n- Matches are different. They are plain request blockers. Provide a URL match like \"cdn.example.com/assets/img\" and all image request to those assets folder will be blocked.\n- Syntax for redirections is \"localhost:3000/my-local-script.js example.com/my-live-script.js\". Two space separated strings separated with any number of spaces.\n- Syntax for mathces is \"cdn.example.com/assets/img\". A single string to match image URLs.\n- Comments are welcome with lines starting with # symbol.\n\nWhat you can't do:\n\n- You can't edit HTTP headers\n- No regex support\n- You can't top Content-Security-Policy response headers\n\nWarning:\n\n- This is a developer tool for experienced users. Redirections may result in catastrophes. So if you're not an experienced user, please consider not using this extension or get some help from someone.\n- Avoid generic matchers like \"my-local\" \"example.com\". This extension is developed to debug a remote script with a local development environment. Nothing more than that. Generic matchers may also result \"too many redirections\" errors to be thrown by browsers.\n- This tool is not an ad blocker."
