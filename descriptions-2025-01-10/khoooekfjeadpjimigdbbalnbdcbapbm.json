Click on 'Login' to log in to VOLSBB.\n  \nTo change your username/password, simply type it again in the popup and click 'Save'.\n\nThe extension will automatically try to log you when you start up chrome or when the pronto authentication page is open. This normal behavior! Just sit back, relax and let the app do the work for you.\n\nThis app has been tested to work in VIT Vellore, but can theoretically work with any Pronto Authentication System.\n\nTo see the source code and for more info, visit - https://github.com/cybergla/pronto-auto-login.\n\nThis extension does NOT record your usernames or passwords. All your data is stored securely with your Google account.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This product is still in beta and you may notice some bugs.
