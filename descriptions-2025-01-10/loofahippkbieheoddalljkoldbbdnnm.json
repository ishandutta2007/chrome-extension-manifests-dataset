So added players \"bindings\" to solve that issue\nWhole information is saved in google sheets: Cryplect and LKL players names binding\n\n2. Added about information\n\n\nInitial version(v0.1) released: 2022-11-21\n\nAdded:\n1. Filtering by scarcity\n2. Filtering by teams which are playing on selected day\n3. Sorting by team city, scarcity, player's position or player's name\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: there is no 100% guarantee that extension works as it should (because Cryplect website is updating frequently) and human factory.\nAnyway, this tool was made to help users. So please enjoy it and use it for free."
