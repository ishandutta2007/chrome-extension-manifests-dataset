It allows users to convert long Twitter threads or series of tweets into a single article. Many people know it as a thread reader app.\n\nKeeping up with long threads or series of tweets can be very difficult and extremely frustrating. To help our Twitter users, we have developed an easy-to-use tool.\n\nUnrollNow v2:\nUnrollNow v2 comes with more features. You can now directly unroll any thread from the \"Home\" and \"Search\" pages. A small icon appears below every post on Twitter. Simply click the unroll icon on any tweet.\n\nFor v1 and v2 users:\nGo to any parent tweet of a thread on X (formerly Twitter). Click on the UnrollNow extension, and then click the \"Unroll This Thread\" button. Your longer threads will now be converted into easy-to-follow articles."
