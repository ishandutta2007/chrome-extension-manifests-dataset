Frustratingly, Gmail still lacks this feature. Hundreds of hours are wasted every day (citation needed) by people having to undo their paste, stare at the icons trying to distinguish the chain link from the paper clip, and then use the dialog just to add a link. The horror!\n\nThis simple Chrome extension fixes that! It detects when you are pasting a URL over existing text, and does the expected thing.
