Tired of reading through chains of ad-hominem attacks? HealthyTweeps hides hateful content on Twitter so you don't have to engage with it.\n\nTweets are confidentially analyzed using ModerateHatespeech's high-performing machine learning API, and content flagged as inflammatory, hateful, and threats that don't add any value are automatically hidden.\n\nA warning will be displayed whenever any content has been filtered, and hovering over the warning will show the filtered tweet.\n\nOur Chrome extension is completely free to install and any data sent to our API is completely anonymized and never logged. Our work on mitigating bias ensure that content is hidden because its clearly toxic and unconstructive, without censoring certain opinions, ideologies, or identitues. This extension does not hide aggressive, dissenting, or rude tweetsâ€”only that truly detract from a healthy Twitter experience."
