Would it increase the chances of you replying to the messages?\n\nPersonalized Media causes a ‘Pattern interrupt’ is an extremely effective technique in sales that pushes recipients to not rely on their generic responses. Which is why we’ve observed that such communication gets a minimum of 300% better reply rates as compared to standard messages. Interesting isn’t it? \n\nYou can now serve hyper-personalized images & video links through Gmail or LinkedIn with the help of Nexweave’s Outreach Plugin and boost your reply rates & engagement.  \n\nHere is how you can put Nexweave to use for your Sales Outreach using Gmail\n\nSTEP 1 - Set up an Image Template\nCreate an image with placeholders for your prospect’s name, logo and company screenshot, if you want every recipient to see their name and company logo to be shown on the image. If you have other ideas, feel free to add your own personalization variables.\n\nStep 2 - Set up a Video Template\nUse the same personalization variables in the video to have coherence in the customer journey. When they feel like you’ve taken the effort to make something just for them, they will most likely want to respond to your video message. To make it easier for them to do so, keep the videos short and include a Call-To-Action in the video which will help then either ‘Book a Call’ or ‘Start a Trial’\n\nStep 3 - Create a Campaign\nWith Campaigns, you can have 3 flows - \nServe personalized images in emails \nServe clickable personalized images that redirect your prospects to a personalized video on your landing page. \n\nIf you’re using LinkedIn, you can use the same method to include either images or video links with personalized images as previews. \n\nSo go ahead and try them out. if you need assistance, send us an email on connect@nexweave.com or message us through the chat option on our website https://www.nexweave.com/"
