No need to look for the search bar, this does it by itself, making your life easier!\n\nHas it ever happened to you that you were browsing a website such as Facebook, Wikipedia, Youtube, or just any website with a search bar, and while scrolling around you saw something that you want to search in the same website you're surfing. But some websites have a small search bar that takes you too long to find, some websites only have a logo for it, other websites hide it in strange place..\nOr maybe you scrolled too far down and you're too lazy to scroll back up to search, and it may perhaps be because you're too lazy to use your keyboard to copy paste or type.. \n\nThis extension is your solution.. Very simple, anyone can do it!\n\nJust highlight any text, right click and click the new \"Search in site\" option on the menu. and voila, it will automatically copy paste and click enter for you!"
