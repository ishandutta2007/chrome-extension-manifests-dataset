Cross-chain and browser extension capabilities make it possible to hold and transact $DAG and supported ETH/ERC-20 tokens such as $LTX, $ADS, $DODI, and $JAM.\n\nThe Stargazer Wallet was created by Stardust Collective, a decentralized open source organization with members from all around the world, including Amsterdam, Dubai, San Francisco, Singapore and Sydney. The Stardust Collective’s work focuses on producing companion dApps and tools built on Constellation’s Hypergraph network.\n\nFeatures\n\nCross-chain compatibility with Ethereum Network:\nStore, transact, and interact with supported ETH/ERC-20 tokens. This is the first step to making the Stargazer wallet cross-chain compatible within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nSeed phrase ready: \nYour multi-chain wallet comes with a 12-word seed phrase for added security—you own and control your assets and transactions at all times, including your seed phrase. Please remember to back up your seed phrase in a secure place. If you lose the seed phrase, you will lose access to your wallet/tokens permanently.\n\nMultiple addresses, one wallet: \nYou can create multiple addresses each with their own unique public/private key pairs within your wallets. This serves as an enhanced security feature when a user wants to diversify their holdings amongst several addresses within the same wallet for privacy reasons.\n\nSend and receive tokens: \nYou can send/receive $DAG and supported ETH/ERC-20 tokens to/from an exchange or your existing wallet address. You can also send $DAG between different addresses within your Stargazer wallet.\n\nHardware wallet support:\nConnect your Bitfi hardware wallet with Stargazer to interact with Web3 applications in the most secure context possible.\n\nContacts: \nDo you send tokens to frequently used addresses? You can manage your addresses easily.\n\nImport single private key account: \nIf you have a wallet with multiple addresses, easily import an individual address via your private key, rather than importing all the existing addresses linked to your wallet.\n\nSupport for NFTs:\nStore all your NFTs including your Dor Traffic Miner NFTs in your Stargazer Wallet. You’re now able to see how many NFTs you hold, and can link out directly to platforms such as OpenSea to view your NFTs."
