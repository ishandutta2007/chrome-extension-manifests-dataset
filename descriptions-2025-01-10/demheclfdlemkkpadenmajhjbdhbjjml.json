Once you open the add-on for the first time, you will see a sidebar at the left and an empty text editor at the right. The left sidebar includes file I/O buttons. For example, a button to open file(s) or settings. There is also a right sidebar that includes all the options for this app.\n\nNote 1: This extension uses the new file system access API (https://web.dev/file-system-access/) to open and save files to disk. But, if your browser does not support this new API, it uses the - downloads - API instead to save files to disk in the default download folder (asks for downloads permission when opening the interface).\n\nNote 2: Currently, Text Editor supports three key-maps for famous text editors (i.e. sublime). Moreover, it supports more than 100 coding languages (i.e. JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc.)\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form in the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/text-editor.html)."
