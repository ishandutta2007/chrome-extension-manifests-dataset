You can even get street level accuracy by specifying GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).\n\nCustomize your search even further by changing the domain, language and device.\n\nWhy is this extension needed?\n\nGoogle search results vary depending on where the searcher is located. For local businesses and brands that have stores in many different locations, being able to see what the searchers see in all these places is very important.\n\nWhat do searchers in Paris see when they search for your brand? How about in Times Square, New York? What if they search in another language or on a mobile device?\n\nNow you can search just like a local walking on the street with a phone that has GPS enabled.\n\nYou do not need a VPN or a proxy server to see Google search results from any location worldwide. All you need to do is enter the location you want to search from, the language and the device, and let AWR Search Anywhere do the rest.\n\nNote: When this extension is enabled and a search location is selected, all your searches in Google will be performed from that location. If you wish to search from your default location (based on your IP address), just click on the extension icon and use the switch at the top to make AWR Search Anywhere inactive."
