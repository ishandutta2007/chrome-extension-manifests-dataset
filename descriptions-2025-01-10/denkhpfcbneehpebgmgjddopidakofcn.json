It is hard to believe, but GitHub and GitLab do not support this natively.\n\nThis extension automates a neat, Git-based workaround. It creates a single pull / merge request out of the entire repo so that comments can be placed on any line. This is useful for code audits, planning for a refactoring, or giving someone comprehensive feedback on a project.\n\nSupport for GitLab is coming soon!\n\nHow to Use:\n1. Navigate to the repo you want to be reviewed\n2. Open the extension and follow the steps\n3. Once the extension is done, you will have a new branch in your repo with one pull / merge request that will contain the entire repo. Other people can comment on and discuss any line in the repo.\n\nBuilt by the team at Antcode, a platform where developers help other developers through open code reviews."
