Were you thinking about flying to another airport just to get your interview completed? Let Global Entry Drops help you!\n\nMany people book an interview but later drop it. This means you can schedule that appointment time when it becomes available! \n\nThis little nifty extension allows you to find the earliest interviews available at any location you choose. After you select the location, start and end date and hit \"save and start\", the app runs in the background to find the earliest interview date available.\n\nFAQ:\nQ: Does Chrome need to be running for this app to work?\nA: Yes, Chrome needs to be running. If you exit or force close Chrome, the app will not run and you won't see any notifications.\n\nQ: Does this work on mobile devices?\nA: It is not supported on Chrome mobile browsers that don't support extensions.\n\nQ: Can I search multiple locations?\nA: That is not a supported feature currently.\n\nQ: Why can I not see notifications?\nA: If you have a Mac device, confirm that you have notifications enabled for your browser. In later Mac OS versions, the notification appear as part of the Mac OS notification group."
