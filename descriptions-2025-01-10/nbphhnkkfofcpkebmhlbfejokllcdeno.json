Using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, MedSet integrates seamlessly with electronic health record (EHR) systems, such as PointClickCare, to analyze patient data from multiple sources and identify conditions that require immediate attention or additional care.\n\nOur Chrome extension serves as the bridge between MedSet's advanced analytics and the healthcare workers who rely on actionable insights during their day-to-day operations. This tool embeds directly into the EHR system interface, presenting a comprehensive dashboard that highlights patient-specific recommendations in a clear, user-friendly manner.\n\nKey Features and Functionality:\n\nReal-Time Data Integration:\nThe extension connects to the facility's EHR system, pulling patient data such as vital signs, diagnoses, care plans, and documentation entries. This ensures that all recommendations are based on the most up-to-date clinical information.\n\nActionable Recommendations:\nMedSet analyzes patient data to identify all reimbursable conditions under Medicare guidelines. It issues clear, actionable recommendations that caregivers can use to enhance patient care and improve regulatory compliance. Examples include identifying conditions like sepsis or dependence on dialysis that require specific documentation, care plans, and follow-ups.\n\nSpecialized Dashboards for Caregivers:\nThe extension categorizes information into intuitive tabs, such as Nursing, SLP (Speech-Language Pathology), and GG Data. These sections are tailored to different caregiver roles, ensuring each professional sees the insights most relevant to their responsibilities.\n\nStreamlined Compliance Reporting:\nTo ensure facilities meet Medicare's strict regulatory standards, the dashboard highlights required documentation, how to demonstrate conditions as active, and any physician or care team involvement needed.\n\nImproved Care Planning:\nBeyond compliance, MedSet’s insights help facilities provide better care. For example, by identifying risk factors like cognitive decline or functional impairments, the extension suggests interventions that can enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.\n\nWho Benefits from the MedSet Chrome Extension?\n\nPrimary Caregivers: Nurses and aides can quickly access care recommendations tailored to their patients' current conditions.\nMDS Coordinators: Gain actionable insights to ensure all conditions are accurately documented in the Minimum Data Set (MDS), maximizing Medicare reimbursements.\nAdministrators: Maintain compliance and optimize resource allocation with detailed reporting and actionable alerts.\nWhy MedSet?\nTraditionally, the process of identifying reimbursable conditions and ensuring proper documentation has been manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error. MedSet automates this process with unparalleled precision, saving facilities time and ensuring no potential revenue is overlooked.\n\nThe Chrome extension amplifies MedSet’s capabilities, integrating AI-powered insights directly into caregivers’ workflows, reducing errors, and enhancing care quality. By simplifying the complex, MedSet allows caregivers to focus on what matters most: the well-being of their patients."
