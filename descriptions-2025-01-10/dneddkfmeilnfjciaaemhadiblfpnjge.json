Designed to enrich and enhance Bard's artificial intelligence capabilities, this extension works by integrating the powerful and highly advanced ChatGPT APIs into your Bard platform.\n\nWhen you interact with Bard, Super AI steps in to improve the quality of responses. Here's how it works: Whenever you ask Bard a question, Super AI directs that query to the ChatGPT API first. It then fetches the response from ChatGPT and presents it to Bard. Inspired by the response from ChatGPT, Bard refines its own answer, resulting in a more informative, precise, and contextually accurate response.\n\nWith Super AI, you'll experience a noticeable upgrade in Bard's response quality, bringing your interaction to an entirely new level. This extension makes Bard smarter and more conversational, providing you with the insights and clarity you need.\n\nWhether you're a long-time Bard user looking to upgrade your AI experience or a new user aiming to make the most out of this platform, Super AI is a game-changer. Experience an enhanced Bard today by adding the Super AI extension to your Google Chrome.\n\nNote: \"Super AI\" does not store or share any of your queries or responses. It only acts as a bridge between Bard and ChatGPT to enhance your Bard experience. Your privacy is our priority.\n\nGet ready to embark on a seamless journey with Bard and Super AI, where artificial intelligence meets real-world intelligence.\n\n#####Check This video to learn how to install and use \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdKd4K2Y5d0\n\nStep 1: Installation\n\nGo to the Chrome Web Store and search for your extension by name (or provide a direct link to your extension).\nClick on the \"Add to Chrome\" button to install the extension.\nConfirm the installation in the pop-up dialog.\nStep 2: Configuration\n\nAfter installation, you'll see the extension icon added to the Chrome toolbar.\n\nClick on the extension icon to open the popup page.\n\nOn the popup page, you'll find two input fields for configuration: \"API Secret Key\" and \"Model.\"\n\nTo get the \"API Secret Key\":\na.
