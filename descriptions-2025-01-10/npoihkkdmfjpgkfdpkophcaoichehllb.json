This feature could be useful for testing the same request with different parameters, or for checking whether a previously problematic request has been fixed.\n\nSave requests for future testing: Save HTTP requests for future testing or reference. This could be useful for tracking changes over time, or for sharing requests with other team members.\n\nCreate collections: Coming soon.\n\nThis tool can be useful for anyone involved in testing and debugging HTTP requests. Specifically, it can be helpful for software developers, quality assurance engineers, system administrators, and anyone else involved in web development.\n\nSoftware developers can use this tool to test their APIs and web services during development and debug issues in their code. Quality assurance engineers can use it to automate and manage their testing processes, ensuring that requests are being tested thoroughly and efficiently. System administrators can use it to monitor and troubleshoot their web applications and APIs.\n\nIn addition to these roles, this tool can also be helpful for technical writers who need to document APIs and web services, as well as for product managers who need to understand the behavior of the applications and services they are responsible for.\n\nOverall, this tool is suitable for anyone who needs to test and debug HTTP requests, regardless of their specific role in the development or management of web applications and services."
