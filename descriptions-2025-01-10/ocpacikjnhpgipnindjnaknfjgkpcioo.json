Controls can be checked at the top right with a new button.\n- popup window for the extension contains option toggles to choose which options to enable\n\n- previous-games page\n        1) fixed scrolling text for guessed games - current implementation caused lag and broke some of the layout\n        2) you can hover over squares to see a pop-up with your guess\n\nExtension does not seem to bring any performance issues to the website judging by lighthouse audits - the most heavy feature is the search bar: at worst it adds about  70-90ms delay to search results(when there are around 800 of them)."
