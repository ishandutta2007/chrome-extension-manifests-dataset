With our free site blocker extension, we have you covered. To ensure that websites won't distract you, simply add them to your block list. If you attempt to visit a website that is on your block list while it is blocked, we'll even throw in some hilarious memes and images. \n\nBe more concentrated\nOver 5 million individuals use the program and website blocker Blocksite globally. You can use BlockSite to temporarily block distracting websites and apps to improve your focus, productivity, and self-control. \n\nFeatures \n\nTarget Mode\n\nUtilizing the Pomodoro approach, focus mode enables you to manage your schedule. Divide your duties into 25-minute periods, with a 5-minute break in between. You can configure specified times to restrict websites and times to surf freely with \"Focus Mode.\" \n\nAdult Material\n\nEver wished you could filter adult content? The Network Privacy Defence addon makes this simple to do. By default, our adult blocker filters out all pornographic websites to ensure that you never see any offensive or undesired information.\n\nPlanned mode\n\nMake up your own daily timetable and routine if you feel like you need a little additional push to keep on track. You can schedule specific days and times when you can visit particular or previously prohibited websites using the \"Scheduling\" tool. \n\nIndividualized Block Page \n\nGet imaginative now, please! By selecting your own images and text to display while visiting a banned page, you may now design your own blocked pages. \n\nRemove Prevention \n\nNobody can delete the program from your devices without your knowledge or permission thanks to the uninstall prevention feature.\n\nRedirect to Site (Premium Feature)\n\nWhen you attempt to access a prohibited app or website, you will be transferred to an alternative website so you may resume your attention (for instance, if you block YouTube and attempt to access it, you can opt to be redirected to your email).\n\nSync\n\nYou can disable anything on your computer or phone on your mobile device as well. To stay focused wherever you are, you may sync prohibited websites, keywords, and password protection.\n\nInsights\n\nOn BlockSite, examine your web browsing trends! With our insights function, you can now see how much time you spend online and on which websites. Additionally, you may see how much time you've saved, which website categories you visit the most, and other information."
