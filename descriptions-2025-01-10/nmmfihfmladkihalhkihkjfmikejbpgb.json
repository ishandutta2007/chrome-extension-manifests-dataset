It offers convenient features to help you efficiently manage your chat history and quickly navigate between existing conversations.\n\nPrivacy Assurance:\nThe extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. It only interacts directly with the official ChatGPT service and does not connect to any third-party endpoints or services.\n\n=========================================================================\n\nVersion 0.3.0\n\nHey everyone! Here’s an update on the latest improvements to ChatGPT Plus Plus.\n\n- Windows users: Sorry for the confusion! I don’t have a Windows machine, so I didn’t know it didn’t work before. We’ve switched to using Ctrl + P instead of the old Windows key + P combo.\n- New Actions: We’ve added some quick actions to help you switch between different models and access the conversation cleanup tool. If you can get these features, you can now control them using the panel.\n- Tooltips and Quick Search: We’ve also added tooltips for the cleanup and quick search action buttons. And here’s the exciting part: we’ve integrated ChatGPT search, so search results will now appear in the quick search. If you can access this feature, you can now search with ChatGPT.\n\nWe hope you’re having a blast with these new features!"
