Since I want to spare that research i already did in the past, I try to find the upvoted answers made by my user (to get an acknowledge by myself).\n\n\nScrolling down?\n----------------\n\nWhat bothers me in this process is the fact that answers aren't always at the top and i have to scroll down to the bottom to see them.\n\nThat's sucks. Therefore I made this chrome extension that re-sorts the answers by your votes. For instance, if you upvoted an answer and revisited that question later, it will appear first in the answers list\n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nI suggested this feature on Meta StackExchange. However, upon this day I still waited and it seems this might not got the attention of their Product Manager.\n\nSince I see StackOverflow as an important tool in my daily routine, I implemented this chrome extension as a weekend project mainly to help myself and other developers be more productive :+1:."
