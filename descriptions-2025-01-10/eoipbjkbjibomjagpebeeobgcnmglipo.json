Compatible with all browser-based tools to allow for quick highlight & capture.\n\nHow it works - Highlight the feedback you want to capture and click the UserVitals chrome extension icon. UserVitals should be able to detect which customer this feedback is coming from for supported apps such as Intercom, Helpscout, Zendesk, Gmail, and more in just one click. \n\nCapture insights from customer conversations in a few clicks, from any web-based tool your team is already using. Sales, support, and success teams have frontline access to customer feedback that they often find difficult to process, route, and deliver to the product team. Valuable customer insight often slips through the cracks. UserVitals provides internal customer-facing teams with a simple, non-disruptive mechanism to deliver customer insights directly to the product team. \n\nUserVitals can be used as an internal tool feedback management tool, but still allow customers to interact with their history of feedback, or it can be used publicly by publishing a product roadmap and changelog. \n\nNever lose sight of common feature requests, ideas, and pain points that come through customer channels. Easily see what matters to your customers and why, with all context at hand, and inform your product decisions."
