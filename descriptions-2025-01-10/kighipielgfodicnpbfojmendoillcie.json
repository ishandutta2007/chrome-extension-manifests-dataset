It helps you remove all the tracking data sites like Amazon typically append to your product search. It also lets you open a selected cleaned up link in either the current window or in a new one.\n\nA typical example is when you end up with:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Mathematica-Cookbook-Building-Science-Engineering/dp/0596520999/ref=mp_s_a_1_17?ie=UTF8&qid=1540661026&sr=8-17&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=mathematica&dpPl=1&dpID=51VOw%2BIWKRL&ref=plSrch\n\nWhen all you want is:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Mathematica-Cookbook-Building-Science-Engineering/dp/0596520999\n\nThis extensions needs the \"tabs\" permission, which Chrome describes as \"can read and change all your data on websites you visit.\" That description is very scary, and is certainly not what this extension is doing. Being an open-sourced project, you can always read all the code to see how this extension works, and what it's [not] doing with your data."
