The Pin Buster has been updated accordingly.\n\nv1.4.3 - Pinterest again changed their DOM structure in an attempt to negate extensions like this. Pin Buster has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nv.1.4.2 - Pinterest changed their DOM structure again. Pin Buster has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nv.1.4.1 - Altered new pin busting implementation since the one from 1.4.0 had unwanted side effects (sorry about that!).\n\nv.1.4.0 - Pinterest tried to outsmart us by getting sneaky with a new DOM structure specifically designed to negate extensions like this. But a workaround has been implemented that should bring back full functionality. \n\nv1.3.2 - Improved video busting implementation per user feedback. Updated to Manifest V3.\n\nv1.3.1 - Bugfixes to new pin busting implementation.\n\nv1.3.0 - Changes to accommodate new DOM structure on Pinterest that broke the old pin busting implementation."
