(e.g. \"arnazon.com\" is a fake domain of \"amazon.com\")\nWe need something to tell us if a domain is safe.\n\nAfter installing this extension, the options page will be opened.\nOn that page, you can register domains that you think them safe.\nAfter that, when you access to a site in your white list, the icon with green badge (labeled \"OK\") is shown in top-right of Chrome browser, otherwise only the icon without green badge is shown."
