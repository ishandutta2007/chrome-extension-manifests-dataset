This simple extension aims to eradicate this daily annoyance by automatically logging you back into Moodle through Raven.\n\nTo see a guide on how to use it, and also how your data is used, please go and read the README at https://github.com/LakeeSiv/cam-moodle-auto-login#readme \nIf you can't be asked to do that, then I'll put the TLDR here.\n\nYour data is encoded (unlike other extensions like AutoFill) and is stored *locally* on your hard drive, it is never sent to any external places!! You have the option to wipe any data that is collected by this extension by pressing the \"Removed Stored Data\" button.\n\nAlternatively you can use your own password manager to autofill and we will have getting to the login page and clicking the login buttons."
