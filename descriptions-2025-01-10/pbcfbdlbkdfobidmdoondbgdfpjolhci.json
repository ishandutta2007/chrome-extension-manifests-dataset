Now the image is being processed and downloaded based on your preferences. Conversion to JPG, PNG and WebP are supported.\n\nThese preferences can be set in the option menu that you can reach by clicking on the extensionsâ€™ browser button located on the top right of your browser next to the address bar.\n \nNote that the \"browser button\" may be hidden. If you want to quickly change the settings pin it to your extension bar. This can be done by clicking on the \"extension\" (looks like a puzzle piece) next to the hamburger menu / user login. Find the button and click on \"pin\".\n\nWhat can you configure?\n\n* Image conversion types\nFor each image type you can select if and to what image type it is supposed to be converted to. (JPG, PNG or WebP).\n\n* Download location\nTo keep downloads sorted you can specify your preferred download location and filename. The Download location and filenames can include information of the time and date of downloading, image origin and image format. The exact details can be found in the extension.\nNote that download locations are always relative to your download folder. \n\n* Actions (Advanced section)\nYou can change the default autodetect behavior into a fixed task without changing your autodetect settings. This can be useful when you temporarily only want to download images without converting them yet but still want to store them on the specified location. Or if you only want to download PNG files for example.\n\n* Popup layout (Advanced section)\n For quick access specify which tab you want to open by default. \n\n* Generic (Advanced section)\nTo optimize your workflow you can turn off the popup that suggests  download location and filename.\n\nFaq\n\n   * The image that was downloaded and converted did not converted to the intended filetype.\n    Webp /Avif image converter uses the actual file data to determine the file type not the url.\n\n    Therefor, you may experience that a conversion may be different than what you may expect if you look at the url.\n    Also file extensions are corrected to the appropriate extension in these cases if you turned off conversion for the specific file type.\n\n  * The extension does not converts the image but gives back a .htm file and/or filenames that do not reflect the original filename. \n\nPlease make sure other extensions are not intervening with the download process, for example download managers. Webp /Avif image converter uses a different route to download the (converted) image than the regular \"save as\" function. This route may lead to conflicts with some download managers and producing unexpected results.\n\nPermission justification\n  * storage:      Allows the extension to save your settings.\n  * downloads:    Allows the extension to initiate a file download for the converted image.\n  * contextMenus: Allows the extension to add the \"convert and save\" button to the image contextmenu\n  *  <all_urls>:  Allows the extension to download the image before converting the it."
