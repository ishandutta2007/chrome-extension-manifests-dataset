It has been specifically created for use by teachers of the OCDSB in Ottawa ON.\n\nThe extension converts each of the bubbles in an evidence record to percents and then calculates averages for each expectation, each strand, the term, (optionally) a summative and ultimately a final mark.\n\nYou can adjust the weightings for each expectation and each strand. Witn a simple click, you can `ignore` marks as appropriate for individual students... the ignored marks are omitted from the average calculations.\n\nUltimately, you will have to use your professional judgement before entering your report card marks.  This extension gives you a simple and consistent way to do the calculations all in one space.  You won't have to re-enter marks into a secondary spreadsheet."
