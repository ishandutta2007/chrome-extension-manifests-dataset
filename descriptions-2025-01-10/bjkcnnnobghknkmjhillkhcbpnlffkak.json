It currently supports Radicals, Kanji and Vocabulary. Due to overlaps with Kanji and Vocabulary, it was opted to split these into separate menus. Radicals are searched through dictionaries. Some radicals do not have an Unicode representation and are omitted from the selection and right click method.\n\nThe purpose of this app is to focus solely on Wanikani learning method through mnemonics and their suggested characters."
