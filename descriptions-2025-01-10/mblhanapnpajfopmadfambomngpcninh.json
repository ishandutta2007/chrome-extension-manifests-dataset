It helps in reducing the efforts spent in doing manual testing for verifying user interface. Once all the necessary verify tests are put, the extension runs the tests in no time. The efforts needs only to be put once while creating the tests. Once done, it can be used very easily in any higher environments of software development cycle. The tests written can be exported into a JSON file as well. And similarly a JSON file can be imported as well.\nThis extension is going to be helpful for every software project who spend lots of time in verifying user interfaces repeatedly in all environments."
