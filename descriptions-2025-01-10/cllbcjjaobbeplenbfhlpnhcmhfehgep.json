HistoryTree takes your history and puts it together like a puzzle so that you can determine how you got from one place to another.\n\n* Who is it for?\nAnyone who has ever asked the question, \"How did I get here?\" It's common place to use the computer to work on a homework assignment and then end up watching a video on how JFK's brain went mysteriously missing after his assassination. As I said, \"How did I get there?\"\n\nNote: Your history is something that should be kept private.  Our chrome extension runs entirely on your device within your browser.
