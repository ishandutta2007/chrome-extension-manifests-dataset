As the most recognizable symbol of the Aggie Network, the Aggie Ring is something earned not given.\n\nOne of the greatest moments during an Aggie’s time at Texas A&M is the day he or she receives an Aggie Ring. As the most visible sign of the Aggie Network, the Aggie Ring is a unique representation of achievement, as it can only be ordered when an Aggie completes specific academic requirements.\n\nRingWraps was born in 2011 at Texas A&M University and created to enhance the beauty of the Aggie Ring, adorning it with diamonds that show off an alumni centerpiece.\n\nThe Aggie Ring has been adorned with RingWraps by thousands alumni nationwide and continue to add many more schools and members every year."
