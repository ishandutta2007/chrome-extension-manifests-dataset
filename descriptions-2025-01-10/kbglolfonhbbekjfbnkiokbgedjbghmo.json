This extension, part of m0dest's experimental art series <error messages>, reimagines 404 pages as canvases for artistic expression rather than symbols of being lost. When you encounter a 404 error, instead of seeing a standard error message, you'll experience an artistic intervention that turns these abandoned spaces of the internet into moments of connection and discovery.\n\nThe extension displays carefully curated artwork from the <error messages> series, treating each 404 page as an opportunity to engage with art rather than frustration. Each piece is part of a larger blockchain-backed collection that aims to humanize the web's error pages, turning moments of disconnection into opportunities for artistic encounter.\n\nBy installing this extension, you become part of a movement to transform the internet's forgotten corners into galleries of digital art. Created by artist m0dest, this project envisions a web where getting lost leads to finding something beautiful.\n\nJoin us in reimagining what the internet's empty spaces can become."
