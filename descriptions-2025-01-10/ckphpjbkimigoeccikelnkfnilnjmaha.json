It is basically an unofficial extension that is developed and maintained independently. The official Skype software is only released for smart phones and web. This unofficial extension is a wrapper to the original Skype web app and tries to make it usable as a browser extension. All credits goes to Skype application/Microsoft corp.\n\nClicking on the toolbar button, renders Skype web UI in a standalone window. Moreover, the window is re-sizable to your desired choice. Note, to start using this App, you need to have a Skype account.\n\nSimply click on the toolbar button to open Skype in a simple popup window. Once the UI is closed all background activities are halted. Please note that, this addon does not have any settings or options to adjust.\n\nIf you want to report bugs or have a feature request, please fill the bug report form in the addon homepage (http://mybrowseraddon.com/skype-app.html)."
