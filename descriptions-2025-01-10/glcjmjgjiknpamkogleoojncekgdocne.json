You are one step closer to your dreams.\n\nWith the Smart SERP Data Collector, you can automate your data pulling tasks and curate lists to help you find what you're looking for easily.\n\nThis will become the most valuable tool in your marketing kit. \n\nWork smarter - not harder. With options and settings to setup your collection the way you want it, you never have to worry about scraping erroneous data or wasting usage credits.\n\nUse case examples:\n1) Selling Lawnmowers\nLet's say you're in the business of selling wholesale lawnmowers. Your clients are probably landscape companies. Instead of paying for outdated and unverified lists of contact information, you can run Smart SERP and target landscapers in your area.

You're looking for an allocation. Rather than manually pulling the data for Audi dealerships, you can use the Smart SERP to collect contact data for you. Next, you could do manual outreach or simply feed the spreadsheet to the next part of your automated process.\n\n3) B2B Marketing\nPerhaps you sell marketing and you want to reach out to specific customers about your amazing product.
