This extension adds an option to the right-click menu to generate a textfield popup at the cursor location.\n\nNOTE: Does not work on https://chrome.google.com pages for some reason. So, don't assume it doesn't work if you can't get it working on the store page. Also make sure you refresh any open tabs after installation to get the plugin working on that tab.\n\nLet me know about bugs or feature requests. This extensions was really made for myself, but I'm willing to listen and I might continue developing it."
