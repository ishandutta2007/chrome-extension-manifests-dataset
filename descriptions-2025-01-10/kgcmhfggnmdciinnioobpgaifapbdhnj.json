Millions of users have benefited from our AI Assistant for support with their hardware products. Now it’s time for support teams to enjoy the same. \n\nWith Mavenoid Copilot, your team can quickly discover answers to product questions and share them with customers via any app: Salesforce, Zendesk, Freshdesk, LiveChat, Gmail, etc.\n\nHow is it better than typical knowledge base tools?\n\n1. Accurate. Mavenoid's intelligent search takes into account the context behind requests rather than just matching keywords, so team members receive relevant content suggestions.\n2. Structured. Because of our unique symptom/solution representation, Mavenoid presents knowledge in bite-sized pieces rather than long articles. This helps customers understand the instructions without information overload.\n3. Interactive. Symptoms, solutions and guides shared from the extension are interactive — after seeing the recommended solution, customers can continue to the AI-powered Assistant if they want to ask more questions.\n\nWith Mavenoid’s CoPilot Chrome extension your team members can:\n\n- Quickly find relevant content thanks to AI-powered search, pre-trained for hardware products and services;\n- Preview the content suggestions, including interactive step-by-step guides, images and videos; \n- Share snippets of content in any browser-based app. Choose to send text, all content or interactive Assistant link.\n\nMore improvements coming soon, so stay tuned for updates!"
