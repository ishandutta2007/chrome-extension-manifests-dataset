It is styled to be as minimal and distraction-free as possible. You can set it to use a list you created or any other twitter user's list as long as the list is public.\n\nIf you want this to display your twitter timeline:\n\n1. Create a new list on twitter. Name it anything you want, just make sure it's public.\n2. Add everyone you follow to your list. This website lets you do that quickly and easily: http://twitlistmanager.com\n3. On the options page for this extension, set the username to your twitter username, and the list name to the name of the list you just created. Click save.\n4. All done! \nRemember, any time you follow a user you will also have to add them to this list, and any time you unfollow a user you will have to remove them from this list. I know this is an inconvenience but Twitter and Chrome impose strict limitations that require this.\nHowever,  having a slightly separate feed from your timeline can be a nice feature. For example, try you can add news accounts to your list for this extension, so you get to keep up with the news but still only see your friends' tweet on your twitter.com timeline.\n\n\nNOTICE: I am not affiliated with Twitter inc in any way."
