If you prefer to see your tweets in chronological order, you have to switch back manually every time.\n\nThis tiny extension will switch you back to Latest Tweets automatically every time you load the Twitter homepage.\n\nImportant note: script only works when the page is (re)loaded, but Twitter is navigating between its pages without reloading. So imagine a situation: you left your notifications tab hanging for a while and then come back and hit the home button. Now Twitter will show you the home page without reloading page itself. In this case, the extension would not know that it have to do its job, even if Twitter decided to show you algorithmic feed again. \n\nBut here is the good news â€” you don't have to reach this tiny buttons again, just reload the page with cmd/ctrl + R and enjoy your latest tweets."
