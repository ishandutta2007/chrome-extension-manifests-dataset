Every time you place a booking with one of these partners, the tree-planting assistant will show a pop up asking you whether you'd like to plant a tree with your booking.\n\nIf you select \"Yes, of course\", our partners pay a small amount of money to Click A Tree, which enables us to plant at least one tree for you.\n\nYour bookings won't cost a single Cent extra. The trees are paid for by the marketing budgets of our partners. Hence Click A Tree's tree-planting assistant plants trees completely free of charge for you!\n\nWe focused on functionality and maximum impact, not the design. We hope you'll forgive us for that.\n\nPlease help spread the word by telling your friends, family and work colleagues about this exciting extension. It is the simplest way to turn Google Chrome into a tree-planting browser!"
