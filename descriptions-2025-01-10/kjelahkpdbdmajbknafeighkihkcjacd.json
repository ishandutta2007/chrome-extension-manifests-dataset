No coding required! \n\n* Recording a test is as easy as using your application. \n* Save test suites (and runs) to local disk or your database.\n* Test playback is extremely fast. Every visual pixel difference between what was originally recorded, and any later playback is caught. Brimstone is a visually perfect (pixel accurate) do-no-harm tester. \n* Performance metrics of your app (latency/memory) are captured for every user step you record in a test. Catch memory leaks! Catch degrading performance!"
