Once you are logged into LinkedIN, you can start searching for desired candidates.\nIf you have found a candidate you like, you can upload CV through the plugin to the system.\nOnce the resume is uploaded, all information about the candidate will be automatically added to the candidate's profile in the Nalgoo ATS system. The LinkedIN plugin will show you if candidates are already in your database, helping you prevent uneccessary duplicate profiles. Additionally, the LinkedIN plugin also offers an activity overview and recruitment history for each candidate.\nThe plugin can also be used to send messages to candidates and ask them for GDPR consent, which thanks to pre-made templates can be easily personalized."
