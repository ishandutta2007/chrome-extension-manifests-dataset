The extension will remove all of the user's friends in one go, saving them the time and effort of going through their friend list one by one.\n\n!! What's New !! \n\n- The option to search through friends has been added! Instead of having to read through your infinite friends list, it lets users search for friends by username or display name! \n\n- We added the option of selecting all friends at once because we noted from reading many reviews that individuals found scrolling to be tiresome and would want to have that choice. We heard you when you said it!"
