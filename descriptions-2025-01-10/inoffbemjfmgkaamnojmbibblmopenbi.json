The only option is to manually edit every item one at a time, wasting countless hours. \n\nNeuroPriceFix was created to automate this process, fixing high pricing errors with a single click. \n\nNeuroPriceFix embeds powerful controls at the top of your Amazon Pricing Health page, giving you the option to price higher, lower, or match the following prices:\n\nList Price\nFeatured Price (“Buy Box”)\nAverage Price\nAmazon’s Price\nReference Price\n\nOr, you can just tell NeuroPriceFix to drop all your prices by any dollar amount or percentage you choose. (e.g. “Drop prices of all my stranded inventory by $1.”)\n\nOn top of all this, NeuroPriceFix also gives you the option to bulk edit your min/max price settings, to prevent future high pricing errors. \n\nNeuroPriceFix is the solution to Amazon’s high pricing errors, saving you massive time and getting your inventory back in front of customers."
