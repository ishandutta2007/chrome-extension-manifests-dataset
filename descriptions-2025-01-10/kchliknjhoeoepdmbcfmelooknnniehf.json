No more toggling between multiple image windows or searching for csv in windows. Of course, you don't have to search for where the image folder was, or switch windows at high speed and patiently search for differences while remembering afterimages.\nThis is my personal favorite tool as I spend more than 300 hours a month staring at my computer. Equipped with a GUI that reduces strain on the eyes, it should be able to alleviate the physical burden on image analysts.\nSaizeriya's popular menu can also be used.
