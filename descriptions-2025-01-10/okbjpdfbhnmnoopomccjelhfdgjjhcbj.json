The immune response, called an allergic reaction, occurs because the immune system attacks proteins in the food that are normally harmless. The proteins that trigger the reaction are called allergens.\n\nIs there a Cure? No. To help Americans avoid the health risks posed by food allergens, FDA enforces the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act applies to the labeling of foods regulated by FDA which includes all foods except poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages which are regulated by other Federal agencies. As a result, food labels help allergic consumers identify offending foods or ingredients so they can more easily avoid them.\n\nChallenge with Online Grocery Shopping: Online grocery shopping is gaining traction but most grocery sites don't explicitly specify allergen warnings. Making life harder for buyer to search for allergen warnings in product images."
