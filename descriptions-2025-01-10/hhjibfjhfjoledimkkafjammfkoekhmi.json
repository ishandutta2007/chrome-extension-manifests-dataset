Press F\n\nv1.6: Fixes and Fallbacks\n- All the modules are now toggleable through options menu\n- Added defaults for options, so you won't lose the things you already had\n\nv1.5: Options ðŸŽ›\n- Added an options menu located under your profile popup. Look for \"Toolkit Settings\" over there.\n\nv1.4: Random Games ðŸŽ²\n- Added \"pick a random game\" buttons to main page and specific game pages.\nOn the main page - look for a \"or pick a random one\" sign in the big searchbar.\nOn the game page - look for a \"go to a random game\" sign above the game title\n\nv1.3: Minor fixes\n\nv1.2 : Omnibox and Game Releases\n- Added an \"rg\" omnibox prefix. Just type \"rg\" in a new tab's search bar and press \"tab\" to launch the extension. Then you can type your request to quickly search for a game on RAWG.\n- Added a notification checker that will notify you with a desktop push if a new game from your wishlist was released. This is turned on by default atm, I'm working on a better options menu.\n\nv1.1 Added combo mode! Every time you sort a game - you get a combo counter to go up! Let's see how fast and for how long can you keep it up! (Tweet the highest you get @orels1_)\nThis is an opt-out feature: press Z to disable."
