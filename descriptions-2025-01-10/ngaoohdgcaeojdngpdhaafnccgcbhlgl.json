Each platform has a default system prompt, so there is no need to add a custom prompt unless you prefer to do so.\n\n- If you add a custom prompt, you can select it from the prompt gallery.\n\n- To make your OpenAI API Key work, you need to enable billing on your OpenAI dashboard -> https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview\n\n- If your OpenAI API key initially works and then stops, please try to generate another API key and validate it in the Comment-AI settings.\n\n5.
