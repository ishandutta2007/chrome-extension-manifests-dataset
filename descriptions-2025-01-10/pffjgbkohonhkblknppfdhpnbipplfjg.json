It easy with keyboard shortcuts, just type l (for label) and then mon and hit enter.\n\nBy default the message will be marked as unread and put back in your inbox at around 5am on Monday. If you want it to come back at a different time then you can mark it to come back when you're at work (10AM), tonight (5PM) or midnight.\n\nIf you want to snooze for more than a week you can add a Snooze/Skip/1 week on label. This will snooze until the next but one Monday. You can skip up to 4 weeks.\n\nIf you only add a Snooze/Time/... label then the next time that time comes up the message will be un-snoozed.\n\nPRO-TIP: I email myself at an address like myaddress+tonight@example.com and have a gmail filter to mark it as read, archive it and add the Snooze/Time/Tonight label. Then I can email myself things to do tonight.\n\nIf you would rather run your own copy you can add the source from wtwf.com/snoozesrc to script.google.com and run that.\n\nYou can uninstall this app by searching for and cliking on Gmail Snooze under Apps connected to your acocunt at https://myaccount.google.com/permissions Then click on Remove."
