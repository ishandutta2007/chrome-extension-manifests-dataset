Even small variations in measurements can drastically alter the appearance of a face.\n\nThis Chrome extension is designed to assist artists struggling with facial proportions. Built on the principles of the Loomis portrait method, it enables users to sketch faces with precision. Additionally, it empowers artists to depict any desired facial features accurately.\n\nOver time, this tool aids artists in developing a keen instinct for facial nuances. By understanding the unique characteristics of each individual's face, artists can enhance their ability to capture likeness in their sketches.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions for improvement. I'm always eager to assist! ðŸ˜Š"
