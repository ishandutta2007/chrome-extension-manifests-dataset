Simply select the anticipated time commitment along with the estimated level of complexity, and let the calculator do the rest!\n\nOnce you're satisfied with the results, click the copy button to instantly copy the story point value to your clipboard, then paste in Jira, Asana, or your project management software of choice. \n\nYou can use Scrumulator by itself, or as part of an established process like story point poker. \n\nEither way, you will never second guess the accuracy or consistency of your story points again."
