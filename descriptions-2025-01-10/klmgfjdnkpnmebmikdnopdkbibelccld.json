And even though that kind of makes sense, it could sometimes be a bit annoying. üî•\n\nWith this teeny tiny little extension - you'll be able to copy your dependencies from other popular package managers, such as Yarn or Bun install. Is the package something you wouldn't like to have in your dependencies? Fret not! Nopy also gives you the option to copy the install commando for development dependencies (and package types!). üëå\n\nNopy takes all your favorite package managers and slams them right into NPM - to make it as easy as possible to install dependencies. The currently supported options are the following:\nNPM\nYarn\nBun\nPnpm\n\nNopy is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with NPM, npmjs, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates. The official NPM website can be found at https://www.npmjs.com/."
