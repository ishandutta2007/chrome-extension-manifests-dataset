Most of the people plant it in their office or home because it looks attractive.\n\n1. Lights\nLollipop plant looks very beautiful with bright flowers, so it needs indirect sunlight, which means cool morning sun rays are best for this plant. You should plant this plant in such a place where there is direct sunlight. The plant should receive proper sunlight in the morning and cool shade in the afternoon.\n\nThis plant flourishes well in sufficient sunlight. However, this plant can also stand in partial shade. But it cannot grow flowers properly. Hence cool shade and cool rays are necessary not only for Lollipop plant but for any other plant.\n\n2. Water\nWater is also necessary for any plant, all living beings on earth cannot survive without water. But any plant can die due to excessive water. So make sure that the pot in which you are planting the Lollipop plant has water. There is drainage, if you do not have such a pot then you can make a hole in the bottom of the pot or pot so that the water will drain out automatically.\n\nDo not water more than necessary, water only if you feel that the upper part of the soil is dry, otherwise do not water. More than necessary water can cause rotting of the plantâ€™s roots. There should always be moisture and there should not be too much moisture.\n\n3. Soil\nSoil also plays a big role in the growth of any plant, just as sandy soil is best for a coconut tree. Similarly, the Lollipop tree requires slightly acidic and well-drained soil. Mix decent, well-drained soil with equal parts perlite, peat moss and vermiculite. Do not use soil that is too alkaline as it may cause the leaves to yellow.\n\n4. Temperature\nHowever it is not necessary to pay attention to the temperature for big trees like coconut, seguan, peepal, etc. Because all these are very big trees whose roots spread deep inside. But Lollipop plant is a plant, its roots are only a few feet deep in the soil. It is limited to depth, and if you keep this plant in a small pot, then it forms limited roots in that pot only.\n\nTherefore, it is important to pay attention to the temperature. This plant requires a temperature between 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year. Like other plants. This plant can also tolerate slightly cooler temperatures at night, but keep in mind that do not keep this plant in a temperature below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to high temperature. The leaves of the plant may turn yellow and due to lower temperature, the plant does not grow properly.\n\n5. To fertilize\nAfter a few days of planting the plant, when it starts growing on its own, then give it a scratch as per requirement. Every 15-20 days, you need to add proper quantity of manure. You can use the household mixture in manure or you can You can also use store-bought fertilizers; if you are a gardener, use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer.\n\nFertilizer like Cocopit is better for this plant.
