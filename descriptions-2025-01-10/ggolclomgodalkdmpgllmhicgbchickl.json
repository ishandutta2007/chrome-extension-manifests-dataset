This addon lets you overcome this issue by capturing the underlying text behind the HTML document. When the addon is active, you can select any section of the page and copy the resulting text to the clipboard via the copy button at the top-right corner of the page popup. The toolbar button has a red color when the addon is active and a grey color in the inactive state. If you right-click on the toolbar button, there are two select methods to choose from. Try to see which one works best for you.\n\nNote: reloading or scrolling the page inactivates the addon. Please press the toolbar button again to activate it.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/select-copy-html-text.html)."
