Normally under the ''Other Bookmarks\" folder.\n\nWhen you use it for ungrouped tabs, the folder name is the bookmarks directory will be the date and time.\n\nIn case your window contains groups and some ungrouped tabs, the calculation is based on the current active tab. If it is grouped we store the whole group, if it is ungrouped we store all the ungrouped.\n\nTIP: from your bookmarks bar, the opposite is possible. \nYou right click on a folder, and you can open all its tabs in all possible ways, including in a new group. \nFor some reason the group option is not available from your chrome://bookmarks/ page at the moment.\n\nThe code is open source, feel free to suggest features and contribute extra functionality"
