This extension is only works on Github website.\n\nFeatures:\n- Allow to customize width for currently uploaded or the previously uploaded screenshots\n- Allow to move all the screenshots to screenshots section if available in the PR.\n\nNote:\n- Currently `Move to screenshots` will only move the images if the screenshot section is available. There is no option to customize this but maybe I will update in the future for adding support for that feature as well."
