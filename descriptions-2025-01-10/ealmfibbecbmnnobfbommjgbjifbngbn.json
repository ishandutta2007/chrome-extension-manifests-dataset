Each entity is scored based on 4 categories: Commitment to individual freedoms as expressed in the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution , Political bias (left or right), Transparency and Objectivity (mostly for news sites).  The aggregate of these scores are displayed with a different icon that changes shapes and colors to for each entity score.\n\nThese scores are entered by regular users and are processed by a sophisticated algorithm to ensure accuracy.  With each score that a user enters for an entity, their own trust rating either increases or decreases based on accuracy.  Users start at trust level 10 when they sign up and can go all the way to trust level 1.  Once a user reaches a trust level of 4, they are paid a $100 bonus (subject to change and based on eligibility requirements).\n\nUsers are encouraged to do business with companies that have a high freedom score."
