Users are only allowed to license AP-owned content, but the AP website doesn't filter for this content unless the user is logged in, which the user can sometimes forget. This extension checks to make sure that the user is in fact logged in and flashes a warning screen if they're not. It also flags clips that appear to not be AP-owned if the user tries to open a link to one.\n\nVERSION HISTORY:\n1.5.0: Add a check for texted \"CR\" versions of stories.\n1.4.0: Add a link to be able to search for unknown source. Reduce required permissions.\n1.3.0: Display the unknown source when a source can't be found\n1.2.0: Check with a Google Spreadsheet for safe AP-owned sources\n1.0: Initial release"
