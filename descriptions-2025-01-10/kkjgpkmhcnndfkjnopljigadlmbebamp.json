When you click on the extension you can see 2 circles, in the left one you need to click your password sequence, and when finished, click the right circle so you can log in and see your bookmarks.\n\n***PLEASE NOTE***\n- Bookmarks are saved in the browser local storage meaning that they will persist only when saved in the NON-incognito browser window. That is why for saving from incognito windows, you need to copy the URL and paste it into extension popup input and click \"SAVE FROM INPUT\".\n-In order to open multiple links in the same incognito window, you need to enable the extension to run in incognito mode.\n- Although is almost impossible for non-technical people to figure out that you hid something in the extension, let alone crack the click password, please note that some developers can easily find the contents of the bookmarks in the storage. They are encoded, but still, they can be cracked by a tech person."
