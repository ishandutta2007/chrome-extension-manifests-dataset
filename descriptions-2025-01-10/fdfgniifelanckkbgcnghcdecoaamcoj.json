Users are updated in a private DM (need to follow @sane_social) once a tweet they reported has been removed, a user they reported has been suspended or a twitter account they reported has been permanently deleted from Twitter.\n\n④ 𝗩𝗶𝗼𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗘𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲\nThe extension collects digital evidence on each violation reported. Once a Tweet is removed by Twitter following a report with the extension, the user will receive all the relevant evidence, including a screenshot of the removed tweet, discretely in a DM message (need to follow @sane_social).\n\n⑤ 𝗔𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀\nSocial media violence and or targeted harassment often involves the discrimination of whole communites. The extension enables the user to involve their community for fast, easy and most important, discrete reporting of the same violating content. Statistics show that the more people report a given tweet, the faster Twitter attends to the report and the more likely it will be removed."
