This extension is especially applicable for developers who work on a per-hour basis, as they can manage the amount of time spent on a project with this extension running in the background. Code logger also sends desktop notifications to users after an hour has passed, alerting them to take a break. Break notifications can be adjusted to be sent every hour (by default), two hours, or three hours. This concept is based on the Pomodoro Technique, which states that frequent breaks can increase mental agility.\n\nUse: to start a session, simply click main button. The timer will run in the background if you close Chrome. Notifications will be sent at the specified time intervals. To stop the timer, either click on the desktop notification or click the main button again. Immediately after ending a session, you will see the session time added to your weekly time spent metric, as well as the all-time spent metric.\n\nCredit to Artur Stolear for help with the development of this extension."
