Read discussions about your current topic and discover the communities that share your interests.\n\nHOW IT WORKS: Simply browse the web as normal. When the extension icon shows a red badge, click it to see what Thredd has found. You can read, reply to, or even start your own discussions. Don't forget to check out the various Reddit communities you stumble upon to see what else they've been sharing!\n\nNOTE:\n* The notice you see about having access to your history and website data is automatically generated because Thredd runs on every tab. But it does not actually monitor your browsing history or require your personal information to work properly.\n\n\nAvailable on Chrome and Firefox"
