Whether you are an SEO specialist, content creator, or web developer, this extension makes it easy to distinguish between internal and external dofollow links by highlighting them with different colored borders. You can also clear the highlighting anytime with a single click using the \"Clear\" button.\n\n‚ú® Features:\n\n- Highlight Internal Links: Quickly identify all internal dofollow links on a webpage. Internal links (those that point to pages within the same domain) are highlighted with a green border.\n\n- Highlight External Links: Easily spot external dofollow links, which lead to websites outside the current domain. External links are shown with a blue border.\n\n- Highlight Both Internal and External Links: Choose to highlight both internal and external dofollow links simultaneously, with internal links in green and external links in blue.\n\n- Clear Highlighting: The extension includes a \"Clear\" button, allowing you to remove all link borders with one click. This helps you quickly reset the page to its original state.\n\n- Modern, User-Friendly Interface: The extension features a clean, modern interface with button-like controls for selecting highlighting options.

Optimize Content and Backlinking: Easily verify which links contribute to SEO, making it simpler to manage internal linking structures or audit backlinking strategies.\n\n3. Clear and Reset Anytime: The \"Clear\" button lets you reset the page and remove all highlighting without needing to refresh the page.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:\n\n1. Internal Links: Internal links within the same domain are highlighted with a green border.\n2. External Links: External links leading to other websites are highlighted with a blue border.\n3. Clear Highlighting: Click the \"Clear\" button to instantly remove all borders from links and reset the page to its original state.\n\nüìä Perfect for SEO Analysis:\n\n- Webmasters: Audit your website and optimize your internal linking structure for better SEO performance.\n- SEO Analysts: Evaluate how internal and external links are distributed across webpages.\n- Marketers: Understand link structures in content and ensure links are following correct dofollow or nofollow attributes.\n- Content Creators: Quickly verify the status of links within your content to ensure you‚Äôre passing link juice appropriately.\n\nüöÄ Key Benefits:\n\n- Fast & Lightweight: The extension is lightweight and doesn‚Äôt slow down your browser. It only activates when you click the extension icon.\n- Works on Any Page: Whether you're on your own website or analyzing an external site, this extension works on any webpage.\n- No Setup Required: Install the extension and start using it immediately. No complex settings or configurations needed.\n- Clear Highlighting Anytime: Easily reset the highlighting on a webpage with the \"Clear\" button, without refreshing the page.\n- No Data Collection: The extension does not track, collect, or store any personal data, ensuring your privacy is protected.\n\nüõ† How to Get Started:\n\n1.
