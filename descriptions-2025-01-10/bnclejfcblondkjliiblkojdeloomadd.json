This was deemed \"not good enough\", as the Chrome developers wanted to remove the need for users to manually control tab audio, so it was removed in favour of the \"Mute Site\" feature.\n\nChrome can't yet automatically determine which tabs should be playing audio, so I made this extension to let the user make that decision. The button's in a different place due to Chrome API limitations, but apart from that, this extension should work exactly as the old \"Mute Tab\" feature did.\n\nHaving trouble? Email support: support@tab.muter.computer\n\nIf you find Tab Muter useful, feel free to leave me a tip: https://ko-fi.com/sersorrel\n\nThis extension is free software; the source code is available at https://github.com/sersorrel/mute-tab."
