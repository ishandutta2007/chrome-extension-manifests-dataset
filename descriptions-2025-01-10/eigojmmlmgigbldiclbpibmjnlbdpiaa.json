It means removing page anchor (#xxx), query string (?xxx), file or the last directory (/xxx), port number (:xxx), sub-domain (xxx.) or secure layer (https -> http), whichever is first found (preserving mentioned order).\n\nYou can use the mouse and click NavigUp's icon (present on the right side of the address bar) or go with the keyboard and press one of the supported shortcuts.\n\n== Shortcuts ==\nUse (Ctrl+)(Shift+)Alt+Up for it. Shift means going up one more level, Ctrl - additional two levels. Ctrl and Shift can be combined. If you click extension's icon (in the address bar) many times within one third of second, then you'll go up many levels at once.\n\n== Permissions ==\n1. \"Access your data on all websites.\"\n(content script executed when URL matches \"http://*/*\", \"https://*/*\", \"ftp://*/*\")\nContent script is used only for catching keyboard shortcuts (commands API doesn't support Ctrl+Alt combinations) and setting up a popup (if it is turned on).\n2. \"Access your tabs and browsing activity.\"\n(\"tabs\" permission)\n\"tabs\" permission is a broad one, but it is used only for accessing or modifying particular tab's URL within background page.\n\n== File scheme ==\nIf you install NavigUp from Chrome Web Store, then it's not supported. However, some users browse occasionally local file system using Chrome to load some files. NavigUp is also very useful in this case, but setting content script to match also file: addresses gives you following message during installation: \"This extension will have full access to your computer and private data.\" File scheme is supported only in the version hosted at my website.\n\n== Changed name ==\nOlder version of this extension was called \"GoUp\". I came up with this name and I liked it, because it was the simplest self-explanatory title. I published the extension in November 2009 on my site and chromeextensions.org. Back then, as a Uppity user, I wasn't aware of the another Firefox add-on doing same job. That add-on is called Go Up. I don't like reusing already existing names, especially by similar projects, so decision about renaming was obvious solution for this unpleasant situation.\n\nLater I also found out, that a few weeks after my announcement of GoUp, Christophe Benz created (according to his GitHub repository first commit was authored on December 11, 2009) \"Go Up\" extension (notice the space between Go and Up, so itâ€™s the exact name of existing Firefox add-on). Thus I was even more convinced that changing name was the right thing.\n\n== License ==\nExtension's code is licensed under Affero GPL v3.\nIcon is licensed under GPL v2.\n\n== Credits ==\nIcon is done by Marco Tessarotto and it's part of Ultimate Gnome icon theme.\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ultimate-gnome/"
