Now your cards get colored according to their status. In addition, your lists can be displayed horizontally, on a grid layout or in multiple swimlanes. PS You can enable only coloring or layouts if you prefer.\n\nRead my blog post for learn more about the concept: https://medium.com/@gwened/7-ways-of-keeping-track-of-your-todos-2b86b85ecab3\n\nUsage:\n1. Install the TredoList extension\nNote: Chrome will ask you for permission to view your browsing history. Apart from modifying the style of your open Trello pages, TredoList does not and will NOT collect, save, or transmit your browsing history or your Trello data.\n2. Go to Trello.com, sign in and visit your favourite board\n3. The TredoList button becomes active in the Chrome toolbar. Click it!\n4. Change the layout and colors, or visit the \"What's This\" button to learn more.\n\nThis extension is a companion for Trello.com boards, but the author is not affiliated to Trello or Atlassian Corp.\nSpecial thanks to Natalie Chouinard for the initial work on List Layouts for Trello.\n\nKnow bug:\nMoving cards when using swimlanes does not always work as intended. You can temporarily disable the layout and try again."
