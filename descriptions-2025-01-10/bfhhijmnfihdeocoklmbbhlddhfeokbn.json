Our users have reported both an increase in followers *and* an increase in readership after using this bot.\n\nAre you worried about being banned or suspended from Medium.com for using this bot?  \n———————————————————————————————————————————————\nDon’t be! Since this is a Chrome extension rather than an app, Medium.com is unable to differentiate between your clicks and the bot’s since they share the same browser fingerprint.  To date, we’ve yet to have a *single* user report being suspended by Medium.com while using this bot.\n\nOk, I'm sold, how do I use it?  I’m glad you asked…\n\nFollowing Users\n—————————\nTo begin following users, go to a target users followers list. You will see a “Follow All” button next to the number of followers the target user has. After clicking “Follow All” the bot will begin to scroll to the bottom of the target user’s follower list. When the bot reaches the bottom of the list, it will begin to follow the users on the page, maintaining the list of users it has followed so as to not follow them again later.\n\nUnfollowing Users\n——————————\nTo begin unfollowing users, go to your account’s following list. You will see an “Unfollow All” button next to your follower count. After clicking “Unfollow All” the bot will begin to scroll to the bottom of your follower list. When the bot reaches the bottom of the list, it will begin to unfollow the users on the page.\n\nThe Whitelist\n————————\nThe Medium Auto Follow Bot also contains a whitelist which is accessed by clicking on the browser extension icon. Type the Medium.com usernames with a @ before the username, separated by a comma into the input and click “Submit Whitelist” and these users will never be unfollowed by The Medium Auto Follow Bot.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n————————\nThe Medium Auto Follow Bot stores the users that you’ve followed using the bot, the date that you followed them, and the users in your whitelist. This data is only stored to provide you the best product. This data is stored in your browser and is only used by your bot on your browser and no where else. This data never leaves your laptop and is in no way used for analysis or tracking by The Medium Auto Follow Bot team or any other third parties.\n\n\nYou can also contact the The Medium Auto Follow Bot team via Email, Facebook, or Twitter from directly in the extension. We love hearing from customers!"
