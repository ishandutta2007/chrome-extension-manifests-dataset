Made especially for golfers that don't rely on meters, you'll now be able to see distances in yards. \n\nSteps to use:\n1. Navigate to Google Maps\n2. Right click on the map and select \"Measure distance\" \n3. Click another spot on the map. You'll now see a box at the bottom of the screen listing the distance in Feet and Meters \n4. Hover your mouse on that box to see the calculation into Yards\n5. Check this video for a walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DhtIXmykSs\n\nIf you're still having problems with the extension, please email me at adsbxaddon@gmail.com."
