As you learn more kanji, your webpages begin to fill up with kanji! WaniKanify 2.0 can find words anywhere on a webpage and replace it for kanji characters. It is a great utility for practicing and recalling vocabulary you may have forgotten.\n\nTo get started, install the extension, and go to the options page. Add your public WaniKani API key, which can be found on the WaniKani website, and hit save.\n\nNavigate to your favorite webpages, hit the Crabigator and read as normal. As you read, you'll come across kanji characters you should know. Do you remember what the mean? How to pronounce them?\n\nYou can test the extension out by installing the Chrome Extension and viewing this simple pastebin page:\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/9hDg3y6A\n\nHave a suggestion, want to contribute, or found an issue? \nView the GitHub project for WaniKani 2.0 here:\nhttps://github.com/ThePieMonster/WaniKanify-2.0"
