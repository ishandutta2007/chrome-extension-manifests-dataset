This is inimical to people with disabilities and restricts involving them within the Internet Community. We were determined to change this. We built Someity to serve as an all-in-one accessibility and productivity tool without having the website makers change a single line of source code.\n\nWe want our users with varied abilities to feel empowered and confident on the Internet just like their more fortunate peers. We want them to feel brave and fearless - just like Someity.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Someity Actions\n• Color Blind Aid\n• Font Type\n• Focus Mode\n• Text-to-speech\n• Text Zoomer\n• Font Color\n• Magnifier\n• Cursor Customizer\n• Screen Capture\n• Print Page\n\nIntroducing Someity Actions\n\nWith Someity Actions you can have Someity:\n• Open any website on the Internet by just naming it.\n• Google anything for you.\n• Play a song on YouTube.\n• Translate from any language to English.\n• Google Map directions from any location to any other location in the world just by naming the two cities.\n\nWebsite\nhttps://someity.tech\n\nSupport\nFeatures, bugs and improvements welcome over here:\nhttps://github.com/RonLek/Someity/issues"
