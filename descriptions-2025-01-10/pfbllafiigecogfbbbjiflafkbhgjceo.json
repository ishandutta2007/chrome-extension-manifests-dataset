On this new tab you can donate tabs and see real-time donations around the world and 3 banner ads.\n\nAs you open tabs while browsing the internet, you earn \"tab points\" which represent the ad-revenue raised with the tabs that you've opened! Then you just have to select which research subjects you want to donate you tabs to - and you're done!\n\nAt the end of each trimester, the money raised is distributed across all research projects and you receive your own personal impact report with information about how the Research that you've supported has been progressing!\n\nNew Partners: University of Porto's Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S);"
