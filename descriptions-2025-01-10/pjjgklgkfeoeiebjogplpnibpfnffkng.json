This extension enables you to hide each of these parts selectively, and even block access to any of these websites.\n\nYour settings are synced over the google account so that you can use this extension in multiple computers with the same settings.\n\nNote: No history is accessed by the extension and WE DO NOT send/store any browsing related information.\n\nAll feedback is welcome.\n\nVersion 3.0 new paid features:\n● Lock settings with a password\n● Disable filters on certain days\n● Scholarship for Students\n\nResources we love:\n● Deep Work by Cal Newport\n● Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nExtension developed by: @tweetjai\nLogo designed by: vaibhavdewangan17.wixsite.com/mysite"
