For the people out there who love the progress bars of WeBWorK, we've got you covered! The progress bars show different colours depending on the completion percentage of the assignment, and the due date of the assignment. This makes it easier to view at a glance whether an assignment can be completed for credit without having to read through the large amount of text PrarieLearn shows by default."
