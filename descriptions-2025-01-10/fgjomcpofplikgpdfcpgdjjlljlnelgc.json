You will instantly be able to find groups of multiple tabs from the same website, as they will be moved into their own new Chrome window.\n\nIf there are 3 or more tabs from the same website, or if they share a common path on one website, they will be pulled into their own window. TabSorter will try to keep the most specifically related tabs in the same place. This is helpful if you have many tabs open from different sections of a single website - each section will open in a dedicated window.\n\nUse this in conjunction with one of the merge all windows extensions to instantly and effortlessly organize all your tabs and windows."
