Users should install this extension to be able to listen to streams which were specifically encrypted through https://www.maudify.io\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1) A live streamer or video uploader encrypts their audio through the homepage of https://www.maudify.io. The encryption process generates an alphanumeric key which can be used to decode the audio.\n2) A viewer/listener navigates in the browser to the place where the video is located. They should begin playing the video.\n3) The user then opens the Audio Decrypter extension pop-up window from the Chrome tray. The decryption key is entered and the unencrypted audio should start immediately playing.\n\nOverall, the encryption/decryption process enables streamers and listeners to enjoy an extra layer of security and privacy.\n\nGo to https://www.maudify.io to learn more about the process!"
