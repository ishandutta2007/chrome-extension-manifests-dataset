In a multi account environment this is a very useful tool to help you to quickly identify the current account. \n\nA new feature has been added so you can import the accounts from the AWS SSO start page. This makes maintaining the accounts in this extension a lot easier.\n\nAs from version 1.1.0 we stopped using an extra row on the navbar for the description as certain console feature were designed with a fixed position what would make it impossible to access certain functionalities of the AWS Console. Instead, we moved the description to the lower bar where enough space is available to add the description.\n\nversion 1.2.1: Fix Account detection and improve style."
