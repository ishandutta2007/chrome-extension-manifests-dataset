Then, when the website is live, install this extension and visit your page. You'll see a pedit logo in the address bar. Click it, set up pedit and from there on out, you have full control of your webpage.\n\n**For Developers**\n\nTo make your website pedit ready, visit http://github.com/pranaygp/pedit , and download the files in the JSIncludes folder. (You will also need jQuery and the Firebase JS SDK as dependencies).\n\nThen, use the \"data-pedit\" html attribute on text that should be editable and give each one it's own unique ID.\n\nExample: <p data-pedit=\"editableParagraphs\"></p>\n\nAnd you're all set.\n\nIt's as easy as that!"
