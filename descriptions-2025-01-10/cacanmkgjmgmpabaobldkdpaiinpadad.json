Whether you're reading a blog, watching a video, or using GPT for assistance, Learnify quietly tracks, verifies, and documents your learning journey.\n\nAs you engage with content, Learnify records what you learn, tracks your time, and categorizes the skills you’re developing—whether in marketing, sales, or any other field. Once you’ve completed your learning session, it generates a quiz to assess your understanding, and your progress is displayed on a personalized dashboard with detailed metrics and charts.\n\nLearnify goes beyond tracking. It provides a shareable learning summary that can be posted directly to LinkedIn, showcasing your continuous learning and growth to potential employers. In an age where 90% of recruiters value self-learning but struggle to verify these skills, Learnify bridges the gap, making your learning journey visible and verifiable.\n\nStart using Learnify today to turn your self-directed learning into a live CV that highlights your professional growth.\n\n\nThis is a beta version of our application, which is still undergoing testing and development. While we will ensure the best user experience, please be aware that some features may be incomplete or may not function as expected. We are actively refining and testing the app’s concept, and your feedback is valuable in helping us improve mailing us at support@learnfy.world"
