Each service you sign up for stores your under a different hash.\n\nWhen some service gets hacked and the attackers obtain email and password combinations, they can't use it to brute force other services you might use, due to the different hash.\n\nAdditionally you can choose between plus addressing and custom domains. In the case of custom domains, you supply the domain and Mail Hash adds a random hash to use with catch-all email filter.\ne.g. your-domain.com becomes hiuaiu4szdiu6as6g1@your-domain.com\n\nPlease use it in combination with a password manager. \n\nCode available at https://github.com/jsvde/Mail-Hash\n\nFeedback welcome!"
