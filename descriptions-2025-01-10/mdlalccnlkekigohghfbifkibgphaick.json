It automatically submits search queries to Google up to six times a day. Their results are then sent to a University server in Kaiserslautern, Germany. We collect data, analyze it and publish some of it along with the results when the project is finished.\nFirst, you will have to fill in a demographic survey to provide some statistical data and allow us to assign you to a study with respective settings such as a set of keywords and the URL of a search provider.\nThe plugin sends the query along with the current settings of the plugin, and a study ID. To do this, a tab must be opened, which closes again after retrieving the data. The plugin then sends details such as URL, title and content on web search results, advertising and top stories.\nTaking part in the study is free and will not be compensated. You contribute to a scientific cause and results will be provided to the public with an open source licence.\nThe project is concerned with black boxing socially relevant algorithms.
