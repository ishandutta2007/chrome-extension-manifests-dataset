Everything you need, nothing you don't.\"\n\nThat's what Jack Butcher from Visualize Value said about the Daily Manifest when he created it, and i couldn't say it better if i tried. \n\nI've taken his game changing Daily Manifest PDF and altered it ever so slightly to suit my preferred new tab function. This way every time i open a new tab i'm prompted to double check where i'm at in my days schedule, what are my short, medium and longterm goals and optional habit tracking and reflection. \n\nThis simple protocol changed my life and i hope it helps you too.\n\nAll entries stay in your visual planner unless you manually backspace it, press x to delete it or clear all to totally wipe the page."
