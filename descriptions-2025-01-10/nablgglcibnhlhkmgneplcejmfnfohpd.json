View on GitHub here: https://bit.ly/L2G-GH\n\n\nAuth token\n----------------------\nA GitHub authentication token is required. This can be done by going to profile > settings > developer settings > personal access tokens > fine-grained tokens OR tokens (classic). It is recommended to ensure the token can be used to delete and create repos, see repo information, see commit/file information, and create/commit to files. This token is only stored in your Chrome account storage.\n\n\nCommit file structure\n----------------------\nAll LeetCode problems are separated by folders, and solutions are in each folder and separated by languages. To view submission statistics, look at the extended commit description.\n\n\nThank you!\n----------------------\nI hope this helps you boost your coding portfolio and boast your dedication to mastering technical interviews! :)\nI'd love to hear about how this has helped you!\nIf it really helped you a lot, please consider donating to me on PayPal or connecting with me on LinkedIn/GitHub. Thank you!"
