Unlike other custom cursor extensions, Cheer Cursor pairs your custom cursors with animated cheerleaders performing different dance styles for an extra dose of fun.\n\nKey Features:\n\n1) Dynamic Cheerleader Animations \n\nYour cursor is accompanied by animated cheerleaders who follow its movements and showcase new dance moves based on your actions, such as hovering over a link.\n\n2) Random Cursor and Lock Option\n\nEach time you load a page, a random cursor pack is chosen from a collection of 20 unique designs. If you find one you love, you can lock it on the settings page with a single click to toggle the lock on or off.\n\n3) Customizable Experience\n  \n  - Enable or disable Cheer Cursor features anytime using the toggle switch in the top-right corner of the settings page.\n  - Prefer the custom cursor without animations? Uncheck the \"Show Motion\" option to keep it simple.\n\nTransform everyday browsing into an exciting and playful adventure with Cheer Cursor. Say goodbye to dull cursors and hello to fun!\n\n4) Get More Animations\n\nBy default, 20 animations are displayed on the settings page, and you can choose from them. If you'd like to access more animations, simply click the corresponding button to be redirected to the Cheergame.co website, where you can exchange points for additional animations. Upon registering an account, you will receive 30 points to get started.\n\nThe algorithms of animating cheerleaders refer to the open-source project: https://github.com/facebookresearch/AnimatedDrawings"
