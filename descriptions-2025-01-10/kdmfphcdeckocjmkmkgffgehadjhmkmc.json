I created tabclip because I wanted a similar extension that looked and worked the same in both Chrome and Firefox. Tabclip was written from scratch and shares no code with the \"Copy All Urls\" Chrome extension.\n\ntabclip's icon was made by Freepik from flaticon.com (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik)."
