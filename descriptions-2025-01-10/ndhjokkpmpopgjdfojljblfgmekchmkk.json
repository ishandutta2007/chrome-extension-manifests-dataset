Take a moment each day to rate your happiness and track your emotional well-being over time. This extension encourages self-reflection, helping you cultivate a positive mindset and healthy habits. By regularly reflecting on your mood, you can identify patterns, celebrate your joyful days, and work towards greater happiness.\n\nHow to use\nAll that is required are 2 button clicks.\n\nThe user can record their happiness by selecting one of the five emojis - 😭, 😢, 😐, 😊 & 😁 (from very sad to very happy). Once selected, the user can save their happiness by clicking \"Save\". They also have the option to write a short memo on what happened that day that made them feel the way they chose. Only a maximum of 100 characters (about 30-40 words) are allowed. Any missing days will be left as blank so don't forget to rate your day!\n\nThe user has one whole day to record their happiness for that day. The user can change their happiness during the day if they want to. However, once the day is over, they cannot go back to change it anymore. This is a reminder that you cannot change the past! Let's make the future better!\n\nYou can reflect on how happy or sad you have been for the past days & months. There is a link at the top of the pop-up that says \"Happiness History\". Click that to see your happiness all the way from the beginning of the year till today!\n\nYou will find a summary of how many days you have been happy or sad at the top of the history page. You can also hover over each day to read the comments you've added.\n\nEnjoy the journey!\n\nPrivacy\n\"My Happiness\" uses local storage to store the data. This means the data is stored only on your computer where you measure your happiness."
