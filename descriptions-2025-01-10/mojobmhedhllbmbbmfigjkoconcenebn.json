To support form-based websites, we also offer a browser extension that automatically fills in credentials saved before for these types of websites. These usernames and passwords are organizational and added by customers using our portal, and they are kept encrypted on our servers. The SecurifyID extension works as follows: \n1) After a user logs in, a list of users' single sign on websites is downloaded and stored. \n2) The user can either open a website through the extension or the SecurifyID portal. \n3) The extension sends a query to the back-end server and requests the user's password for that particular website. \n4) The extension fills in the username and password fields and logs the user in accordingly."
