NOT a Heavybit's official.\n\nPodcast programs published on the Heavybit website (https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/) have rich contents and nice features (e.g. instantly jump to any point on the transcript by one click, etc.). It is very good as an English learning material for engineers. However, since I found some improvement points from a personal point of view, I tried to compensate them with this Chrome extension.\n\n# Features\n1. Change playback speed options (1x, 1.5x, 2x → 0.7x, 0.8x, 1x)\n2. Coloring for each speakers\n3. Key shortcuts\n    [space] : Play and pause\n    [left arrow] : 7 seconds rewind\n    [right arrow] : 7 seconds fast\n    s : Skip intro (Set current time to 00:50)\n\n# Change log\nhttps://github.com/noracast/heavybit-extension/releases\n\n# More information\nhttps://github.com/noracast/heavybit-extension"
