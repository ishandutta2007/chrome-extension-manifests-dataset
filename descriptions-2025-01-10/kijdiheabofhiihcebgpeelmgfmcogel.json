You can later open and close all those tabs with a single click. You can also create and remove groups with a single click.\n\nMinimum memory use\n\nWhen tabs are grouped, they require no memory anymore. When the extension's view is closed, the extension will also unload and use zero memory. (Chrome's extension page will show 'inactive')\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nThis extension works completely offline. No scripts, fonts or other content is loaded from other servers. (despite the favicons). It uses no analytics or other tracking as many similar extensions do.  In fact this is the main reason why this extension has been developed.\n\nChangelog\n\n0.5.2 - 2017-12-17\n\nChanged\n- Fix API to LocalStorage"
