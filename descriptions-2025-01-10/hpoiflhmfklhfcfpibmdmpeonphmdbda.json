For example: \"extension\"\n\nInstall and pin the extension in Chrome so it's always visible \n\nOpen the extension options (right-click the icon > Configure), then:\n\n- Set the URL of your view as seen in your browser, for example https://my-home-assistant.com/lovelace/extension\n- Adjust width and height so everything looks good\n- You can choose to crop the upper part of your view to hide the page header. By default, the size of the header is 56 pixels"
