Most make our lives easier, but some have undesired effects from clogging the browser's resources to injecting ads,  violating privacy by planting trackers, to creating borderline malicious activity.\n\nDoctor's \"Browser X-ray\" treats your browser to detect such parasite-like extensions.\nGet a quick examination by the Doctor and revitalize your browser to make it run like the day your first installed it.\n\nDoctor's free version allows on-demand scanning and \"healing\" for known bad extensions. \nDoctor's premium version performs scans automatically and periodically without any user interaction. \n\n* Update: The premium version is currently unavailable due to store policy changes regarding in-app extensions payments."
