Many of these services fail to recognize the isComposing flag during text input, leading to frequent and frustrating issues like premature form submissions when you hit 'Enter' to finalize an input composition.\n\nThis extension smartly intercepts these keydown events, ensuring that 'Enter' only submits forms when you're truly finished composing, not when you're midway through selecting the right characters. It's an essential fix for an overlooked problem, enhancing your typing experience and preventing common errors that disrupt your workflow.\n\nFeatures:\n\nPrevent Unwanted Submissions: Stops 'Enter' from submitting forms while you are still composing text.\nEasy Toggle Functionality: Quickly turn the extension on or off depending on your current needs, with a simple click on the extension icon.\nVisual Feedback: The icon changes color to indicate whether the extension is active or not, giving you clear, visual confirmation at a glance.\n\nIdeal for professionals, students, and anyone frequently using IME to input non-Latin characters on platforms not originally designed with these global nuances in mind. With \"Composing Keydown Handler,\" your input is exactly that—yours to control."
