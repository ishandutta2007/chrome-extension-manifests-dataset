This provides a place to ask questions about the page, discover popular pages, and be notified of activity on pages you are interested in.\n\nDoes this require an account?\nNo. Should you create one? Yes! Sidenote is completely free to use without an account. Once installing the extension, you will be able to view all available notes on their respective pages. In order to participate in the community by reacting and adding notes yourself, you will need to create an account on https://sidenoteapp.com.\n\nHow do I use it?\nOnce installed, you are going to want to \"pin\" the extension to your toolbar. This can be done by clicking the puzzle piece in the top right of the screen. The drop down will show all of your extensions, including Sidenote! Click the thumb-tack icon and that will keep it visible in your toolbar without having to open that extension menu. From there, just click on the Sidenote icon whenever you want to view or add notes!"
