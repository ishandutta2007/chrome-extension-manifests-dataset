In the unfortunate event of a breach, it facilitates compensation claims, and if you prefer to keep personal data collection and processing within a specific geolocation, Privci offers a data geofence firewall—all conveniently integrated into a single, easy-to-use personal data manager.\n\n-----------------------\n\nHow Privci Works\n\n❶ Once installed, Privci sets up standard privacy protection to guard you against online trackers and profilers.\n\n❷ As you browse the internet, it automatically checks the privacy claims of visited sites, helping you make better decisions.\n\n❸ Should you have any questions, Privci can search privacy policies to find the answers you need.\n\n❹ When you enter personal data on a site, Privci diligently tracks that site for any future breaches.\n\n❺ To further safeguard your data, it regularly scans the dark web for compromised emails and user IDs.\n\n❻ Additionally, Privci provides tools to exercise your data rights, such as data access, correction, and deletion requests.\n\n❼ It also alerts you to inactive accounts and assists in requesting their closure to reduce your digital footprint.\n\n❽ If a site with your data suffers a breach, Privci immediately notifies you. In case you're affected by the breach, it offers tools to help you request compensation.\n\n❾ To enhance security, Privci includes a data geofence firewall, limiting data processing to specific locations.\n\n❿ Finally, Privci ensures you stay on top of your exposure risk with monthly reports that provide actionable insights into your online presence.\n\n-----------------------\n\nWe hope you enjoy Privci and would like to know your thoughts.\n\nLet us know about any issues or questions you would like our extension to address by writing to us at support@privci.io.\n\nNote: This extension will send notifications to you using the Google Chrome push notification service. These notifications are necessary to communicate key findings after processing a privacy policy and will only be used for that purpose. You can manage these notifications from the extension's settings and turn them off or on at your discretion.\n\nBefore installing our extension, please make sure you read and agree to our privacy policy at https://secure.privci.com/privacy"
