So, during this period I've been taking a Harvard Computer Science Course online learning the basics of coding and programming.\n\nWeek 0 of the class we have to create a game.\n\nThat potential combined with current events spiraled into something bigger than I ever imagined. \n\nDuring the brainstorming session, my ideas evolved into concepts that would make the world a better place for everyone.\n\n After 93 hours of programming, testing, tweaking, playing, learning and being locked in the office like a young Elon Musk, I present to you MISSION COVID 19.\n\nThe principles of this game are to spread hope (share it with your friends) and it aims toward leaving you feeling like a hero.\n\nI KEPT THE CONTROLS SIMPLE:\n\nMouse: Used To Click Start\n\nSpacebar: Used To Fire Your Laser Blasters\n\nPress 1 or 2: Swap between the laser blaster (fully automatic: hold down the spacebar) and the cannon blaster (single shot: tap the spacebar) \n\nArrow Keys: Turn Left/Right using right left arrow keys,  Move Forward/Back using up and down arrow keys."
