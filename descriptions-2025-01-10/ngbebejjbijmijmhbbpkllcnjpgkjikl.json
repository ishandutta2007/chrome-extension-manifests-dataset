By selecting texts, a popup icon would appear beside your mouse pointer - when you click the icon, you'll be redirected to DeepL in a new tab.\n2. You can also select text and do the same from the context menu item.\n\n\nFeatures: \n1. One click translation.\n2. Option to disable the icon popup.\n3. Option to set a preferred language.\n4. Option to invoke the icon only when alt or option key is pressed.\n\n\nThe extension requires access to all sites in order to present the icon inside every webpage. You can disable this feature from the settings.\n\nIf you have feedback or feature request, please send me an to email dev@faisalbin.com.\nI hope this extension makes your browsing a little easier.\n\n* This extension or the developer is not affiliated with DeepL. I wanted to make this mainly for myself."
