SocialGate helps you spend less time on social media by presenting a gate on the homepage of popular websites. You'll be asked to confirm your intention to actually use the site before accessing it. This will help you break your habit of unintentionally checking in with social networks.\n\nSocial media businesses hire machine learning experts and psychologists who specialize in habit formation. The longer a user spends on their site, the more money they make. The average user cannot fight against this without help.\n\nSocialGate currently displays a gate on the homepages of the following sites: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, and Quora."
