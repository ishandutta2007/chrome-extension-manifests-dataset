For signage, office displays, metrics and more.\n\nFully new extension from original author of Revolver Tabs (200k+ users!), Ben Hedrington\n\nUpdates:\nDecember 2024 - Significant bug fixes per feedback, new icon while running per feedback, better supporting independent windows and timer consistency.\n\n---\n\ngoRotate - Tabs takes your current open tabs and rotates between each of them pausing for as many seconds as you like and continuing until you stop it. goRotate can reload the tabs on each view or not if you choose. \n\nThis was created for using Google Chrome full-screen to power unattended screens like kiosks or tv displays where rotating dynamic/live web content is needed."
