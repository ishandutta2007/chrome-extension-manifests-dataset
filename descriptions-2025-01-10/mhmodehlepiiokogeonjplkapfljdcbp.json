We have developed a browser extension that lets you scan images or texts and tell you whether something is written or taken by a human, or by a computer program.\n\nWe believe this to be a valuable tool as it can let users make better decisions as to whether they believe projects are genuine. Preventing users from buying projects where images are tempered with, or technical documentation generated by AI, can save users money.\n\nFor example, fake images from both presidential candidates have been generated by AI to tell stories that are not true. Truffle AI allows users to verify these images and thus helps with a more honest way of communication."
