The extension will look up for the highest available size of the images and videos.\n\nPinterest by default does not let you download images or videos. Inspecting the source and then downloading images can be a major pain. And this does not work for downloading videos anyway. This extension will pick out all the images and videos in a pin and let you save it to your computer. \n\nPineterest Media Downloader displays a thumbnail of each image or video found on the page, with the option to download all of them. This will make it easier to identify what you are are downloading.\n\nAll you need to do is to navigate to a pin or collection page and open the extension to download the contents. \n\nSometimes the contents wont load if the extension is opened before the page properly loads (you might see the message \"Only works on pin and collection pages!\"). In that case, just refresh the page and try again!\n\nFeatures\n1. Download pictures\n2. Download videos\n3. Download stories (both images and videos are supported)\n4. No ads\n5. Download all media as a zip\n6. Download everything from a collection (Beta)\n\nSupports almost all Pinterest domains and subdomains now. Video download works as well! \n\nDownloading all media as a zip feature has been added as well!\n\n**** Not Actively Maintained Anymore ****"
