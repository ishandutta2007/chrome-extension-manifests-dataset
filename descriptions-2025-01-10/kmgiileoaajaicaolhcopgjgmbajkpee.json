The extension can help you find the answer by searching through your emails and providing relevant information.\n\n\nUsage\n==========\n\nCompose\n=========\n\n- Open https://chat.openai.com/ and ensure you are properly logged in.\n- Go to https://mail.yahoo.com and open Compose.\n- Now type your command in the subject area eg: \"Write an email wishing merry Christmas to my boss\"\n- Hit enter while being focused on the subject. Watch the ChatGPT window pop up and provide you with the response.\n- You can ask for followup questions for the same email by typing in the text-area of the ChatGPT pop-up. eg: \"Make it more verbose\".\n\nMessage Read synopsis\n===========\n\n- Open https://chat.openai.com/ and ensure you are properly logged in.\n- Go to https://mail.yahoo.com and open any email you are interested in.\n- You should see a ChatGPTfy button on the toolbar.\n- Click on the button. This should pop-up a ChatGPT window on the right side of the screen and provide you with extraction from the email.\n- You can also ask for follow-up question for the same email by asking stuff like \"Generate a reply to this email thanking for the information\"\n\nUpdate the default query for ChatGPTfy button for MessageRead.\n=======================\n\n- The way ChatGPTfy works is that we construct a query asking ChatGPT to extract meaningful info from the text of the email body.\n- So if you wish you can change the default query to ChatGPT by doing the following\n- Tap on the extensions button next to the address bar in Chrome.\n- Now tap on the ChatGPT for Yahoo Mail\n- This will bring up a text area where you can enter your own default query eg: \"Generate a reply to this email\"\n- And then click on Update button.\n- If at anytime you wish to revert back to default, you can click the Restore to Default button\n\nImportant info/ Under the hood\n============\n- Every instance of a ChatGPT window is in its own context/ conversation. So the follow-up questions will work as long as you are in the same window.\n- The window can span multiple messages/ compose too. So you can visit a messageRead page, click on ChatGPTfy button and then if you visit compose without closing the window then the context will be retained. So if you can write a follow-up query like  Generate a response to the email and it will provide you with the response. Or you can say provide the \"ticket number\" / \" tracking number\"\n- We delete the previous response once you ask another follow up question. However if you need you can also go to https://chat.openai.com/ and see the most recent conversation and all its history.\n- Please note that in order to keep your chat history clean on OpenAI, we delete the conversation once you close the \"ChatGPT window\"\n- Some times you might face issues where there will be no response from ChatGPT. To fix it just go to https://chat.openai.com/ and log out and login again.\n- The extension is solely using client side solution and hence is more secure.\n\n\nThis is completely free and open-source (MIT license) extension. You can see the source code here https://github.com/kevin36524/ChatGPTMail/\n\nAlso I humbly thank the creators and contributors of https://github.com/wong2/chat-gpt-google-extension as this extension has been a derivative of it."
