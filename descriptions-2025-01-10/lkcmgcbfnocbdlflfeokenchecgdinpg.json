This extension can be used to filter emails from a sender with just one click of a conveniently placed link. This extension can be used with email as well as Google Calendar. \n\nEnabling this extension will make a small link appear next to the contact's name. Clicking on that link displays all past emails from that contact. Now if you receive an email and you can't remember the context, you can look up your entire conversation history with that contact with just one click."
