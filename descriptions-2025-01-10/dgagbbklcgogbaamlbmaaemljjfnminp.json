Now when you go to any page, the extension automatically replaces that address wherever it appears with the label you provided.  This makes understanding onchain activity way easier, and it works on any website and any blockchain!\n\nYou can also quickly look up any address by pressing a hotkey, and then just type part of what you're looking for.\n\nFrom the settings page you can see your whole address book in one place. To protect your privacy, it's stored locally in your browser, so it never leaves your device.  It's just plain text which is easy to edit, and you can export and import addresses from anywhere simply with copy and paste.\n\nFor maximum security, rolod0x is only enabled on a limited list of websites, but you can add extra sites if you want.\n\nTo suit everyone's tastes, there's a dark colour theme, and you can also customise the way the labels are shown on the page.\n\nFinally, rolod0x is Free and Open Source software, so anyone can help make it better.  So if you think of something which can be improved visit the GitHub project and get involved!\n\nIf you like rolod0x, please spread the word!\n\nSee https://rolod0x.io for more info, and https://github.com/rolod0x/rolod0x/releases for details about each release."
