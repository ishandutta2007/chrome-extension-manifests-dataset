This extension replaces your rating with a tier, so you can focus on your long-term skill level trends instead of watching your rating fluctuate after every game. There are currently 7 tiers, each with 4 to 5 sub-tiers.\n\n🔔 Bronze (~25% of players)\n🥄 Silver (~25% of players)\n⚜ Gold (~25% of players)\n⚔️ Platinum (~15% of players)\n💎 Diamond (~7% of players)\n👑 Champion (~3% of players)\n🔮 Legendary (~0.5% of players)\n\nYou can also turn on the \"use USCF ratings?\" setting to get a tier that is based on the Elo rating distribution of US Chess Federation players instead of the rating distribution of chess.com players.\n\nLearn more at github.com/triton11/ChessTier"
