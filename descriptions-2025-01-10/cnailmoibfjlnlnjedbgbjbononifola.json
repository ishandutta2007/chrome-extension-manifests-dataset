This allows you to continue searching under a different filter (e.g., Images) without having to switch back to it after each search.\n\nCaveats:\n• In order to use Google Search tools (e.g., calculator, unit converter, color picker, etc.), you need to switch to the All filter after you perform a search.\n• Based on the structure of Google Search URLs, searches entered directly on Google domain homepages (e.g., google.com) will not be redirected to the Web filter. If I implemented this feature, it would also redirect you back to the Web filter when you try switching to a different filter after you perform a search."
