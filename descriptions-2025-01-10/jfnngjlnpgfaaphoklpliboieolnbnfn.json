CodeBlock is an innovative chrome extension which requires the user to solve a coding challenge before granted access to a distracting site for a limited amount of time. The idea is, each unique visit to a distracting site prompts a new / novel coding challenge the user must solve. That question is saved in storage and the user may never access a distracting website until they have solved the given coding challenge. Once they solve one problem, a new problem will appear, increasing in difficulty."
