However, playback speed is limited to normal speed and 1.5x. For many students normal speed is too slow, and 1.5x is too fast. This extension lets the students control the speed with finer granularity.\n\nGo to the lecture, click on the extension icon, and drag the slider to set the speed. The extension will keep this speed every time you listen to Guo's lectures."
