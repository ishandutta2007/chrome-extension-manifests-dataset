They help your eyes stay relaxed when you have to use your computer in a low light environment. And we have an excellent Dark Mode extension for your Help Scout! \n\nHELP SCOUT DARK MODE\nDark Mode works across all parts of Help Scout. You can easily toggle the dark mode on/off in a click, and adjust brightness and contrast in the interface as you wish. The adjustments are saved automatically, and you can reset them at any time. \n\nNIGHT SHIFT\nActivate Night Shift mode to invert the blue light from the screen to a warmer tone, thus, preventing your eyes from harm. You can turn the tool on and off in a single click when you need it."
