You can also fill out timesheets, job applications, and other forms that you fill out often with just the click of a button! If you’ve ever had a oh $#@*& moment and lost everything you typed into an online form, then this extension is just for you. If not, use this extension to avoid this!\n\nCurrent features: \n* The ‘Undo’ button will restore autosaved form data for a particular site. Every change to a webpage form is stored locally on your chrome browser and can be restored through this function.\n* The ‘Save Template’ button will create a template of current site’s form data. As long as the user has ‘sync’ enabled on their chrome browser, this data will persist offline and across different devices. Note that this button will overwrite previously saved templates.\n* The ‘Restore Template’ button will retrieve the template saved to the site’s domain and fill the template data into the appropriate fields on the form. \n* The ‘Edit Templates’ button will open a new webpage with a table displaying all the user’s currently saved templates. Users can edit and delete templates from this page.\n* The ‘Clear History’ button will clear all history - templates and auto-saved data. This data cannot be recovered.\n* Works for all text elements, select drop-downs, radio buttons, and checkboxes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nNotice: This extension won't save any personal data. All data is either stored locally on your computer, or synced with your gmail account. This extension will also not save or recover any fields with the name 'Password' or anything similar.\nGit Repo: https://github.com/drewsb/FormVault"
