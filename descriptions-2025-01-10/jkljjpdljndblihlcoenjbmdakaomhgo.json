It augments Kiva's site by adding more information directly onto Kiva's site. It will talk about (yes, it can talk if you switch that on!) things it notices about your portfolio, loans, lenders, teams and partners. It will also activate existing Kiva features that are not well known and switched off by default (super graphs for teams and lenders and Kiva Live where you can watch site activity in real-time).\n\nLender/Team Pages\nWhen hovering over any link anywhere on the site that goes to a lender or team page, the extension will pull information on that lender/team and then speak some basic details if speech is on.\nWhen visiting a lender's page, instead of showing the old graphs, there are \"Super Graphs\" that display which allow for much more control over what you're seeing. Lender pages also include a link to a \"3D Wall\" visualization of any lender's portfolio.\n\nKiva Live\nThe extension will look up and speak details about each ticker item as long as there is time to do so. For example, when a lender joins a team, in addition to reading that ticker entry, given time (slow site activity), it will look up details on the team and tell you how long they've been around and how many members and loans they have. When a lender makes a loan, given time, it will look up how many loans they've made total, how long they've been on Kiva and what their top lending sectors are.\n\nChrome Omnibar\nIn Chrome's URL/Search bar, just type \"kiva cattle\" and the extension will automatically send a query for \"cattle\" to Kiva's lend tab.\nIf you type \"kiva\" and start typing another word it will also display some popular Kiva pages that you can immediately jump to.\n\nLoan Pages\nWhen viewing a fundraising loan, the Lender Assistant will make comments on things that are out of the ordinary with the loan. This includes a longer or shorter than normal repayment term (user customizable), when the rating of the partner is much higher or lower than normal, etc.\nOnce the Lender Assistant knows who you are (you just have to log in to Kiva once, it'll figure out the rest), it will be able to relate the loan you're looking at to loans in your portfolio and, for example, comment that you've made a lot of loans to that country before but they're all done paying back.\nKLA will add in the date and time (localized to your location) for when the loan posted and when it's going to expire.\nKLA has an option to always show the partner details so that you don't have to keep clicking to open the details.\nKLA will display repayment graphs and show when 50%, 75% and 100% is paid back.\n\nLend Tab\nOn Kiva's Lend Tab, the extension will add info to the Loan Cards:\n1) Final Repayment date, amount of time that is and the regularity of the repayments.\n2) Sparklines of repayment amounts. Get a quick overview of what the repayments will look like, one big repayment at the end of 4 years? Evenly distributed? \n3) The partner names.\n\nCustomize the Kiva Banner\nYou can now select a few preset options to add buttons to the top banner of the page, as well as add up to 3 of your own buttons that link to any page you want (favorite team, help, estimated repayments, another site, whatever you choose)."
