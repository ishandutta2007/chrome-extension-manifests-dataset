When recently using it for the fall quarter, I found it cumbersome to have to open a new tab and type in a professors name in order to get their ratemyprofessor scores and see the comments. While I know that extensions are available to show RMP scores directly on classes, often the best information comes from the comments. Because of this, I created an extension that automatically shows RMP links next to the professor(s) name of any class. Just click on it, and you will be lead directly to the ratemyprofessor site of the professor of the class. It is very convenient and will save you precious time!"
