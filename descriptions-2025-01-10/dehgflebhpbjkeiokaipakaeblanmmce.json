Maybe you're passively paying attention while getting some work done or catching up on the news. Suddenly, you hear your name and a question directed at you. The meeting grinds to a halt while you struggle to find the tab in the sea of 50 you have open. Finally, you find it only to start with, \"sorry I was muted.\" \n\nYea. We know. \n\nSave your colleagues from 10 seconds of uncomfortable silence."
