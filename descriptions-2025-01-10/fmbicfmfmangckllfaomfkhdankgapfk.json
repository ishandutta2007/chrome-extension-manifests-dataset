You can prepare for you dream companies and sharpen your DSA skill accordingly.\n\nHowever, since I am continuously updating company information solely, you might not get company information for every single company like you can find in leetcode premium. I collect company information from different source of the internet and update in my database. So in some cases, you might get some more company information than Leetcode provides.\n\nNow what are you waiting for? Install this add-on and boost your prep up."
