Use Canned Replies to create a set of commonly-used text snippets, and easily access these from within Gmail, or from the context menu and browser popup.\n\nFEATURES\n\nGmail-optimized experience: Use Canned Replies from within your Gmail compose window. Canned Replies adds a button into the Gmail compose toolbar so you can quickly access your messages in context to the email you’re sending. Simply click on the desired message and it’ll be inserted into the email at your cursor.\n\nContext Menu: Insert a text snippet via the context menu. Just right click (or control click) on any editable field and click the desired Canned Reply to insert it.\n\nBrowser bar popup: Canned Replies offers a popup window from your browser bar for all other use cases. Use the popup to copy the snippet onto your clipboard. This is useful if a website does not support native context menus, or if you’d like to paste your messages into an external application.\n\nVERSIONS\n\n3.0.0 – Upgrades to Chrome manifest V3 to align with Chrome's updated security practices. Also fixes the bug where the button stopped working in Gmail.\n\n2.0.0 – A revamped Canned Replies popup that includes the ability to search for your messages. Also includes bug fixes and accessibility improvements."
