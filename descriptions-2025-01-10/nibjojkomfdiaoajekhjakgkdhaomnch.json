It enables the creation and dissemination of completely distributed sites and applications that don’t rely on centralized hosting and stay true to the original vision of an open, flat web. Visit https://ipfs.tech to learn more.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Automatically use IPFS to retrieve sites, files, and other resources already stored on IPFS (including redirecting DNSLink hostnames to IPNS names via your choice of gateway)\n- Support content-addressed IPFS paths (/ipfs/) and URIs (ipfs://) in your browser, and redirect them to the gateway of your choice\n- Share files from your browser by importing them to your local IPFS node via right-click or drag-and-drop, including the option to preload files at a public gateway\n- Check gateway info and Kubo RPC status with a single click,  see how many peers Kubo RPC is connected to at a glance from your browser’s menu bar\n- Copy shareable links, snapshot links, IPNS/IPFS paths, and CIDs for IPFS-hosted sites\n- Common IPFS tasks — like pinning files and launching your IPFS Web UI dashboard — are available right in your browser\n- Options to toggle IPFS redirects globally or per website\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\n\nYou’ll need to have a local IPFS node running on your computer to enjoy all IPFS Companion's features — either from your terminal (https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/) or using the friendly, free IPFS Desktop app (https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/). \n\nMORE INFO\n\nLearn about IPFS and how it’s changing the Internet at https://ipfs.tech\nSee the IPFS Companion privacy policy at https://ipfs.tech/companion-privacy",
