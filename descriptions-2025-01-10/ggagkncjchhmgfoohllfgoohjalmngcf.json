It is not hard to slowly integrate new ideas, manipulate narratives and create online subcultures when you have access to these streams.\n\nRight now the only thing holding this back is our trust in TLS.\n\nInsidiousAI demonstrates exactly how this might look and lets you experiment with different uses for this tool.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom however, setting aside training set biases, AI can be used in real time to process the information you consume, provide insight in to areas you yourself have asked for help with, replace technical descriptions on the fly with ELI5s, explain the set of biases a text has and provide context on why a piece is highly emotive.\n\nUse it to browse websites in foreign languages while still preserving the culture.\nUse it to browse websites and understand your TikTok teen.\nUse it to familiarise yourself with a world in which you no longer can trust anything.\nUse it to censor the world around you and live in your perfect isolated thought bubble.\n\n---\n\nWe were right to be paranoid before\nWe're more right to be paranoid now\n\nDon't be part of someone elses plan, learn and grow\n\n---\n\nUsage:\n\nYou will need your own api key https://platform.openai.com/playground\nTo keep costs from ballooning and to preserve high demand inference cycles only Wikipedia and twitter have been integrated so far.\nPlease note that a few paragraphs all wikipedia pages and twitter will be sent to OpenAI for processing.\n\nEverything else is local, I look forward to the day when I can remove the api call."
