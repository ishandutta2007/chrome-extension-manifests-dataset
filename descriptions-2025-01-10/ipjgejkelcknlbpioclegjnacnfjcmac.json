Supports Google Calendar, iCal format (ICS), Office 365, Outlook and Yahoo! Calendar. Built because I am too lazy to fill in the schedule in my calendar every single year, so I was looking for a way to simplify it.\n\nActually only adds a select field to choose calendar type (ICS by default) and a small \"+\" anchor link to every concert in the schedule that allows you to add the concert to your calendar. Fills in all the details I deemed needed, but you can always edit the event in your calendar afterwards.\n\nSupports both Estonian and English versions of the schedule (based on user's preference on the website).\n\nThis is a open source extension for which you can find the original code at https://github.com/bloomlive/FolkChrome"
