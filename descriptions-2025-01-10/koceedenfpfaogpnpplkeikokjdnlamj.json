This is a dead project! It's not supported anymore, so there is no guarantee that it will work on latest browser's versions.\n\nIt is useful for developers, analysts or testers who often need to open JIRA issue using its key.\nAll you need is to describe your JIRA URL in the Options (only one time after installation) and insert key into extension filed.\n\nGetting started\nAfter extension is installed into Chrome you need to define URL of your JIRA in the Options page (Options link in the extensions page chrome://extensions/). You may define Default Project as well, if you have only one JIRA project and want to insert only numbers without project prefix.\nAfter options are saved open extension, insert key of issue (case insensitive), click Enter and extension will open required issue in new tab.\n\n* Spaces at the end and beginning of the inserted key will be trimmed\n* Skype formatting ([DATE] NAME: issue-key) will be trimmed\n\nGitLab repo: https://gitlab.com/irina-ivanova-extensions/JIRA-Issue-Opener"
