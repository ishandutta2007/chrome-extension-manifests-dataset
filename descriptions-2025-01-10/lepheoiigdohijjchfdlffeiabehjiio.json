For the user who utilize the \"Bulk Scrap Mode\" at the first time, you will receive an alert requesting you to allow the downloads of multiple files, click \"Allow\" on that alert.\n\n5) Avoid from any other activities when the scraping is in progress to prevent the plugin from malfunctioning.\n\n6) All analysis result will be downloaded automatically, refrain from using the \"Download Links\" as it is still in development process.\n\n7) You can immediately stop all scrapping processes and obtain the information scrapped by pressing the \"Stop Scrap\" button.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1) Only start the scraping process or provide the urls that has the pattern of \"https://shopee.com.my/search?**Any search Result**\" or \"https://shopee.com.my/shop/**Shop Number**/search?**Any search result**\",\nAny other url patterns might cause the plugin to malfunction.\n\n2) Feel free to contact us for any inquiry or question."
