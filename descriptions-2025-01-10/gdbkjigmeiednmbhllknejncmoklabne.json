When your target folder is selected press tab or enter to add a bookmark to it.\n\nThere are also 4 hot-keys that you can assign to folders for instant bookmark creation.\n\nFAQ\n\n1) Why does this extension ask to use my history? - History is coupled with tab access in chrome. If you view the code you'll see there's no interaction with your history whatsoever.\n\n2) Why only 4 hotkeys? - This is currently the max hotkeys allowed on a chrome extension. If there's demand, it's possible BookMap could be recreated as Chrome App to make more mapping available.\n\n3) What's next? - After some UI improvement, BookMap will be getting pop-up notifications to provide additional feedback upon creating a bookmark."
