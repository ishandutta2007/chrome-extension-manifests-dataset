A more accurate description is that it allows CatalyzeX to insert [CODE] buttons next to any papers and techniques you see directly on the webpage, whenever available. While we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre super interesting (especially as you're using CatalyzeX!), we do not have any interest in tracking what you search for, what you buy, etc. It‚Äôs just not what we do.\n\nAt CatalyzeX, we care about privacy just as much as you do. It's core to our decision-making and how we deliver your CatalyzeX experience. \n\nLearn more about CatalyzeX‚Äôs privacy policy at https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRE4yIizuRPSmDzLMRChj12HIX7ypn8qfSeYnE3WHpww2RbJD2A93MHyfdNsySHt_4UGYzFgSZ2a1CY/pub"
