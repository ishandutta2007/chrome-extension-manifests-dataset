When reading an article, all you have to do is click the Vyrtex button on your browser bar and select a collection to add it to Vyrtex!\n\nVyrtex is a social content curation platform. Quite simply, it's a place to keep up with what you've been reading in an organized, community centric way. \nFirst you create collections based on broad topics that interest you. Then, when you read something that you really like — from the New York Times, The Atlantic, or perhaps one of your favorite blogs — you add it to one if your relevant collections. Other people can follow your collections to get a constant feed of your favorite things you've read, filtered by topic."
