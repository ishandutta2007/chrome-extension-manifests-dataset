These recipes can be saved as good or bad with an easy click. Then they can be later accessed for use. There is a commenting ability that allows for notes to be made on recipes. A user is notified that they previously saved a recipe anytime that they re-access the website. This is whether they remember the website or not. This saving of recipe URLs (and comments) can be accessed on any device that someone is able to log into Google Chrome with and access the Internet.\n\nIf you are unable to receive notifications, make sure that the you have notifications allowed from Google Chrome."
