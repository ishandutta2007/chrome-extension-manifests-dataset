The official search engine is only able to search projects and studios. With the Scratch Search chrome extension, you can search those, as well as the forums, the wiki, and users! It automatically replaces the search boxes seamlessly. You can also click the icon to search Scratch, even when you're not on the website.\n\nHere, take a look for yourself on the differences in features:\n\nOfficial Scratch Engine:\npros:\n-searches projects and studios\n\ncons:\n-manual search switch\n-doesn't search forums, wiki, or user accounts\n\nScratch Search Engine:\npros:\n-powered by Google\n-searches projects, studios, forums, the wiki, and users (without manual switch)\n-works seamlessly with Scratch\n-search functionality anytime, anywhere (toolbar access)\n\ncons:\n-displays small ads\n\nIn the end, we hope this chrome extension can be used to the benefit of many Scratchers."
