Don't send typing indicators or read receipts. \n\n🤫 Don't show people you've read their message or when you're typing\n❤️ We're firm believers in data privacy and don't collect or share any data.\n💻 Free and open source. Only thirty lines of code, and easy to install yourself.\n\nBefore 😭 You have messages but don't check them, leading to long response times\nAfter 😍 Read and reply to messages as soon as you get them without pressure\n\n👋 Texting should be relaxed\nRead receipts and typing indicators optimize for engagement, not comfort. By making your actions more private, we make it easier to read and respond."
