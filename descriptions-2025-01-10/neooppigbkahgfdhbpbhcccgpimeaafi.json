Oftentimes, we just click accept to quickly get to the content. With Super Agent, you can now choose your preferences once and, for every supported website, this extension will automatically consent to your preferences for you.\n\nWe split optional cookies into three categories: Advertising, Functional and Performance.\n\nWe automatically opt out of cookies that are not clearly within any of these categories, and let you control the remaining three.\n\nRelease notes:\n\nv3.9\n- Several bug fixes."
