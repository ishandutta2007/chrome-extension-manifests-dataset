Similar to push notification format on mobile devices, the new digital tool allows content to pop-up automatically, once downloaded on the browser, and opens a direct channel of communication with audiences.\n\nThe plugin pilot was initially developed in 2020 for its group exhibition Real-Time Constraints, as a response to Covid-19 outbreak. As the digital landscape became our default experience of images and people during the pandemic, arebyte was forced into a realm which we are already accustomed with – online. As an organisation championing art and technology, we closed the doors of arebyte Gallery, but continued virtually on arebyte on Screen, honouring our commitment with artists. This led to breakthroughs and innovations with the development of arebyte Plugin, showing the breadth of possibilities when working, curating, thinking and exhibiting art online. \n\nNow in its 3rd iteration, developed and designed by London based studio 10PM the plugin will have new features including choreographed pop-up to create a screen based performance, and an archive of past projects.\n\nThe plug-in was initially developed by arebyte for Real-Time Constraints, a group exhibition in 2020\n\nCredits\n\narebyte Plugin v3.0\n\nPowered by arebyte, 2023\n\nPlugin Design and Development by 10pm Studio\n\nall rights reserved to arebyte 2023"
