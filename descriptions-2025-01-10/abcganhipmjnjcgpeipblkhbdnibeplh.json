Simply drag & drop an image in the addon (top-left corner of the interface) and then click on the - Convert to SVG - button at the bottom. The vectorized image will be rendered at the result box (top-right corner). You can also choose your desired serializing method from the drop-down list within the UI. The pre-set method is the - default - method. There are 15 other methods to choose from the list. There is also a - live preview - checkbox to make the vectorizing process on the fly. As you change any method, the result will be rendered in the top right section without pressing the convert button. Once a rasterizing process is done, the vectorized image will be displayed in the top-right corner with a download button attached to it. Click on this button to download the image to your machine. Please note that the download location is the default download folder in your browser.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/image-vectorizer.html)."
