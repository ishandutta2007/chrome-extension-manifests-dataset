Within one canvas, multiple team members can each share an application or desktop, creating a dynamic collaboration space that includes all the data and content essential to group processes. \n\nACCESS LIVE CONTENT – teams can easily pull content such as design mockups, website templates, videos, spreadsheets, charts and diagrams into creative collaboration sessions. \n\nVIEW MULTIPLE SCREEN SHARES – more than one user can share an application at once, so all the real-time information needed for team processes is available in one place.\n\nENABLE REMOTE CONTRIBUTORS – remote participants can share their screens with the rest of their teams, making it simpler to fully participate in group discussions and decision making.\n\nSHARE SPECIALIZED APPLICATIONS – content from any application can be easily viewed on the Span canvas. \n\nCAPTURE CONTENT INTO A CANVAS – anyone can take screen captures of shared applications and add them to a Span canvas. They can then be annotated, pinned, duplicated and resized.\n\nFind out how Span Workspace bridges the gap between paper and pixel, freeing groups from the limitations of typical collaboration.
