Some features:\n\n1. Redirects the OSM.org Edit button to open in Rapid\n2. Integrates Strava Heatmap overlays into Rapid (credit to the original [id-strava-heatmap extension](https://github.com/cmoffroad/id-strava-heatmap-extension) for some of the code) and lets you choose which heatmap color to use and the opacity of the heatmap.\n3. Allows you to change most Rapid default settings\n\n=== Using ===\n\nWhen installed, the plugin will show up in your toolbar somewhere (it may be hidden behind an overflow icon at first). If the plugin icon is orange, then you need to log into Strava by clicking the plugin icon. Once you're logged in to Strava, load https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap, the icon will turn pink (may need to refresh the page one time) and Strava support is enabled on the next Rapid page load.\n\nStrava cookies expire after a week, the plugin icon will turn orange again to indicate that. Going to the heatmap and refreshing the page will refresh the cookies.\n\nIf you don't want to use Strava, you can open the extension options (right click the plugin icon and click Options) and uncheck \"Enable Strava\" to hide all the Strava integration features.\n\nSee the GitHub repo for a more in-depth overview: https://github.com/emersonveenstra/rapid-power-user-extension?tab=readme-ov-file#rapid-power-user-extension"
