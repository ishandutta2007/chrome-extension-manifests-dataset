There are many trans kids out there who may be unable to change their legal name or to come out at all, and have to look at their dead name whenever they access school or medical records. Though there are already a few examples of this kind of extension available, I wanted to add in a pronoun replacement as well, which I didn't see in other extensions.\n\nUse the options page to fill out your dead name and pronouns and actual name and pronouns."
