It will only work if you navigate straight to the video from a different website/link.\n\nChange Log:\nSeptember 4th 2017:\n-Youtube recently had an update, changed fields names that are targeted to be filtered to keep up with these changes.\n\nAugust 5th 2019\n-Fixed bug where related videos wouldn't hide."
