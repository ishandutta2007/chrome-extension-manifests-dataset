Click2Dial works exclusively with the VICIDial system and utilizes its API's to allow for quick and easy 'click to dial' functionality.\n\nSetting up the functionality is easy and only requires the entry of domain and admin credentials in your ET Sniper Company profile.  User's VICIDial credentials are then added to their ET Sniper profile and you're ready to use. Users simply log in to the Cick2Dial extension using the established ET Sniper credentials, log in to a VICIDial manual campaign, and they are ready to go. \n\nThe extension's basic feature searches for the 'clicked on' phone number within the VICIDial campaign based on the campaign's manual dial setup. A typical approach would be to search all active campaign lists and all phone fields (phone_number, alt_phone, address3). In the event there are multiple lead records found with the phone number, the newest record will be automatically selected and called. If the phone number is not found, a new lead record will be created on the manual dial list you have specified for the campaign.\n\nThis basic calling feature is further enhanced by several additional options that can be set as defaults by the user in the administrative section and with some features, overridden on the Call Popup. These features function exactly as they do within VICIDial.\n\nDefaults that can be set include:\n\nPreview - Pulls up the lead in Preview Mode allowing the Agent to review before initiating the dial. \n\nDial Using In-Groups - Allows User to select an In-Group that the call will be placed through.\n\nCID Override: Setting a CID to override whatever settings would otherwise be dialing through the Campaign or as an Ingroup.\n\nDial Prefix: Used in cases where a special prefix is required to place manual dials.\n\nNote: Preview and Dial Using In-Groups appear on the Call Popup when a phone number is clicked with the default value that has been set and can be changed on the fly by the user.\n\nAdvanced Calling Feature:\nThe Click2Dial extension also includes our  'Advanced Calling Feature' that uses \"captured data\" as part of the API Calls in order to locate records within the list (using lead_id and/or vendor_lead_code) and/or update information on the lead record that is called. This feature can be used with \"CRM type\" pages where fields can be mapped using our point-and-click mapping tool, or Google spreadsheets with our built-in \"column search\" functionality that allows you to click on a number on any row and capture data on that row based on the column name.\n\n1. Locating a lead record\n\nA lead_id can be used to locate the lead record and call it with the 'clicked on' phone number regardless of whether the phone number exists within the lead record or not.  The idea here is if you are initiating a call and sending the lead_id, you are committing that the phone number should be called and associated with the sent leadi_d.  How this is handled is as follows:\n\nLead ID is found and the phone number exists within the lead (in either phone_number, alt_phone or address3. Result: The number will be called for that lead.\n\nLead ID is found and the sent number does not exist within any of the phone fields for the lead. Result: phone number will be added to the lead and called (put in alt_phone if blank; address3 if alt_phone not blank) note: If address3 <> blank, the comments field will be appended with \"C2D: Address3 value before replacement: \" [address3 contents], the number will be then written to address3 and called.\n\nThe use of vendor_lead_code as part of the capture works in the same way as lead_id, with its rules being secondary.  \n\nIf Advanced Features are used and neither the lead_id nor vendor_lead_code is used, the submitted phone number will be used to locate the lead in the same manner as the Basic Calling functionality. \n\n2. Populating the VICIDial record from the field capture\n\nIn all cases where the Advanced Calling Feature is used, the user will have the option after the call is placed, to update the Agent Screen with the captured data.  The only exception to this is the lead_id which is only used for locating leads and never for populating a lead record.\n\nTo add Click2Dial functionality to your ET Sniper subscription, contact your account rep."
