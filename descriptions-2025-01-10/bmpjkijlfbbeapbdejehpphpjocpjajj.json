The web clipper enables you to quickly capture videos, images, articles and other documents from the internet without having to log into ImpactTracker or the EvidenceVault, simply by using the browser extension.\n\nThis then saves these files into the EvidenceVault, your online scrap book for any supporting information relating to your project, with the option to associate it directly with one or more of your projects. You can later access this evidence at any time.\n\nKey Features:\n • Quickly save evidence from the internet directly into your EvidenceVault and associate it with one or more research projects.\n • Choose which audience you wish to share your evidence - or keep it private - depending on your security requirements.\n\nTo learn more about ImpactTracker, visit our product page at: https://hivve.tech/products/impactecosystem/impacttracker/"
