Typically, these alerts are displayed in the eG monitoring console, or are sent out to the configured users via email/SMS. Using the eG Alerts application, such users can receive instant notifications of problems detected by eG, without having to keep the eG monitoring console or their mailboxes open all the time! \n\nOnce installed, the eG Alerts application will operate as a Chrome plugin. With the help of the plugin, a user can connect to an eG manager's URL and login to it using their eG credentials. Thereafter, every time the eG system generates an alert, the eG Alerts application will capture the same and display it to the user either as a desktop notification or in a miniature eG Alerts window on their Chrome browser. Note that the alarm preferences set for a user in the eG Enterprise system will govern the alarms displayed for that user in the eG Alerts application as well.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat's New?\nSupports 2 Factor Authentication\nSupports SMAL \n\nNote :\nThis extension will supports >7.2.4 eG Manager"
