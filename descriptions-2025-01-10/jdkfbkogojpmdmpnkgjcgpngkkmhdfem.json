This means many comments gets removed, and it is hard to know if a question has received an answer from reading the normal comment count.\nThis add-on will show the number of top level comments that have not been removed. Comments made by moderators are also not counted. When this number is not zero, it usually means there is an answer to the question.\n\n*NOTE* This number is a reflection of the current state of the topic in question. It does NOT mean mods have approved the answer. It is possible mods have not yet seen the answer and will remove it later.\n\nIt also allows you to monitor topics to see when they will get an answer."
