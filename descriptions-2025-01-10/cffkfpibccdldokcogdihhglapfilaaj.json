This information may be saved as a CSV file, so that novice and expert performance may then be compared. The novice time divided by the expert time is the novice–expert ratio. If this ratio is above the average, it could indicate a usability issue. The user can also determine Fitts' law constants to estimate expert pointing time for different input devices."
