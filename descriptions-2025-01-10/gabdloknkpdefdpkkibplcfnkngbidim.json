The reviews section of the webstore is not a good place to leave feedback about specific issues if you would like them to be resolved.  \n\nThis extension is an incredibly simple Deluge adder that allows you to send torrent links to your Deluge server with just a click from Google's most excellent Chrome browser.\n\nWorks with link and cookie based tracker authentication and supports magnet links, which should cover every kind of tracker and torrent out there.\n\nPlease keep in mind, Deluge did not support magnet links until 1.3.3 so if you want to use this extension for adding magnet links you MUST upgrade your Deluge server.\n\nOn Github: https://github.com/sbussetti/deluge-siphon"
