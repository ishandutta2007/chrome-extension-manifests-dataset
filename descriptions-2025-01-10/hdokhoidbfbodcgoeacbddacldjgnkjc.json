For example, refresh your shopping cart over and over to get a delivery window on amazon/instacart? You should save your valuable time for something else.\n\nAuto Refresh With Notifications will help you automatically refresh on one page until \"Excludes\" contents are not shown on the page. You will be notified loudly with sounds which are set in \"Notification Text\".\n\nIn order to keep auto refreshing even you are away, please search online for how to disable your operating system's screen saver and prevent your computer from sleeping.\n\nNeed any help?\nTwitter: @LittleMelonDev"
