For the rest of the world that doesn't have Netflix Queue access. \n\n**Features**\n\n* Adds a NetflixQ button. Click that, and it will add to your list.\n* Click on the Red Star icon in your toolbar, and you will see your list of movies you want to watch.\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nJust subscribed to netflix.ca, and was browsing the movies. I couldn't find a 'digital' queue for what I wanted to watch later. Seems like an obvious feature for them to have built in, so wonder if I'm missing something obvious? \n\nIn any case, I suppose I could just bookmark the movies, but I wanted to make a chrome extension. This seemed like a simple enough use case.\n\nWho?\n----\n\nIf you have any issues or problems to report, best way is through the github repo dedicated to this extension: http://github.com/meeech/netflixq\n\nFeedback welcome through github, or via twitter: @meeech\n\nI use some icons from Circular Icons - http://prothemedesign.com/circular-icons/\n\nIn case this isn't obvious, I and this extension have no relation to Netflix."
