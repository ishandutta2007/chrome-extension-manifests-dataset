After navigating to a distracting site you will be redirected to a productive one of your choice or to our default inspiring web page that will throw motivating quotes at you. \n\nTime Snatch is lightweight, reliable and secure. It gives you the flexibility to block and manage each website individually. \n\nAny comments, suggestions and ideas are welcome! Your feedback is invaluable and the extension will evolve depending on YOUR needs. Expect frequent updates and quick responses.\n\nThe \"Read your browsing history\" permission is needed to check whether the current website you are visiting matches any of the ones you have blocked. The extension never saves, sends or uses any of this information for other purposes. You can verify this by checking the open-source code at https://github.com/Thinkorswim/time-snatch."
