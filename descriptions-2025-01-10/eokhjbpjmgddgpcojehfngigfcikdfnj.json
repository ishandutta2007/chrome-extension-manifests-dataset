Access the entire list of commands with detailed explanations by typing 'help'.\n\nMake your own commands through macros or scripts by clicking the extension icon. With macros you can store a chain of commands separated by semicolons and execute the chain with the custom command name you provide. With scripts you can go even further and write your own JavaScript for custom commands."
