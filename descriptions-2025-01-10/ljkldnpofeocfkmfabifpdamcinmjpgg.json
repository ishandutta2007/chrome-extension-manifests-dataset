Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the character: the left and right arrow keys move the character horizontally, and the up arrow key makes the character jump. The objective is to navigate the character upwards, avoiding obstacles and enemies, aiming to reach the highest point possible.\n\nGame Description\nThis game is a prototype inspired by the classic Commodore 64 game \"Nebulus\". It is built entirely using client-side JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and runs in modern web browsers. Future enhancements include additional levels, game menus, melting platforms, and elevators."
