Pusher sends notifications to a database that the user is required to setup in RestDB.io. Pusher Receiver monitors the database for new notifications and then displays them as native browser notifications. RestDB.io is also useful for maintaining user privacy. The user is asked to enter a database name and API key in Pusher Receiver settings.\n\nFirefox Version: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pusher-receiver"
