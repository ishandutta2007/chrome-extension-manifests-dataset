When you are looking at a user story or task, and want to create a branch for that task, then this extension will automaitcally name your branch!\nSo if your task has the ID '12345', and the title of your task is 'This is an AWESOME task', then when you open the create branch window, and click this extension's icon, the branch will automatically receive the name '12345_this_is_an_awesome_task'.\n\nThe extension does not use or save any data at all.\n\nIt needs to be said that I made this extension very quickly and it's quite possible that it is bugged right now. If you notice any issues, bugs or have any other feedback, please share!"
