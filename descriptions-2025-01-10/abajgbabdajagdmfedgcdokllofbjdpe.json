You can also change which clocks show for each universe (via the Options link from the Extensions tab in Chrome).\n\nThe more clocks you choose to enable, the more width is required to display them all properly (so you may need to be selective about your choice of clocks).\n\nAll clocks will sync with the Pardus server time - so even if your local computer time is not accurate, the clocks should still reflect correct timings."
