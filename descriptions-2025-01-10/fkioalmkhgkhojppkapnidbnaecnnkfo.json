This extension helps by adjusting the links to go through Put.io, to your clipboard, or to any URL you want.\n\nYou know how urls start with http:// or https://? Well, some start with `magnet:` and by default most devices do not know how to handle this. Magnet Links lets you choose how you want these urls handled.\n\nThis app is not affiliated with Put.io\n\n- - - - -\n\nHello there, for a sample for what this extension does visit this page and try to click on the URLs before using the extension and after using the extension.\nhttps://girlfriend.technology/magnet-examples/\n\nFor example, by default a Mac doesn't know what to do with a magnet link, which looks like this:\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:6H6NYFDC2NSTB5JGYHMUALXMSEALPOQY&dn=ubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso&xl=3116482560&tr=https%3A%2F%2Ftorrent.ubuntu.com%2Fannounce\n\nwhat my extension does is prefixes it with a Put.io url\n\nhttps://put.io/default/magnet?url=\n\nso that Put.io can download the file for you.\n\nSo the final URL after my script runs should look like this:\nhttps://put.io/default/magnet?url=magnet:?xt=urn:btih:6H6NYFDC2NSTB5JGYHMUALXMSEALPOQY&dn=ubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso&xl=3116482560&tr=https%3A%2F%2Ftorrent.ubuntu.com%2Fannounce\n\nand when loaded Put.io will handle the download."
