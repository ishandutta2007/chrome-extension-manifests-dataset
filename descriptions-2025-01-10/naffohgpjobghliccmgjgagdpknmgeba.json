Use this extension if you (like me), find that spending 30 vertical pixels is too much in order to support simple navigation to things that you or may not want to use (and have other easy ways to get to).  Furthermore, if you find the black bar visually jarring and distracting, and that it is essentially a continuous advertisement for Google services that you don't need to see, then this is for you.\n\nThe extension runs in the background and simply removes the black bar whenever a Google app is loaded (or refreshed). There is no visible user interface.\n\nPrivacy: This app does not access any page information of any kind - it simply runs once when the app is launched and removes the black bar - that's it."
