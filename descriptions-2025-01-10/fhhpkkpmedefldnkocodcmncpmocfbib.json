You can also use this extension to remove accounts that don't meet your criteria such as (but not limited to) matching keywords in their bio.\n\nUsage:\n1. Install the extension\n2. After installing the extension, navigate to https://x.com/home at least once. This step is crucial for the extension to initialize itself for the first time.\n3. Open the extension and click 'scan' to analyze your followers for unwanted accounts.\n4. Confirm which accounts you want to get rid of by selecting them on the left and then click the 'block' button at the top. \n5. Go grab a drink while the extension blocks all of the accounts you selected. This action can take a while depending on the amount of followers your selected and the configured timeout in the extension settings.\n\nYou can fully customize the extension to your needs by right clicking the extension icon in Chrome (or click the 3-dots menu icon if you didn't pin the extension yet) and selecting 'Options'.\n\nThe source code for this project is publicly available (GPL licensed) on GitHub: https://github.com/sleeyax/x-bot-sweeper.
