By installing this tool, you'll benefit from a range of improvements that ensure a simple, consistent and user-friendly experience across various web pages:\n\n1. Intuitive navigation: say goodbye to horizontal navigation bars. This extension transforms the navigation bar into a vertical, fixed element at the top left corner, providing a more streamlined and intuitive browsing experience.\n2. Enhanced menu accessibility: dropdown menu elements are now seamlessly integrated into the main menu by default, making navigation more straightforward and reducing the need for additional clicks.\n3. Distraction-free browsing: enjoy a focused reading experience by hiding all images on the web page, including background images. You can reveal them on hover, giving you greater control over your visual environment.\n4. Keyboard-friendly navigation: unlock the power of full keyboard navigation with a solid green frame highlighting the active element. Effortlessly navigate through your favourite websites without relying on a mouse.\n5. Optimised font settings: experience clearer and more readable text with a change in font family, size, and colour (Verdana, 16 px, dark green), ensuring enhanced visibility and comfort.\n6. Optimal text contrast: Benefit from improved text visibility with a contrast ratio of 7:1, meeting the AAA WCAG standard. This ensures that text stands out crisply against the background, catering to diverse visual needs.\n\nEmbrace a more consistent and user-friendly design across various websites with different layouts and make your browsing experience smoother and more predictable."
