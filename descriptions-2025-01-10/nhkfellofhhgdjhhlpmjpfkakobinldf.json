Once installed, the extension will automatically scan every website you visit for word pairs in the target language and swap in the translations.\n\nIf a foreign word is giving you trouble, you can easily highlight it and right-click to have the English translation listed for you. Click the word in the context menu to hear the word's pronounciation. You can also open up the extension menu to see the entire dictionary of words for that page, along with information on word gender and number. \n\nExtension settings allow you to change the density and difficulty of the foreign words used.\n\nSometimes you might want to quickly read a page in English if the foreign words are giving you trouble: simply press \"Disable Once\" in the extension's menu to switch the page back to the original English. Alternatively, if you want to prevent pages on a given website from ever being altered, just press \"Disable Domain\" in the extension menu.\n\nThe ONLY information stored by the extension is which sites you've chosen to disable it on. No ads, free forever, etc etc.\n\nLanguages supported:\n* Russian\n* Korean\n\nUPDATE (v2.0.0): updated for compatibility with Manifest v3, and added support for Korean in addition to the original Russian"
