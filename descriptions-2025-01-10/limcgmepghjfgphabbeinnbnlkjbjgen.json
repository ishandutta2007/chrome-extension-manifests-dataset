You'll see two 6x6 grids, labeled Palette A and Palette B, each containing 36 color blocks. Palette B includes 6 blocks with colors different from those in Palette A, and your mission is to find these variations.\n\nHow to Play:\n\n1. Start Finding: Click on blocks in Palette B that seem to differ in color from their counterparts in Palette A. If you're correct, the block will shrink in size to indicate it has been successfully found.\n2. Keep Track of Checks: You have a limit of 12 checks (clicks) to find all differences. Each click reduces your available checks.\n3. Watch the Timer: You have 60 seconds to complete the challenge. \n4. Win vs Fail: Tag all 6 differing blocks within the time limit and without exceeding your check limit to win. Running out of checks or time without finding all differences results in a game over.\n5. At game over, an overlay appears with a restart button. Pressing restart will create new Palette A and B for a fresh game.\n\nTips for Success:\n\n- Visual Strategy: Pay more attention to small changes in colors. Sometimes the differences are hard to see right away. Use your left checks wisely.\n- Time Management: Balance speed with accuracy. First, look over all the blocks to pick out the ones where the color seems very different.\n\nHave fun testing your perception and enhancing your ability to distinguish colors with every game!"
