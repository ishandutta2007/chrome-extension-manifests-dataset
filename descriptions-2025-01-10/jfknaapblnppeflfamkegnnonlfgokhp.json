That's no problem for Mac OS users when using\nchrome, as the keyboard shortcut for closing a tab is Cmd+w. This is a problem\nwhen using the browser on either Linux or Windows machines, as `Ctrl-w` is the\nshortcut for closing a window. So, when editing a text, a Vim user might\naccidentally close the current tab by issuing a `Ctrl-w` command, sometimes losing\nimportant text that was being edited.\n\nThat annoyance motivated people to discuss solutions on [a StackOverflow thread][1],\nin which user [`samson`][2] commented he created [a Chrome extension][3] precisely to:\n\n1. Assign `Ctrl-w` to an extension shortcut that does absolutely nothing\n2. Assign a hotkey to close the current tab (I like to use `Alt-w` to mimic Mac OS's `Cmd+w`)\n\nThe problem with his extension is that it only works with the currently active tab,\nand I regularly use `Shift + Click` to highlight a bunch of tabs, so that I can close them\nall at once. His plugin didn't support multiple highlighted tabs, so I created my own.\n\n# Usage\n\nTo use this plugin as it's intended, you have to set up the keyboard shortcuts after\ninstalling it. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` and set the following shortcuts:\n\n1. Assign `Do absolutely nothing` to `Ctrl-w`\n2. Assign `Close highlighted tabs` to `Alt-w` or any other key combination of choice\n\nThis way, `Ctrl-w` will no longer close the current tab by mistake when editing it,\nand you will be able to use `Alt-w` to close either the current of all highlighted tabs.\n\n[1]: https://superuser.com/a/1207752\n[2]: https://superuser.com/users/276658/samson\n[3]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ctrlw/goejokenmdamcapadhgghgpeeaeaaedc?hl=en"
