It's easy to use and one-click to install, so there's no need to set it up.\n\nWhat can Short Names do?\n    - The only feature Short Names have is taking the first letter in people's usernames and making that their cursor-username.\n\nIt's super simple and fixes an irritating problem when writing multiple in a document."
