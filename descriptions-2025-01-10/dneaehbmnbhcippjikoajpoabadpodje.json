Old Reddit Redirect will ensure that you always load the old (old.reddit.com) design instead.\n\nForces all reddit.com links to old.reddit.com, including navigating to the site, opening links or using old bookmarks.\n\nUnlike the account setting for turning off the design, this works regardless of whether you are logged in or not or in incognito mode.\n\nThere are also a few minor quality of life improvements:\n\n- Remove the undismissable cookie banner\n- Prevent reddit from rendering raw image URLs as HTML\n- Rewrite links to galleries to the raw old reddit comments page\n\nOld Reddit Redirect is free and open source software. The code is available at https://github.com/tom-james-watson/old-reddit-redirect. Pull requests are more than welcome."
