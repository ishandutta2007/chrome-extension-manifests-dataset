But when it’s time to retrieve that valuable note, Notion’s search doesn’t always deliver?\n\nThis extension is here to fix that! It enhances Notion’s search functionality by retrieving all relevant results, even those that Notion’s default search misses. For example, searching “15” might show you only one or two results in Notion—but with this extension, you’ll see everything related, up to 15 results or more!\n\nKey Features\n\t•\tPrecise Results: No more missed notes—find exactly what you’re looking for.\n\t•\tDirect Links: Click on a search result to jump straight to the relevant part of your Notion workspace.\n\t•\tSimple Setup: A quick guide helps you generate and use your Notion API token with ease.\n\t•\tUser-Friendly: Perfect for anyone frustrated with Notion’s search limitations.\n\nWhile it may be slower than Notion’s built-in search, the results are worth the wait.\n\nThis is just the beginning! I plan to upgrade the extension further, so feel free to leave comments or suggestions. Your feedback will help shape future versions.\n\nIf you think Notion’s search is frustrating, you’ll love this extension!"
