However, in Incognito mode, the fix only lasts until you close the window.\n\nThis extension solves the problem of Incognito NCR automatically!\n\nEach time you open a new Incognito window, the extension will automatically set the cookie responsible for the NCR setting. The cookie is received by making a request to the regular https://google.com/ncr page, and will be different in each Incognito session.\n\nNOTE: Extension has to be manually allowed in Incognito mode after installation.\n\nSee the source code on GitHub for the full code and technical explanations."
