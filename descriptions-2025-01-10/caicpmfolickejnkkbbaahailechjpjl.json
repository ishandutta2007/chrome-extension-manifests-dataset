By simply highlighting the question with your mouse, right-clicking, and selecting \"Get a response\" from the “EZ Apply with ChatGPT” option  the extension utilises the ChatGPT API to generate a response tailored to the profile of the user. This generated response is automatically copied to your clipboard, allowing you to easily paste it into the appropriate text box. \n\n- Paraphrasing: The paraphrasing feature utilises the ChatGPT API to rephrase text written by the user. This can be useful when a candidate wants to convey their ideas in a different way. To use this feature, simply highlight the desired text, right-click, and select the \"Paraphrase\" feature from the “EZ Apply with ChatGPT” option. The rephrased text will automatically replace the original text in the text box.\n\nCreators:\n- Faizan Shaikh (https://www.linkedin.com/in/faizanshaikh17/)\n- Rahul Pillai (https://linkedin.com/in/thegeekylad)\n\nThe project is open source and can be found at: https://github.com/faizan171997/ez-apply-extension."
