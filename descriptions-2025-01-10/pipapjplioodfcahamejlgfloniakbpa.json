When selecting a video from the Watch Later list YouTube will then always autoplay every subsequent video from the list. This happens because YouTube treats the Watch Later list just like any other playlist and there is no way to disable autoplay when viewing videos in a playlist.\n\nOnce installed, the extension works automatically. When you click on a video on the Watch Later list the extension will remove the playlist parameters from the video URL, allowing you to watch the video or copy the URL without the default autoplaying playlist behavior."
