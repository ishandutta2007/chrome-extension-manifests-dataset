Fear no more! \n\nWith this extension you can select from which country (usually just their warehouse) you want the product to ship and it will display all the products that match your selection.\n\n(!) Please note that this uses their system by appending shipFromCountry=CODE and therefore might not be 100% accurate.\n\nThe extension is very simplistic is should be no hassle to use. Simply search for a product on aliexpress and the special menu should pop up (surrounded by a red border)"
