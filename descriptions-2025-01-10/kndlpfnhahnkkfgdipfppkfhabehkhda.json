If you want to have this in other social media like twitter / reddit and so on, please share with me your thoughts.\n\nFacebook require us to use painful way when don't want to see something anymore, first we need to click on 3 dots, then wait for asynchronous call to Facebook server, then try to find text for unsubscribing. Sometimes it's even hidden inside a \"more options\" sections. That's a lot of work to do actually, which prevents us from filtering what we read and see. I believe that people should have control over the flow, we should be able to hide media directly from the timeline, that's why I made this extension.\n\nIt's a lightweight JQuery + small script (90Kb in total) that triggers on scroll event. That's it. Extension is not tracking anything, it's opensource, you can check it here:\nhttps://github.com/dearcj/timeline-unsubscribe"
