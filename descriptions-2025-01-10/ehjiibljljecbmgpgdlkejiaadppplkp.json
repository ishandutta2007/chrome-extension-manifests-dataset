If you're a coder, feel free to take a look at the code and locate (and maybe fix) the error if I haven't done so myself yet.\nhttps://github.com/Mahnas92/cloudsave/\n*********************************\n\nSave files to the cloud.\n\nSupports:\nGoogle Docs\nBox.net\nDropbox\nAmazon Cloud Drive\nWindows Live SkyDrive\nSugarSync\nFacebook\nPicasa\nFlickr\nMin.us\nTwitpic\n...and more...\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/antimatter15/cloudsave\nUploader's fix-code: https://github.com/Mahnas92/cloudsave\n\n\nv 1.5.1 Fixed the extension that used API not supported in Chrome versions 28.x and up.\nNote that the changelog bellow might be from different branches of the project, I just copied it from the different, already uploaded (but non-functioning and non-maintained) entries of this pluggin.\n\nV 1.4.6 fixs several bugs according to users' reviews and feedbacks, including:\n- removing the  marketing / ad replacement;\n- now you can save the .pdf pages you are browsing (works only when you use the Chrome PDF Viewer, not the Adobe PDF Plug-In);\n- minus.com works now, but Skydrive is still not ready yet, because Microsoft requires a redirect domain for a web app to use their Live connect API, but I don't have any domain right now;\n- Google drive also works.\n\n1.4.0 Various bugfixes and improvements.\n\n1.3.7 Added marketing settings toggle.\n\n1.3.2 New settings page with option to enable additional file hosts. Grouped more menu by type.\n\n1.3.0 Added support for Facebook, Amazon Cloud Drive and SugarSync. New progress bar and notification system, faster file uploads and lower CPU usage. Will now support uploading all file types to Google Docs once Google has enabled it. Notifications are automatically dismissed. Click on notification to open the file once it's been uploaded."
