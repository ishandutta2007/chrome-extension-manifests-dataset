You can ensure participants presence in google meet session without even turning their camera on. After the class, attendance can be downloaded either as a HTML sheet or as a CSV sheet. Unlike other attendance extensions NewMeet is easy to deal with. You don't have to learn any thing additional for operating the software other than google meet. HTML sheet provides a clear graphical view which makes users easy to understand participants's statistics.  Autoattendance is the key feature of NewMeet which sends a message random in every 12 minutes interval which users have to respond to increase their participation rate. This reduces excess data usage of turning video on for just viewing participant to ensure their presence. Also it's not much practical to notice all participants while we are presenting. You can also mark attendance by checking the checks shown right side of the participant id on the participants panel.\n\nWhat is New 26/6/2021*\n- Added PDF file support so that you can convert HTML sheets to PDF.\n- On closing tabs unexpectedly, creates a backup file in the download folder(won't work if browser closed forcefully due to any error)"
