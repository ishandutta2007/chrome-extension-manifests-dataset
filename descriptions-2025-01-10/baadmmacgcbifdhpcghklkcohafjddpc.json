Thus, the extension tracks all professors in each class.\n\n\n\n\n‚ùì Q&A\nQ: Is it working on other websites?\nA: No, it will only activate on the GMU Patriot web.\n\nQ: Is there any risk in using this?\nA: No, this extension does not communicate with the GMU Patriot web. It only displays information on the Patriot web data grids.\n\nQ: It is burdening for the server of Rate My Professors?\nA: Most likely, No. Theoretically, it actually uses less data than regular users. My extension saves the data for later uses, but regular users will request new data every time they use Rate My Professors.\n\nQ: Your codes suck\nA: I did my best. It is my first time making a Chrome extension.\n\nQ: Hi, I have found a bug/glitch/error/or suggestion\nA: Please, report them back to me through my email. jeongmincho@outlook.com so I can take a look!\n\n\nüìñ A little bit of the back story \n\nOld version:\nI have been thinking this idea for a while, but I hadn't been motivated enough to work on the idea until one of my teammates from PatriotHacks 2021 (which our team won! YAY! üí™) had the same idea during the brainstorming. Although our team has chosen another idea over this idea, I thought that if I had some free time in the future, I should definitely make this. Before the starting of the Fall 2021 semester, I had some free time. While I could just sit back again enjoy the summer break, I decided to make something as a side project that helps other students. Hence, this idea perfectly fits the categories.\n\nNew version:\nSince the old version has been taken down due to the usage of manifest v3, I have not paid attention much. However, some of GMU students have contacted me to get me working this one, again. I was lazy to do it, but here I am.\nI had to create the extension from the scratch due to Rate My Professor has taken down their old API and replaced to GraphQL. There were some hiccups, but I managed to create a new one.\n\n\n\nüîí Privacy Policy\nWe are not interested in collecting any personal information.\nWe believe such information is yours and yours alone.\nWe do not store or transmit your personal details.\nWe do not include any advertising or analytics software that talks to third parties.\n\n‚ùó Rate My GMU Professors DOES NOT Collect, Transmit, Distribute or Sell your data ‚ùó\n\nüìã Changelogs\nVersion 1.0.0 - Initial Release:\n* Introduced the Rate My GMU Professors extension.\n\nVersion 1.0.1:\n* Removed unnecessary user permissions to enhance security and privacy.\n* Improved error handling to provide a smoother user experience.\n\nVersion 1.0.2:\n* Addressed a reviewer request by adding a link to the Privacy Policy on the popup page in the Google Web Store.\n\nVersion 1.0.3:\n* Added support for \"Search for Classes - Classic\" on the GMU Patriot web platform.\n* Removed unused commented code to streamline the extension.\n* Included a specific GMU patriot URL for \"content_script\" to support the classic search.\n* Implemented a CSS for the classic search to facilitate future development.\n\nVersion 1.0.4:\n* Resolved an issue where the extension failed to load due to the removal of the GMU classic search.\n\nVersion 2.0.0 - Major Update:\n* Completely revamped the extension to comply with manifest v3 and utilize GraphQL for Rate My Professor data retrieval.\n\nVersion 2.1.0:\n* Fixed minor issues and optimized code to ensure compatibility across different browsers.\n\nVersion 2.2.0:\n* Added support for Firefox, expanding the extension's compatibility.\n* Extended support to include the Edge browser.\n\nVersion 2.3.0:\n* Updated the privacy policy URL to a new address.\n* Implemented scripts to build production versions of the extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers."
