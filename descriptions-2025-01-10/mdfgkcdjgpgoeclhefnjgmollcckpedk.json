Try out SHADE, your ultimate sustainable shopping companion. üåü\n\nüíª Add to Chrome: Click the button above and pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access.\n\nüîç Product Search: Instead of text-based search, use visual AI to find sustainable alternatives that match the style you're after. Simply click on an image and let SHADE do the rest.\n\nüëó Product Discovery: Browse over 70,000 sustainable pieces from brands rated 'Good' and Great' by Good On You; the world's leading source for fashion brand ratings.\n\nThis marks the initial version of SHADE!

From the founders: \"You can rock style and sustainability without compromise; numerous brands are devoted to sustainably crafting the latest-in-fashion, even in the fast fashion realm. These brands lack the resources to rival big retailers and deserve more visibility. The aim of SHADE is to get their products in front of shoppers and a fair shot at tackling greenwashing.\"\n\nDisclaimers:\n1. While we appreciate that Google warns users about how extensions work, please note that this is a standard warning. SHADE does not read and change all your data on websites. For more details on data collection and usage, refer to our privacy policy at: https://www.shadyclub.com/privacy-policy\n2. You might see a caution message when downloading the extension.
