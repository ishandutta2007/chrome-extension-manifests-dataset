Once you know the adrress of the owner, you can see all their assets.\n\n3) Why have you built this?\nThis extension was built because searching what ENS names someone holds  on Opensea is not practical. Imagine being 1-click away from seeing what your Twitter frens have.\n\n4) How do I start using the extension?\nOnce installed, it works automatically. No further configurations needed. Simply start browsing on Twitter."
