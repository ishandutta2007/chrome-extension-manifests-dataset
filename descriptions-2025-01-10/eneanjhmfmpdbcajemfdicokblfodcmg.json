Start using it by putting the keyword \"snaposint\" on your search bar.\n    2. Then, use one of our 2 search modes:\n        • By using tag (E.g. \"socialmedia\", \"map\",  \"phone\", \"plane\", \"france\" or \"imint\").\n        • By using an Indicator of compromise (E.g. Email address, Phone number, File Hash, Bitcoin/Ethereum address or Ip address).\n    3. Finally the app will suggest you the most appropriate OSINT resource among more than 200 listed. Navigate to the one that interest you and be redirected to the resource. \n\n★ RECOMMENDATIONS AND TIPS for a better experience\n    • Use arrow keys for navigation through SnapOSINT suggestions.\n    • Get tag suggestion by pressing sequentially spacebar and del keys.\n\n★ PRIVACY\nNo tracking, no advertising, and nothing else nefarious.\n\n★ ABOUT ME\nA Cybersecurity & Intelligence engineer who develops things he hopes will be useful."
