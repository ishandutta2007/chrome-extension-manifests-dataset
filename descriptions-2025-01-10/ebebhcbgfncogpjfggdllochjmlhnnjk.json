Synapse Pathology can be launched via a web route from another application such as an Electronic Medical Record (EMR), Laboratory Information System (LIS) or Advanced Visualization solution.  Synapse Pathology provides a route directly to a case or specific slide saving the Pathologist valuable time that would otherwise be spent manually searching for that case or slide.   Each time the external application attempts to launch directly to a case, a new browser tab is created.  Again, to streamline the workflow, this new tab will look to see if there is already another running instance of Synapse Pathology and simply instruct that instance to load the new case or slide.  This saves additional time by avoiding making the user reenter their credentials.  Once this new browser tab is done instructing the existing instance of Synapse Pathology, it should be closed.  While the user can do this task themselves, it is much more elegant (and time saving) if the tab could close itself.  Due to browser security limitations, this is not possible.  When this extension is installed, it will detect when these orphaned tabs are ready to be closed and close them for the user.  Beginning in Synapse Pathology v2.6, support for multiple monitors is provided with this extension.  When enabled, Synapse Pathology will launch a second screen when the user logs in."
