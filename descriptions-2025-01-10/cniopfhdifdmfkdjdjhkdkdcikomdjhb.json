This extension lets you pick a default Google account specifically for Google Meet, whether or not that is the primary Google account you are logged in to.\n\nThat allows you to have your personal account as the default account in your browser, but always open Google Meet links with your work account.\n\nUsing 'force mode', you can choose whether the extension should always override the set authUser. This is useful if you never use Google Meet in your personal account\n\nUsing the 'hide AuthUser after redirect' option, you can set the extension up to remove your authUser parameter once the meeting is loaded with your correct user. This is useful for copying & pasting the link to invite others to join, without including your authUser parameter, which won't always be the same one for others.\n\nFree and open source: https://github.com/lesiki/google-meet-default-account",
