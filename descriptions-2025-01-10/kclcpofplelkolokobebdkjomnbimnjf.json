Micah McGonigal, an American independent developer, created Baldi's Basics under the handle Mystman12. The protagonist is welcomed to class by a goofy-looking primary school instructor. The environment is bright and well-lit, and the music is upbeat. Nothing appears to be dangerous or concerning at first. However, something creepy and terrifying is going on behind the scenes. Only the most courageous people will be able to face what lies ahead. This game mimics educational games from the 1990s by using monstrous graphics and similar themes (such as Sonic's Schoolhouse, I.M. Meer, and 3D Dinosaur Adventure)."
