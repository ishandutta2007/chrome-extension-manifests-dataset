The chrome extension allows you to upload your own screenshots to Webframe to share with the community and archive for later!\n\n[Why?]\n\nWhenever I start a new project, I always look for inspiration from other sites (no point re-inventing the wheel), but getting screenshots of the internals of web apps often means you have to signup, hand over credit card details and accept being spammed forever more.\n\n[What]\n\nâœ… Browse >800 screenshots from the best designed web apps (will add more each week)\nâœ… Retina quality (with scrolling), makes it feel like youâ€™re on the original page\nâœ… View screenshots from behind signup/paywalls (i.e. no to hand over your e-mail and get spammed to oblivion ðŸ˜…)\nâœ… Save a collection of your favorite designs"
