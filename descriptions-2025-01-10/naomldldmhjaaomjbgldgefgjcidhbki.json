To unlock time-wasting websites – like Facebook, Instagram or Reddit – you have to solve Tangram puzzles.\n\nSolving puzzles takes time and will make your brain think procrastination is actually hard work. At best, you will close the tab and keep working. At worst, you have \"earned\" the reward of procrastinating for a couple of minutes.\n\nRead more on how it works at puzzleblocker.com\n\n------\n\nIf you have any issues, feel free to submit bugs or feedback through the provided tools of communication. Any feedback on the app or ideas how to improve it are greatly appreciated!\n\n------\n\nThis extension currently also works in Firefox."
