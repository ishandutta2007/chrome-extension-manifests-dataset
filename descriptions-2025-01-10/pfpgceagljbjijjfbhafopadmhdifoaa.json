That's what RandomTV does! The extension will pick a random item from any list on Trakt.\n\nYou just have to click on the Random button on the list you want a random item. Then, RandomTV will show the item in a modal, or highlight in the page or even redirect. You can set different ways to show the chosen item.\n\nRandomTV also offers one more advanced thing: in lists with more than one pages (120+ items), all the items can be choosed, even the ones not in the current page. This ocorres because we offer the API method.\n\nAPI: Uses Trakt's API to get items in lists with more than one page. Can't be used when: have filters that hide items (except \"type\" filter) or the list is private.\nLocal: Uses a script in the browser to get a item. Used when: the list have just one page, the server fails, have filters that hide items or the list is private.\n\nFeatures:\nMain\n• Pick a random item from any list on Trakt (personal lists, watchlist, recommendations);\n• Add a button on the list page which have a similar design to Trakt icons and have the tooltip when the mouse is hover, like in Trakt icons.\n\nDisplay Options\n• Display the picked item in three ways: modal (a popup with the cover and details), scroll and highlight the item in the current page and redirect to the item page;\n\nAdvanced\n• Use Trakt's API when the list have more than one page to consider all the items that the list have;\n• Disable or enable the Trakt's API method;\n• Show which method (Local or API) was used to choose the item.\n\nRandomTV is not related to Trakt and is an independent project."
