Hearing the same song or jingle over and over was driving me up a wall, so this solves that.\nSimply open up Hulu in your browser, click the extension to ensure it is loaded, and it should work immediately.\nI have tested with live TV both locally and casted to a Chromecast and it seems to work flawlessly. Please let me know of any issues you find."
