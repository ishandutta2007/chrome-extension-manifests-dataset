Got a car service coming up? Create a new account called \"Car service\" and put the date of the service in the notes to let you save towards it and make sure the money isn't accidentally used on something else. Make sure you have enough put aside for the next round of bills, or just ensure your weekend adventures don't break the budget!\n\nThis extension only requests access to the domain https://ibs.bankwest.com.au/ and only runs scripts on the account balances page.
