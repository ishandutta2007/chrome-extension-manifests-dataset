Receiving emails is easy... but keeping up? Not so much. \n\nBreef will sort your emails into bundles, so you can focus on one thing at once. \n\nAnd to help you read those emails faster, it lets you scroll them all in one go - just like Instagram or Twitter. \n\nBreef is privacy-first. You don't need to approve data access to your Gmail to use it. See https://www.getbreef.com/privacy\n\nAnd if you uninstall it, it returns Gmail to exactly how it is now. It leaves no trace."
