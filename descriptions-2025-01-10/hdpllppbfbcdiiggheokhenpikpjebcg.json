It checks hashes of content and protects users from negative updates from hackers or developers (for example, phishing attacks). For example, if you browse Uniswap and their team creates an update, the extension will notify the user about the update.\n\nSecond example — you get a link from the official channel and save it.You can open the link and be sure that the website  will not be modified.\n\nThird example — you open a new site for you and Defender gives you the info about the number of users who approved this version of site. If you make a typing mistake in the URL and get on a phishing website, you will know that this site is not using Defender or see the number of proofs for this site. You also will see the date of first proof page creation and versions list.\n\nFourth example — you simply don’t like last design update from any dapp team, and you may select last used version to browse.\n\n# Blockchain basics\nEvery time when users open new tabs or pages, our extension runs a comparisong algorithm. If a website is updated or not registered in user history, the extension sends requests to check hash with external service.\n\nExternal service tries to mine a new block of private blockchain with next algo: sha256(app sha256 + page sha256 + user address + block) and if result is less than current difficulty, new block will be mined. Average block time ~ 1min.\n\n# Reputation and reward\nEvery new block’s top 100 users by rep will get a part of 2 dUSDC in proportion to their reputation size. Also, the user who won the challenge will get 0.01 reputation point.\n\nReputation grows up when you approve new websites, and decreases when you randomly open websites without other proofs (more than 1 day after first opening) from the community."
