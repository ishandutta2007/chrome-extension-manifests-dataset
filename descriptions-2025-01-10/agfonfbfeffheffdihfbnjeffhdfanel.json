This is a technique where people work in 25-minute intervals and take short breaks in between each one. This technique is quite helpful for preventing procrastination and mental fatigue. \n\nThis extension uses a sequence of timers and notifications to help its users follow the Pomodoro Technique. Users can turn on an endless timer sequence that switches between a work timer and a break timer. Whenever a timer runs out, users are notified with a window that opens automatically.\n\nFrom the extension's pop-up, users can toggle the timer on, check the timer status, and pause or resume the timer. \n\nDuring breaks, the extension provides suggestions for what the user could do in a new tab that opens automatically when the timer runs out.\n\nWhen it's time to get to work, the user is also notified with a window that opens automatically.\n\nTo make sure users are properly alerted, a doorbell sound will play whenever a timer runs out.\n\nBreaks are 5 minutes long."
