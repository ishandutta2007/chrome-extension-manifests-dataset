Timers add urgency and accountability to async meetings. They enable you to get the best of both worlds: you and your team can do heads down work while keeping the ball moving in a timely manner.\n\nGet your point across with quick videos rather than hour-long meetings.\n\nFEATURES\n\n✨ AI Meeting Transcription & Summaries\n\n🔮 Integrates with Zoom, Google Hangouts, and Microsoft Teams\n\n🎥 Screen Recorder for async collaboration\n\n📸 Screenshot Capture & Annotations\n\n“Bubbles re-defines async work. I use Bubbles Notetaker and core product on top of all project management / productivity platforms to streamline meetings (and to have less of them) and supercharge my team's async work.”\n- Aaron Cort, former VP of Operations at ClickUp\n\nUSE CASES\n\n👉 Use AI to record, transcribe, and summarize meetings into actions. Bubbles is your home for after-meeting collaboration.\n\n👉 Connect your calendar and Bubbles Notetaker will easily hop in (or out) of meetings to securely record, transcribe, and take notes.\n\n👉 Avoid follow-up calls with rich video replies and get back to doing real work.\n\n👉 All your meetings saved in one place. Organize recordings or share folders with coworkers and guests.\n\n👉 Walk through your work using video, screen, and voice annotations without misinterpretation. Great for feedback on designs, copy, docs, and apps.\n\n👉 Stay in sync. Asynchronously. Comment at specific timestamps with text, audio, or screen recordings.\n\n👉 Share feedback visually. Asynchronously review designs, websites, and any other docs or apps. Provide context with text, video, screen, and voice annotations.\n\n👉 Resolve ad-hoc questions without meetings. No more ‘quick questions’ turned into hour-long calls. Follow up at any time and share your desired timeframe.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n1️⃣ Connect your calendar in seconds. Bubbles Notetaker will easily hop in (or out) of meetings to securely record, transcribe, and take notes so you can focus on what matters: being present.\n\n2️⃣ Get instant actions from meetings. End meetings with immediate to-do items, and a home to collaborate on that meeting’s topic and organize feedback.\n\n3️⃣ Skip your next meeting. Save live calls for only the most important discussions. Cover quick questions, ideas, and updates async with screen recordings.\n\n\"Once you use it, it’s hard to go back.\"\n- Shaan Puri, Chairman at The Milk Road\n\nBENEFITS\n\n👋 Make your meetings matter. Spend more time being present and less time taking notes.  \n\n🏠 Everything in one place. End meetings with immediate to-do items and clear next steps.\n\n✅ Async with speed.
