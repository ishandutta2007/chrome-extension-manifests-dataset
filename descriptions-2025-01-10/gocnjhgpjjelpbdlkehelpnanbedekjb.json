While this may be the last resort, more often than not we find ourselves hitting the \"snooze button\" and returning to our unhealthy browsing habits.\n\nA simple trick that works on our brain consists of turning distracting websites into grayscale (black and white). By removing the positive reinforcement played by colors on a site, we reduce the urge to keep interacting with addictive content online.\n\nBy making our interaction with distracting websites less fun, border line boring. Weâ€™re able to reintroduce intention to our browsing habits.\n\nGet your focus back! Take back control! Go Grey today!"
