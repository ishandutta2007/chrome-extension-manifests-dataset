We aim to make spending time with friends & jamming to your favourite songs as easy and inclusive as possible! However, setting up a jam session is tedious task that involves copy tabs from your favourite chord sheet sites (ie. Ultimate Guitar or Worship Together etc.) and pasting it onto Oslyn. Sweat not more! We have created a small extension to help you automatically copy / paste the chord sheet text onto the Oslyn platform. While previously, creating a song is a 20 step endeavour - now simply click \"Create\" on the extension, then review and save the song to Oslyn - its that simple!"
