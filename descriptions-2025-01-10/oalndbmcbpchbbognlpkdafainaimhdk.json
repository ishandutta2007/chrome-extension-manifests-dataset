The \"laser\" dot will follow the phone's motions. By swiping left or right on the screen it's also possible to switch slides in a presentation.\n\nIt has been tested with Google Slides, Mentimeter and Slides.com. Please reach out if you're using another tool and it doesn't work out of the box. For the mobile device it should work fine with at least Firefox and Chrome on Android and Safari on IOS."
