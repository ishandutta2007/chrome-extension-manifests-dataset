It's not until we reach the very last page of the order process that we see the full Euro value of the order with Irish VAT applied.\n\nWhat this plugin does is update each product page with the equivalent Euro price. The GBP to EUR rate is retrieved in real time from Yahoo Finance. The Irish VAT rate of 23% is included except on books which are exempt from VAT.\n\nThis extension is also available for Firefox as a Greasemonkey script http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/64262."
