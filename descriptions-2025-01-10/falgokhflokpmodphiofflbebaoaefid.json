That's why we've built this Chrome Extension on top of our existing soft-phone codebase.\n\nThis extension helps you do your work more efficiently by automatically logging your phone calls and voicemails inside your instance of Kustomer CRM. On top of that, the extension provides the ability to easily click to dial out to phone numbers on any web page! Last but not least, when an inbound call is received, this extension will automatically lookup the caller's Kustomer record and send you straight there in browser! No waiting and searching on your own."
