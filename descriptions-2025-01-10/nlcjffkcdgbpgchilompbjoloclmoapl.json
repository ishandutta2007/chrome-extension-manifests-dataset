If you are not having any livestream open the addon is sitting idle doing nothing. Feed addon some twitch livestreams.\n\n    Can I navigate to other tabs?\n\n        Yes. You just need to open livestream on twitch channel you want to get bonus points in one of the tabs. Later you can be free to roam on any other tabs.\n\n    Does it work in multiple tabs simultaneously?\n\n        Yes. this works for multiple tabs and even multiple windows. In case you want it to work in private window then please allow the permission in addons menu to do so.\n\n    Can I minimise browser window and still grind bonus points?\n\n        Yes. Bonus , you can even mute stream or tab and still grind. That green button ain't gonna miss you ;) \n\n\nNerd Note: Simply calls click event of the bonus button if available and checks again in 10 seconds.\n\nYou can reach me for any query here on telegram - https://t.me/k2here"
