Maybe your watching habit is silently stealing your precious free time from you and you could get 5-10 additional hours per week for this project you always wanted to do?\n\nWith watchlimits you can both get insights into your watching and also set the limits that will work with your life. \n\nIt's not about not watching at all, it's about not getting sucked in and watching more than you would like, losing out on sleep or opportunities to do other activities that are also important to you.\n\nFLEXIBLE LIMITS\n\nYou can easily set limits for your time on YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ and Crunchyroll. When video is not visible or not playing it doesn't count. You can allow up to 5 channels that don't count against the limits if you use them for productive purpose.\n\nIf you hit your limit, watchlimits will stop you from spending too much of your time on watching until enough time passes. There is a lot of flexibility regarding limits, you can have different limits for different days or having limits for longer period like a month or a week.\n\nWATCH STATS\n\nYou will find our more about your watching habits thanks to up to 30 days of statistic of your watching time.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nYou can decide if the limits are adjustable after they are exceeded or completely blocked. You can also password protect settings changes for an additional challenge of it you install this extension for a child."
