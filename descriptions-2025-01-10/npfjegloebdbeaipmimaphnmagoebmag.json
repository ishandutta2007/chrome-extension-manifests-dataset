When you open the popup, you can choose what language you would like to learn -- there are 38 different langauges to choose from. When you navigate to any show or movie on Netflix, the subtitles and dubbing for the chosen languages will appear if available, along with the English translation underneath. Further, when you click on a word in the subtitle, the word's definition, romanization (ex: pinyin), part of speech, and an example sentence with that word will show up. You can change the language you are trying to learn at any point using the popup. You can also turn the extension on and off with the toggle on the popup. Finally, you also use Netflix features like slowing down the video to make the learning more accessible. Happy learning!"
