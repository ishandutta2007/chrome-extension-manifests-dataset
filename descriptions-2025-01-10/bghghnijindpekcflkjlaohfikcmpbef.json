This model was integrated into a browser extension that allows the user to collect comments from the YouTube Platform. This browser extension uses the YouTube Data API to collect or scrape comments from the website which will then be fed to the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. \nThe Naive Bayes Algorithm developed was given training data that was also scraped from the website using the YouTube Data API and was taken from the videos of Popular channels such as Linus Tech Tips and PewDiePie. All these were collected, cleaned, and manually labeled as spam or ham following a set of criteria that determines what makes a spam comment. \nThis dataset was then evaluated using Evaluation Metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 Score. The dataset was made to gain a satisfying score from these metrics to get an accurate model.\n\nDeveloped by Students of Bicol University"
