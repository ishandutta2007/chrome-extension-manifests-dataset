The button appears in either the Post time or Remaining time column.\n\n• Your timer data is kept only in your browser's local storage — rather than on some server.\n\n• The extension needs permission to your \"tabs\" so that it can avoid opening multiple runTimers tabs.\n\n• You can format a timer's description by selecting its text and pressing Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I or Ctrl+U.\n\n• Unless disabled in \"Optional settings,\" runTimers will play a sound and show a desktop notification when a countdown timer ends. The runTimers tab must be opened in your browser — though the tab need not be active. By default, desktop notifications will remain open until you click on them.\n\n• You can use the Targeting tool to create a countdown timer whose duration is a projection of the length of time needed to attain a target level (at a constant hourly earn/growth rate, and net of any current level)."
