Most well-known graphene blockchains are supported out-of-the-box, including all Steem, Hive, Blurt, Whaleshares, BitShares, and EOS-based chains.  WhaleVault is also the \"key vault of choice\" for ShareBits.\n\nThe extension injects the WhaleVault API into each website's javascript context, so that any website that you authorize can safely and securely request a signature or encrypt/decrypt a memo without ever having direct access to any of your private keys.\n\nBecause it adds functionality to the normal browser context, WhaleVault requires permission to read and write any web page that wishes to access the extension. You can always \"view source\" of WhaleVault the way you would any Chrome extension, or from the official GitHub repo: https://github.com/alexpmorris/whalevault\n\nWhaleVault also offers a news/alerts feed with domain warnings for alerting users to related crypto site hacks, scams, and other potential phishing attempts.\n\nAs an additional precaution, you should only allow \"site access\" to the WhaleVault extension in Chrome for those trusted websites that require it.\n\nFor those not using Keychain, WhaleVault will also act as a polyfill for Steem Keychain, Hive Keychain, and Blurt Keychain for seamlessly and securely transacting with any app or wallet that supports them.  That includes Hive-Engine / TRIBALDEX support, all from a single extension!\n\nWhaleVault is a multi-chain fork by @alexpmorris of the Steem Keychain browser extension.  Steem Keychain (repo at https://github.com/MattyIce/steem-keychain) was originally created by @yabapmatt, developed by @stoodkev, and funded by @aggroed. Many thanks to them for creating a great template upon which to build WhaleVault!\n\nA more detailed overview of WhaleVault may be found at: https://whaleshares.io/@alexpmorris/whalevault-secure-graphene-cross-chain-key-store-extension\n\nFor the official WhaleVault Firefox Add-on, visit:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/whalevault/"
