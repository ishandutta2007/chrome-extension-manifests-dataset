Checking that is your own responsibility. Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should.\n\n\nWhat you get & Troubleshooting:\n\n • For general web pages, Mozilla's Readability.js is used to extract the content. Since that is the same software component used by Firefox to generate the Reader view, the result should generally be the same as well. All resources (e.g. images) that show up there should also be included in the ePub book. If parts of the website are missing in the book, please check whether they show up in the reader mode. If not, there is little I can change about that.\n • Books from overdrive.com are not simply downloaded, but the content is parsed from the open book. The ToC is rewritten, most of the formatting is stripped and everything gets repacked. While images are generally still included, their sizing might be off on some readers, rendering this quite useless for comics and the like.\n • If you have a problem that is not explained by the limitations above, please check for and/or open an Issue on GutHub. \n\n\n\nPermissions used:\n\n • Display notifications: Only as direct consequence of clicks on the icon or to report errors\n • Access your data for all websites: Download page content if you choose so\n • Access recently closed tabs: Remove own popups from the recently closed windows list"
