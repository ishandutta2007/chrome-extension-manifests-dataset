It allows you to store saved question templates to help build context to your questions. For example, a question template could be:  Give me a response in a complete sentence and explain it like I am only 10 years old ?newQuestion. A question mark followed by a variable name is what will be filled in later which in this case is a new question. So with this template, we would just have to plug in our new question and the template would already have the context to ask for a complete sentence and to explain it to you. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/column\" title=\"column icons\">Column icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>"
