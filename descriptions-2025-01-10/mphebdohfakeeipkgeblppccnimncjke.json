I surely have.\n\nI made this little extension to help in this matter, by allowing you to hide car ads that you don't like and which keep showing up throughout different searches. \n\nAfter you install it, you'll notice a blue button on every ad in the results list. Click this button to make the ad go away. This will get saved to your browser, so next time you come searching for cars, you won't have to go through all those ads you've already seen.\n\nNotes: \n- The extension works best for the Deutsch and English versions of the website.\n- Hidden ads can be recovered by clicking the \"Add back\" link.\n- Hidden ads will be remembered only on the computer you're using. They do not sync between all your devices... yet :)\n\nI hope this will help you find your dream car faster. Feedback is appreciated!"
