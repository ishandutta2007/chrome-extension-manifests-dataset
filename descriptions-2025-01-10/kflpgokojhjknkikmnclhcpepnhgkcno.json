From there you can adjust your annotations and auto-play through steps in the flow that don't need to be explained.\n\nOnce you've finished editing, you can publish your demonstration which lets you share the annotated recording with the world. üåè\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Call-to-Action: Close more deals! ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nAn important element to any marketing funnel is making sure you deliver a call-to-action at the right time. \n\nWith HowdyGo, you can easily configure a CTA that displays to your most engaged viewers. Allowing you to link out to any website and close more deals.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è What happens to my images, videos, styles, fonts, etc? ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nAs you record, we perform some magic in the background which stores every image, video, style, font and asset that gets displayed in your recording.\n\nWe store these files in a lightning-fast cache which lets us replay a perfect snapshot of your website at that point in time. Even if those files, or your app changes in the background, we will still be able to replay your recording perfectly."
