To make it easier to access in the future, \"pin\" the extension!\n\nTo share listings, open the extension and click \"Share Listings\". Sharon automatically shares the available items on the page to your followers. When she's done, she starts the cycle over again. You can sit back, relax, and let Sharon do the work!\n\nDone sharing? Open the extension and click \"Stop Sharing\".\n\nSharon shares listings about every 10 seconds, which avoids triggering CAPTCHAS. Slow and steady wins the race. Selling on Poshmark is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nNotes:\n- You can run Sharon on any closet, party, or \"brand\" page.\n- If you don't scroll down, Sharon shares the top 47 items on the page. For best results, scroll down as far as you want Sharon to share, and *then* click \"Share Listings\". \n- This is a \"no frills\" extension. Sharon shares, but she doesn't follow, offer, solve CAPTCHAs, or any of that fancy stuff. At least not yet.\n- Sharon is FREE...for now! \n\nSo what are you waiting for? Download Sharon and share on!\n\nDisclaimer: The \"Sharon Poshmark\" extension and its creators are not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or otherwise related to Poshmark, Inc. or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries. \"Poshmark\" is a trademark of Poshmark, Inc."
