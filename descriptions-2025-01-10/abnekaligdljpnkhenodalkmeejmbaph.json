In this way, you can review, edit, document, and continue searches much more efficiently than the standard search history and bookmarks.  Separate searches can be saved and documented under different search names - and saved to a PDF file with live links for documentation.\n\nIf you are frequently frustrated when doing extended Google searches - emailing yourself links, making a document of notes off to the side, saving items to a note taking app, and trying to keep track of bookmarks, Search Assist can help you out. The work was motivated by my daughter's research during her PhD. Like me, she needed a better tool to document her searches. I hope you find it helpful! Enjoy!"
