You can change the sliders to find the right offer price.\n5) If you like the numbers, you can add the property to your funnel, by copying the values and pasting them in an excel.\n\n\nWhat problem are we solving?\nI had filters setup on Zillow, Redfin and Realtor to notify me of any new listing in my market. I would get tens of emails everyday and then I would use my excel calculator to analyze them, which was a tedious process of going back and forth and pasting values from the listing to excel model. On average I spent hours every week doing this.\n\nNow I spend 5 minutes a day and its so much more fun. Because it is fun, I do more analysis and I am able to find better deals and move fast on them also.\n\nHope this helps!"
