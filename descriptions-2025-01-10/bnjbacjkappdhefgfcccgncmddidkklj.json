You're not alone! The algorithm tends to suggest videos based on your clicks, which often rely on view counts and likes. What if we could blind these metrics and uncover hidden gems while clearing our \"watch later\" list?\n\nThatâ€™s why I created this small Chrome extension! Iâ€™ve been using it for a while, and it works wonders!\n\nWhat It Does:\n\n1. Hide View Counts and Likes: Enjoy a distraction-free browsing experience without the influence of view counts or likes.\n2. Explore New Channels: Discover valuable channels that you might not have noticed before.\nJoin the Community! If you face similar issues or just want to try something new, please install the extension!\n\nIâ€™ve also created a public Google Sheet where you can add channels you discover while using YouTube in blind mode. Feel free to edit and share your finds with others!\n\nGoogle Sheet: https://shorturl.at/KyPzW\n\nHappy exploring! ðŸŒŸ"
