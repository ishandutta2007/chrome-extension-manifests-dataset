Just turn on soundfilter and they'll be removed for you.  Click the icon up in the top right of the browser to toggle soundfilter on and off.  That's pretty much it.\n\n\nFuture Enhancements\n\n- Find a way to actually alter requests so that reposts are never requested in the first place... As it stands, the extension is just removing reposts as they come in, so they are still being downloaded - which makes it much slower than it could be but I'm just not sure how to filter out reposts from the beginning.\n\n-Skip reposts in autoplay.  Soundcloud makes your autoplay playlist behind the scenes, so even though they are being deleted from the page, they will still be played in autoplay."
