Just type the \"v\" letter following by a space, then type your search.\n- v3.0+ no longer works with IBM Verse (only compatible with HCL Verse)\n- v3.0+ no longer provide SSO feature for IBMers (aka w3id)\n\nUpdate 3.1 : \n- Introducing the new MiniVerse feature : quickly access to your latest emails or the incoming meeting, without leaving the current tab ! Double-Click on the extension button to bring Verse to front as before. You can also disable the feature from the Settings page.\n\nUpdate 3.0.1 : \n- fixing bug with some meetings notifications which weren't displayed.\n- adding a small feature in the Options page to the reset inbox's unread counter (which was stuck to 999+ after the migration of my IBM mailbox to HCL cloud, I assume I'm not the only one)\n\n\n===============================\nImportant disclaimer : this extension has not been developed by HCL and is not supported by HCL.  \n==============================="
