I spend many hours at my computer, and although I love my job this sedentary lifestyle gets to me.  I've been using Pomodoro timers for some time and I thought it might be a good idea to mix mini exercise routines into the Pomodoro breaks. \n\nThis is good for the body, helps with posture, and gets the blood flowing. It can only be a good thing for work.  This is a VERY early draft for what I have in mind, but I hope you'll find it useful."
