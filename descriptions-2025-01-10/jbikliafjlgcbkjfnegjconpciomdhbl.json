Imagine if you actually disliked being distracted?\n\n\nDesigners have figured out how to tap into our basic instincts to keep us clicking. Fight back on a primordial level.\n\nBy assigning a small cost to time on the web, the attractiveness of the daily flood of distractions is undermined by one of your brain's most powerful heuristics: loss aversion. Loss aversion is so powerful that it doesn't take much to trigger it; even a few cents per minute is usually enough.\n\nFlow Cow reinforces your online behavior immediately and continuously; wasted time is always on the clock. Productivity is boosted instantly and only improves as your brain eventually forgets about distracting sites completely.\n\nChange the way you see the web."
