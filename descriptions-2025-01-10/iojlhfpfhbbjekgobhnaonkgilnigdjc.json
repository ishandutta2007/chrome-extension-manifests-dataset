Balls of various random colors will continuously fall from the top of the screen, and your goal is to defend the color ring at the bottom. This unique ring is made up of three layers with distinct colors: Red (outer), Orange (middle), and Blue (inner). \n\nHow to Play?\n\n1) Adjust the ring's color by clicking on it. Each click removes one layer from the outside, shifting the current outer color inward. When only the innermost layer remains, clicking again will add layers back from inner to outer, allowing you to cycle through the color sequence.\n\n2) Absorb falling balls that match the current outer ring color to earn points. But be carefulâ€”if a ball's color doesn't match the ring's outer layer, the game is over!\n\n3) The highest score achieved in past games will be displayed at the top of the game interface.\n  \nStrategy:\n\n- Master the art of quickly rotating the ring's layers to match the incoming ball's color.\n- Plan ahead and anticipate which color will come next to maximize your score.\n\nTest your reflexes and see how long you can survive in this addictive, color-matching challenge!"
