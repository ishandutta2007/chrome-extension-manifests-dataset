It's like bookmarks, but really fast.\n\nJump lets you register URLs with keywords that you choose. You can then navigate to those keywords by:\n- Typing \"j\", followed by space, in the address bar to activate the jump extension\n- Typing the keyword\n- Hitting enter\n\nYou don't even have to type the full keyword!\n\nNavigating to a site BEFORE jump:\n\nStart typing part of the URL until you see it pop up in the suggestions. Scroll down to the suggestion using the arrow keys. Hit enter. Lots of keypresses, lots of cognitive overhead.\n\nNavigating to a site WITH jump:\n\nThink: \"jump to site\". Type \"j\" for jump, space for to, and the first character of the site. Hit enter. Three keypresses, intuitive process.\n\nCongratulations! You are now speed."
