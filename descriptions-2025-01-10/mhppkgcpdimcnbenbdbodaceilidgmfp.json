That's why the extension icon turns red.\n\n\n\nGeneral Information:\n\nMany websites set to display Mac fonts like Helvetica and Helvetica Neue for their content as default. Windows doesnâ€™t have any of them, so it will try to display another fonts instead. The bad part is, it selects the not-so-good ones for substitution.\n\nThis extension will do the fonts replacements in the background one-by-one. It's supposed to make web pages look a lot better in Windows system. The example ones are GMail Inbox, many subreddits, BBC, JIRA, and many more.\n\nWhat makes this extension special is the way it replaces fonts. The other extensions will replace ALL the fonts on the page with the ONE font you configure, so the page displays with that one font.\n\nOn the other hand, this extension will replace just the fonts in the 'ugly' list with the better ones from their families. The fonts are embedded so no additional internet request is made.\n\nPlease report any issues you found, it would be much appreciated."
