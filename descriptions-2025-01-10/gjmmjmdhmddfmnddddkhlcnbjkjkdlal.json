The most frequent sender is shown at the top of your inbox, to the right of the search bar. Note that this is only taking into account the current page, not the complete inbox. If this extension gets more popular, I might find time to build more features into it.\n\nIf you'd like to see the code, or file feature requests - please do so at https://github.com/ubershmekel/gmail-analytics"
