Say goodbye to dryness, itchiness, and tired eyes.\n\nDARK THEME FOR SERVICENOW \nThe extension will invert the color of the ServiceNow UI to black, as well as alter the text color to make it easy to read on a dark background. Therefore, you wonâ€™t have to strain your eyes when working in a room with poor lighting. \n\nWe also added advanced settings so you could adjust contrast and brightness levels.\n\nNIGHT SHIFT MODE\nProlonged exposure to blue light is extremely harmful to the eyes as well as your sleep. However, you can reduce its effect with the Night Shift feature. The extension will change the light from cold to warm, making it softer and a bit dimmer.\n\nNight Shift is optional. You can switch it on and off when necessary."
