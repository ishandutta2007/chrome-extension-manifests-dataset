The generated image is injected with useful metadata (namely, the TeX code for screen reader compatibility) then automatically copied to the clipboard for pasting anywhere that images (or their source attributes) are supported.\n\nIn Google Docs and Slides, double-double clicking an existing TeX Math Here creation will copy the TeX code to the popup for its next instance.\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut To Launch\nWindows: Ctrl+Shift+Y\nLinux: Ctrl+Shift+U\nMac: Command+Shift+Y\nChromeOS: Ctrl+Shift+U\n\n\nv0.7 Changelog:\n - Modified the list of available fonts, losing Comic Sans and Verdana, but gaining compatibility (through open source versions) with Bookman, Euler, Garamond, New Century Schoolbook, Palatino, STIX 2, Times New Roman, and Utopia\n - Added support for full 24-bit color\n - Added support for pulling code from TeX Math Here creations in GMail\n - Eliminated usage of a third party image renderer"
