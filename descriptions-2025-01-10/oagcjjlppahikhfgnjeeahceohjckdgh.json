As a user moves from one tab to another, the smart timers automatically pause and re-start so that only one timer is running at one time.\n\nOnce they have completed their work, the Browser extension automatically creates Activities in the user's DayBook, which can then be converted into Time entries with a couple of clicks.\n\nSecurity and Access to the Server is controlled by the employing Firm, and the data is only accessible by the user and that employer Firm."
