It's a file system for your web browser. It provides a works pace for hierarchical organization of all of your web resources, just like your local finder helps organize your files. Folders and sub-Folders are fully functional.\n\nThis extension also provides a special feature: a reading queue which stores resources of your choice in the order in which you come across them. When browsing the web, store interesting documents and pages that you don't have time for immediately into the queue, and revisit them later. Once you visit a page from your queue, it's out of your reading list (unless of course you choose to save it permanently)."
