Filter through posted content.\n\nZelos is a chrome extension that runs in the background and blocks out \"Promoted\" posts on LinkedIn. 1 in 10 posts on the LinkedIn feed are \"promoted,\" and these posts distract the user from other opportunities on LinkedIn. We are providing a free service to remove these posts for the user. \n\nNot only does Zelos filter out promoted posts. But Zelos provides a widget for the user to view the total number of promoted posts blocked on LinkedIn. This widget helps the user gauge the effectiveness of the tool.\n\nVersion 1.0\n- LinkedIn filter for \"Promoted\" posts.\n- Zelos widget for keeping track of total number of posts blocked.\n\nFuture Updates\n- Automatic categorization of posts on LinkedIn.\n- Premium feature to filter out posts by Celebratory, Opinion, Opportunity, Storytime, etc.\n\nPermissions:\n- storage: required for communicating to the widget the number of blocked posts from the script that is blocking posts on LinkedIn."
