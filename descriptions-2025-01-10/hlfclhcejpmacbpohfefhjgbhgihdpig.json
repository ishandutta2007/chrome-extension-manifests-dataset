We make the prices transparent when browsing and viewing wine from winebid.com before you place your bid!\n\nNormally you wouldn't see winebid.com's markup until right before you placed the bid. It makes it very hard to browse and know exactly how much you would actually be bidding. This extension alleviates that and changes the price right on the listings page when searching for wine, and on the individual wine page when you adjust your bid. This extension will make sure you know the total cost without going through the multi-step process of confirming a bid.\n\nOnce you install the extension, all the listings and your bidding will display the price you'll pay after winebid.com's 17% markup. It allows easier browsing and quicker decision making about the wines you want without breaking out your calculator to determine if the pricing is market value."
