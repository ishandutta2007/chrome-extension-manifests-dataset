For example, you can specify spending a max of 30 minutes per day on www.facebook.com, and then it will block you from going on the website after you've used it for 30 minutes until the day is over! Users can specify a list of websites that they want to limit, and can add and delete websites, flexibly change the amount of time. The extension also provides the user with the amount of time remaining for the website, so you can see how much time you've spent on the website today and how much time you have left. Note: URL blocking is matched so that if you enter www.facebook.com, timelimit will block www.facebook.com/profile/:id, www.facebook.com/pages, or anything else matching www.facebook.com/*."
