It can:\n-Visually minimize reposts on the Stream page\n-Suggest tracks from any user's Likes or Tracks page or any Playlist page based on number of likes, plays, and other metrics\n-Sort the user's own likes by date\n-Back up the metadata of the user's own likes or a playlist in JSON format.\n\nGo to a soundcloud.com webpage and click on the extension button to hide or show the Filter button, get track suggestions, sort tracks, or access backups.\n\nAt the moment, OrangeCloud Enhancer's algorithms heavily favor new tracks when making suggestions. This may be changed in later releases. Some tracks are not available for playback, sorting, or backup through OrangeCloud Enhancer. This seems to be due to limitations in the SoundCloud API."
