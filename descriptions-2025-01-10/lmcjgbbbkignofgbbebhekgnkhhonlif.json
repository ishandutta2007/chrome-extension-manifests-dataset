But what if that didn't have to be true? This addon adds lightweight interactive graphs to popular Cricket statistics website espncricinfo.com to help you make sense of difficult to understand statistics that would otherwise be numbers in a table.\n\nFeatures:\nCurrently, visualisations support a range of player statistics such as Runs scored, Averages and Strikerates on a range of different groupings including Venue, By Year and Continent. \n\nOnce installed, visualisations are added to pages with a URL like:\n- www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/[player-id]/bowling-batting-stats. Such as: https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/joe-root-303669/bowling-batting-stats will give show the graphs shown above.\n- many more to come\n\nFor issues, feedback and source code: https://github.com/rv3392/cricinfo-tweaks"
