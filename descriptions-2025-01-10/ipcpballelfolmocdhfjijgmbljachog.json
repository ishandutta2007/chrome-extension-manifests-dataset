It adds a button to the headlines on these sites. When clicked, this button will show all recent changes to the title of this article.\n\n'History' logo by Sugeng Santoso\n\nQ: Why does Chrome say this extension needs to read my browser history?\nA: The 'tabs' permission is required for the popup to know which website you're looking at, so that it can tell whether the OpenTitles API is already tracking that website or not. This is the only part of the tabs API that is used by this plugin, it does not actually read your browser history (you may verify this by viewing OpenTitlesMainScript.js in your installation)."
