This makes payment processing effortless, instantaneous, and aligned with current workflows.  LPA Synapse directly addresses longstanding industry challenges, setting a new standard for integrated payments processing.\n\nThe introduction of LPA Synapse is timely, as dental practices increasingly demand robust and efficient integrated solutions which do not require staff to leave their practice management software to complete transactions. Supporting features like “Zero-click” payments, secure card-on-file capabilities, and mobile/NFC payment acceptance, LPA Synapse ensures a streamlined payment experience without any disruption to the practice's workflow. This has been a critical limitation with previous technologies, which LPA Synapse now overcomes.\n\nFurthermore, with LPA Synapse practices can enjoy the convenience of using mobile, WiFi/wireless POS terminals, and still experience workflow-efficient payments integration, all within their existing practice management systems."
