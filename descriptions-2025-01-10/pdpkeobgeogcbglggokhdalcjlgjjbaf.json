Images that tell us what’s going on in the world. They broaden our world by providing information that we can’t get in any other way.\n\nYet this presentation can quickly cause a disconnection between reality and the representation of our worldview. We learn\nto link news / events / situations to images. Like a machine, we automatically make connections between language and images. However, these do not always correspond to the reality.\n\nBy offering a plug-in, for news sites, I provide the news readers with a new connection between language and images. It questions the disconnection that the news creates with reality. I want people to think critically about their current worldview and let them dwell on the information they receive daily."
