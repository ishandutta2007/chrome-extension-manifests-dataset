You’ll be able to answer questions like how long can you stay focused? What time during the day are you most productive? How often are you distracted? All so you can devise the best time management plan that fits you most naturally, without effort.\n\nYou just read an article on a new productivity plan and swear you will follow it. Next thing you know, you’re back to your old habits a week later. Even if you stick with it this week, can you keep doing it for months? Developing new habits are hard because you have to force yourself. If you know your natural limits, like how long you can stay focus, the exact hour you are most productive, or the sites that distracts your flow – developing new habits around your natural state would come easy.\n\nTime Tracker helps you learn more about yourself – so you can become better at adapting to work patterns that best suit you, naturally. Uncover the sites that are consuming your time and become aware of them; Figure out how long you can be in that serious work state, so you can take breaks naturally; Discover time periods you are most distracted—and do a mood-changing activity instead. When you adapted a new pattern, verify your progress week by week with qualitative, numerical evidence. \n\nHow do we do this? By using data and graph visualizations. Take advantage of all of our charts by opening “stats” tab or open options page and navigate to each section.\n\nOur charts on each section can answer these questions for you:\n\nDashboard – Which sites eats your time? What % of time every day & week is spent on this site? Which days in a week are you online the most? Did you spend more time online this week or last week?\n\nWatch sites overview – Did you reduce total watch sites usage this week? Which sites improved? How much did they improve? \n\nWatch sites details – when do you visit these watch sites? What time do you visit them? For how long? How long between each visit? How many times do you visit in a day?\n\nUsage Pattern – What is every site you visit in a day, hour by hour? How was it different from yesterday, or last week? \n\nIf you had $86400, and you had to spend everything by the end of the day or it’s gone, will you waste a single dollar? Then why would you waste any of your precious 86400 seconds every day, when it can’t even be earned back? Our time is limited, so we must use it wisely.
