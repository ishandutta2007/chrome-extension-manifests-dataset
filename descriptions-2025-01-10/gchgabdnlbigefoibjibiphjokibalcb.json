While you can add the extension to Chrome, you'll need to purchase a license via the link provided in the extension's popup to access the results.\n\nParasite SEO Wizard\n\nParasite SEO Wizard helps you identify \"Parasite\" sites in Google search results. Parasite sites are websites that rank in search results primarily by leveraging high authority platforms or exact match keywords to gain visibility. These sites often crowd out organic content with less relevant or low-value information, impacting the quality of search results.\n\nTo help you easily spot these parasite sites, Parasite SEO Wizard adds highlighted information to each search result from a recognized parasite site. Each highlight displays three pieces of information in a rectangular box: the domain name of the parasite site, its position in Google’s organic search results, and its parasite site type.\n\nParasite SEO Wizard identifies over 200 free parasite sites and more than 500 paid parasite sites. It also detects marketplaces acting as parasite sites, YouTube videos used as parasite sites, and exact match domains (sites where the domain name exactly matches your search keyword).\n\nAll enhanced results shown on the Google search page can also be accessed within the extension popup. Each search result with a highlight in Google will also appear in a table in the popup.\n\nFor each record, the table will display:\n\nThe entered keyword (Field: \"Keyword\")\nThe parasite site’s position in the search results (Field: \"Position\")\nThe domain name of the parasite site (Field: \"Domain\")\nThe parasite site category (Field: \"Category\")\nThe page URL of the parasite site (Field: \"URL\")\nAbove the table of identified parasite sites, the popup also displays summary information by parasite site category. For each of the 5 parasite site categories, the popup shows:\n\nThe number of parasite sites in that category (Field: \"Total\")\nThe best search position for a parasite site in that category for the keyword (Field: \"Best Position\")\nAll table content can be copied to the clipboard using the \"Copy Table\" button located below the table in the popup.\n\nThe popup also enables license key management with:\n\nA field to enter the license key (Field: \"Enter Licence Number\")\nAn \"Activate Licence\" button to activate the entered license\nA \"Deactivate Licence\" button to disable the license\nA \"Buy Licence\" button to open the license purchase page"
