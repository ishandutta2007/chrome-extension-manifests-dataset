This extension acts on the final checkout page of any website, and pops up so that it seems like just another way to finish your order, but really we close it all out entirely. Hence, you \"feel\" like you purchased what you want, but you never actually did. We hope this helps promote positive change in online shopping and a more minimal and thoughtful consumer lifestyle."
