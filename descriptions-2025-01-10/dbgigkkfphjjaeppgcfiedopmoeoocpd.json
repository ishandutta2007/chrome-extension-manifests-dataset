Each class has their own separate and private chat room that is only accessible by students in that class. Yogurt is a dynamic and comfortable way to ask and express feelings in class!\n\nUsing it is simple -- Just log into your cTools account, navigate to the particular class page and open Yogurt out of your google chrome extensions bar. You will instantly be given access to a completely anonymous and secure chat box. \n\nWhether you want to share notes with others in class, ask questions among your peers, or even just talk about Michigan Football, Yogurt is perfect for you!"
