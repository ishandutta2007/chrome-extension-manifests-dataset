Not even by Google (the owner of data). So I made this for my personal use; thought somebody else might find it useful so I shared it. You are more than welcome to contribute by suggesting code, sending feedback and etc.\n\nThis tool does not require any special permissions or something like that. No data would be collected from you by the extension. Use it freely.\n\nThe code could not be any simpler than this. What this tool does is just connecting you to \"Google Ngram Viewer\", which is a tool to see how the use of the given word has increased or decreased in the past. As someone who speaks English as the second language, my personal purpose of using Ngrams has been checking the new words I'm learning. Sometimes words become obsolete rapidly; in such cases, to have a better word choice it's better to use a Synonym.\n\nThe shortcut key of the tool is Alt+N. When you opened it, type in the word (you can also type word combinations and names) then press Enter.\n\n***********************************************************\nQuoting from Google Ngram Viewer's FAQ:\n\n\"I'm writing a paper based on your results. How can I cite your work?\nIf you're going to use this data for an academic publication, please cite the original paper:\n\nJean-Baptiste Michel*, Yuan Kui Shen, Aviva Presser Aiden, Adrian Veres, Matthew K.
