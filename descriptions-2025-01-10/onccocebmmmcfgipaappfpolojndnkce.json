(https://blog.disqus.com/bringing-back-downvotes) This extension is now obsolete. But... who knows how things will change again, eh?\n\n---\n\nORIGINAL:\n\nLess than a month ago, Disqus has decided to hide the downvote counters of its comments. Less than a day ago, I have learned that the number of downvotes is still kept in a classname property. This extension simply displays that information.\n\nHowever, unlike upvotes, the classname does not seem to be updated automatically. It is possible that this extension may not work in time, without any alternatives. Hopefully, this will become obsolete.\n\nMarch 12th, 2014\nSeoul"
