Advertising. Currently, advertising earns Google over $30bn every year.\n\nHow does it work? Ads Fund sells its own adverts, dedicating 50% of profits to fund work to allow the most people to live longer who would otherwise die not by choice or neglect. If a person has the Ads Fund extension installed, when they are using Google, Twitter, or Youtube, Ads Fund's ads might be inserted.\n\nThe 'golden' button allows access to the central ad list that everyone can see without having to search or use one of the other supported services.\n\nIt's early in Ads Fund's history. But already, Ads Fund has over 70 users per day from over 20 different countries, and over 1200 total downloads of the extensions. Downloads continue, and you can help too.\n\nOpt-in, and keep the add-on installed to show advertisers you want to see ads!\n\nPROMOTION: FREE advertising credit is available inside the extension.\n\nAlso available for Firefox.\n\nLearn more at the Ads Fund website: http://www.adsfund.org"
