Simply click the Web Wellbeing icon to the right of the address bar to view a page's wellbeing rating.\n\nWeb Wellbeing takes the text displayed on a website and rates it based on the five areas of wellbeing, called PERMA. PERMA stands for Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment. These are the five components of psychological wellbeing. Each has a negative counterpart which Web Wellbeing also rates: negative emotion, disengagement, negative relationships, lack of meaning, and lack of accomplishment.\n\nBy keeping track of the language used on the sites you visit, you can make more informed and mindful choices about your browsing habits.\n\nWeb Wellbeing can also redact overly negative sections of websites, or block them all together. The extension comes with a range of customisable options.\n\nInstall Web Wellbeing today and take control of your wellbeing online!"
