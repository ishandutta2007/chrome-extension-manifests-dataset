It seems simple enough to close my tabs for sites like Facebook, but then I follow a link to some Facebook content and before I realize it I'm debating American gun policy for the next hour. To make matters worse, Google+ distracts me with notifications even when I'm just trying to search the web. Focused makes it easy to block out those sites while you do what you really want to do. If you want to take a short break, just unlock the tab and Focused will shut it automatically in 5 minutes."
