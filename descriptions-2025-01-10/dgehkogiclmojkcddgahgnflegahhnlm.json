Click the extension and all default segments will open in new tabs.\n\nQ: What's the point of this?\nA: Optimizely segments are selected via a dropdown menu with a check box. After selecting, the user has to click update, and the page takes a significant amount of time to load. The UI doesn't allow opening segments in multiple tabs either. When selecting a segment, and parameter is appended into the URL. For example, this parameter '&segmentCondition=JTVCJTIyYW5kJTIyJTJDJTdCJTIyc2VnbWVudF9pZCUyMiUzQTEwMCUyQyUyMnZhbHVlJTIyJTNBJTIyZ2MlMjIlN0QlNUQ%3D' refers to the 'Chrome' segment.  This extension appends all of the default parameter values to your active tab (the experiment) and opens all segments into new tabs. This saves a lot of time.\n\nQ: Why would someone use this?\nA: This extension allows the quick opening of all segments. During an active test, a user can quickly open all segments and monitor performance. For example if Firefox or Chrome or Safari has some kind of bug affecting performance, a user can quickly cycle through all of the tabs/segments and notice the discrepancy."
