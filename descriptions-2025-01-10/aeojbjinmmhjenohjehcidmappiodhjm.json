The Api Request  capture tool allows you to do that much easier. \n\nWhat makes this tool different? \n\nCompared to other API request captures tools like Postman Interceptor, we actually captures the entire API call (i.e. both request and response and full headers and body) and make it easily sharable. \n\nWhat the current Update:\n\n- Now, the captured API request will be send to your Moesif Account to leverage all the advanced API analytics and sharing capabilities. Under 30,000 events/month is completely free. \n\nAbout Moesif:\n\nMoesif (https://www.moesif.com) enables API teams at UPS, You.com, Deloitte, and others to deeply understand customer API usage and ship better API products with user-centric API analytics and monetization, which enables you to:\n    - Understand customer API usage with user behavior analytics.\n    - Debug issues quickly with high-cardinality API logs and metrics.\n    - Get alerted of problems that impact customers.\n    - Track API KPIs with custom dashboards.\n    - Meter API usage and set up billing meters with integrations with Stripe, Chargebee, and custom billing platforms. \n\nBy using this extension, you agree to Moesif's terms of use (https://www.moesif.com/terms) and privacy policy (https://www.moesif.com/pravicy)."
