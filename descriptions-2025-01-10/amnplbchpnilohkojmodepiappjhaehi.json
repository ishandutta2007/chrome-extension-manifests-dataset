Even though Chrome DevTools has the network tab, it is hard to get a consolidated view of all the requests and also the filtering capability there is limited to the URI end points, but it is often required to search based on the request body or the API response. To Address this, we have developed a Chrome extension. The data displayed can also serve as a high-level documentation for your API\n\nI had fun creating this Chrome Extension, so I hope you enjoy using it. As always, for any feature requests or issues when using the extension, just let me know  by emailing me parmesh20120@gmail.com."
