What could be the problem?\nüëâ Several factors could influence the extension's operation. First, ensure that you have the necessary permissions on your Facebook or Instagram account. Additionally, you must be logged into your Instagram account for the extension to function correctly. If these conditions are met but issues persist, check whether your account is a business account linked via Facebook.\n\nü§î I see a 'Pending' status on posts, but I can't locate the comment. Why is that?\nüëâThis could be due to Instagram's comment limitations. There may be a temporary restriction on commenting activity for your account. Please review your Instagram account status to verify this.\n\n\n\nNew features coming soon:\n\nEnhanced tracking and management of requests within the EmbedSocial platform\nSupport for more social media platforms besides Instagram\nOptimized rights request templates for higher approval rates"
