This extension is built to add in those extra features as needed.\n\nFor now, there is only one new feature: adding preferred names for students. Toddle currently does not allow including student preferred names, which can make things difficult in some parts of the world where preferred names are very different from legal names. This addition allows the user to import a file with the student names matched with the preferred name, and the extension does the rest. It will add in a prefix preferred name everywhere it sees the student's legal name. That way you can easily keep track of who submitted what."
