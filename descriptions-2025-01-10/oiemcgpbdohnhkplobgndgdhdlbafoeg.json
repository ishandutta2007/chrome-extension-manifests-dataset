Just be patient!\n\nThe extension source code, as well as the risk model description is available here: \nhttps://github.com/tim-sha256/chess.com-anti-cheat\n\n*  High accuracy is considered 80%+ for rating in [0; 1500], and 90%+ for 1500+. \n** Accounts younger than 60 days are considered more risky, and the overall score for them is multiplied by 1,5."
