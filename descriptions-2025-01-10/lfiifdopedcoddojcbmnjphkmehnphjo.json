Letting go of the screen at the right time is key to avoiding a stick that is too long or too short, leading to a number of deaths, possibly from falling a great distance with massive blunt force trauma leading to the end of all. chief. Think of this stick as a bridge because that's exactly what it is. It will drop into place and your character will automatically cross your bridge to the other side\nDon't turn upside down for too long or you will hit your head on the oncoming cliff and of course that will end your game.\nAs you can see, it's not as easy as it looks. Bridge laying is definitely an art and a science that not everyone can master, especially with Stick Hero.\nBest of luck for play the game.\n\nInstall extension\nClick the Stick Hero icon on the Chrome toolbar\nand we will open a Stick Hero for you to play the game! You donâ€™t need to do anything else!\nHave fun!\n\nPlay more games on the left-bar menu\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\n\nv1.0.0\n- First release"
