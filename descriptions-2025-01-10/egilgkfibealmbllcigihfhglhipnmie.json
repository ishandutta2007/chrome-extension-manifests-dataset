When finished, a password for that login page has been generated. You can then click on the icon on the right or press enter to paste it into clipboard, then just paste it in the login form. For each website, the generated password is different.\n\nThe master password is hashed a large number of time with the domain’s site generating an unique password for that site. Hashing algorithm is scrypt (which is memory resistant).\n\nNote that your master password should be strong (more than 10 characters in lower and upper case, numbers and special characters). Using simple password makes brute force attack easier.\n\nOther password tools (LastPass, KeyPass, etc) usually stores websites passwords into a encrypted database.\nThe drawback of that approach is that the database needs to be synced between all of your devices.\nUniquePasswordBuilder doesn’t uses a central database because it recomputes your password each time. \nFor increased security, you can set a `user salt`, which make it even more resilient against rainbow table attacks.\n\nYou can use CTRL + SHIFT + L to open the addon.\n\nThat addon is free software and you can study the source code here : https://github.com/paulgreg/UniquePasswordBuilder\nYou’ll find further information on the project home page : https://paulgreg.me/UniquePasswordBuilder/"
