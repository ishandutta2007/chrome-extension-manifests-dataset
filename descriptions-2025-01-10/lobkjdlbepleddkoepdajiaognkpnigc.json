Every 20 minutes the script will check your torrent pages to see if anything has changed and update your torrents accordingly. At times you might want to Reset your snatched or perform a full update (without resetting). On Firefox these option will appear in the Greasemonkey menu. To do this on Chrome, go to any torrents.php page and the dialog should appear to allow you to click on the links.\n\nThe status box will ALWAYS appear when you go to any torrents.php page. There are a number of options available. Click on the \"Options\" link to check them out.\n\nFor updates, and more information see the official thread here: https://redacted.ch/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=4082"
