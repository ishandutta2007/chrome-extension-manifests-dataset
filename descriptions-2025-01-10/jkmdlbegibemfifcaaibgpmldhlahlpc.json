For instance, to set the flag \"browse_column_resizing\" to \"ON\", you would load the url \"www.dropbox.com/home?stormcrow_override=browse_column_resizing:ON\". \n\nThe Stormcrow Override Manager (SOM) is an extension that will create the stormcrow override string for you, attach it to the url, and remember it so that the next time you don't have to type it again. \n\nInstructions for use:\n* Type the name of you feature in the text field and press Enter or click the \"+\" button.\n* Make sure your feature is toggled as active using the checkbox (by default it will be) and the value of the overrides is correct (ON, OFF, or CUSTOM)\n* Add any additional overrides you want\n* Click Apply Overrides\n\n* Overrides you don't think you'll use anymore can be sent to the archive with the garbage icon button on the right. They can be recovered or permanently removed through the Archive page (see tab at the top).\n\nUsage notes:\n* Stormcrow overrides only work if you are signed into a Dropbox work account AND on the Dropbox network via VPN or by being in an office. To make them work in other circumstances use an override token (see https://www.dropbox.com/admin/stormcrow#/override).\n* Stormcrow overrides will persist for five minutes by default if not \"refreshed\" by reloading the page with the override in the url. Adding the query param \"&stormcrow_override_ttl=600000\" will extend the time by the specified number of seconds."
