Use our new side-panel extension to create links you can paste anywhere such as LinkedIN or Facebook, or use Consensus SNAP with direct integration inside Gmail. Create custom branded experiences for prospects and customers (called DemoBoards) right from the browser. Create thumbnail, button, or text links and share them instantly. Set up team-based notifications so that SDRs, AEs, and SEs can all be notified when a key prospect and buying group begins engaging with or sharing your demo.\n \nBut don't stop there. Consensus SNAP allows your AEs and SEs to quickly Record, Send, and Track instant webcam and screen recording video right inside Chrome. Use these videos within a DemoBoard and create reusable libraries of video FAQ responses or create a tailored response to a prospect's burning question, and track how they watch and share with others in the buying group.\n \nWith a simple click, anyone can create, send and track a custom video within a DemoBoard. Record your webcam and capture anything on your screen, such as PowerPoint, a sales proposal, or visually explain your software. Consensus Snap notifies you when your prospect watches or shares your video. Drill down and look at the engagement statistics to see what they watched and rewatched."
