Still, this extension does not require any such access. \n\nThis app uses a Chrome storage sync feature to store your data. \nIf you log in to another system in the Chrome browser, your Checklistz data will be synched.\n\nThis tool can be used to:\n1. Create a list of tasks focused on today.\n2. Mark the task as checked or done by clicking on the list item.\n3. Delete the task item by clicking on the close icon\n4. Reorder them using the reorder icon\n\nIf you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, please reach out to us at:\n\nrajeevkjayaswal@gmail.com"
