This extension optimize the page to make it more responsive so that you spend less time reviewing code and more time drinking beer üçª.\n\n### Usage\nFor non Pull Request page the extension will be inactive.\nOn a PR compare page it will get active but by default it will be disabled.\nIf you feel your page is getting slow on a big PR you can click and enable it. You can toggle it back if you want.\n\n### How does it optimize?\nIt applies a simple trick by detaching file diffs which are not visible and reattach them when they are about to come on viewport. Less DOM nodes in a DOM Tree, more performant the page it. And it does it performantly using Intersection Observer API https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API.\n\n### Known caveats.\n- As for optimization it detaches file diff from the page, browser find will not work as expected. Though you can search with a file name but not the content.\n- Count in Review changes gets incorrect, but actually it does not affect any review comments. So don't get scared if number shows wrong."
