Wiki Readifyer makes the knowledge you are searching for pleasantly readable. The wisdom you desire to read is just one installation away!\nAnd the best thing: It doesn't remove anything from the page it only changes the layout while staying 100% faithful* to the original contents.\n\nThe following changes are applied to guarantee the best possible experience:\n• responsive layout: articles are pleasantly readable at any window size\n• slight reduction of text-background-contrast\n• reduction of article width\n• moving the table of contents to the right where it stays even when scrolling\n• the title also stays visible when scrolling down\n• some other little adjustments\n\n*However, if the window width is too small the extension will hide the left sidebar, only to guarantee the best use of your precious screen space. To make it visible again, just make the window wider.\n\nIn 2023, many Wikipedias changed their default theme to Vector 2022, a more modern and user-friendly theme. Wiki Readifyer does not touch Wikipedia's layout if any theme other than the old (legacy) Vector theme is active. This means, to get the advertised layouts on Wikipedias with the new theme, you have to turn off the new skin."
