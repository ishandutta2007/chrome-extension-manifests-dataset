This allows a person to focus on what they really care about and not be distracted by addicting or unhealthy content. You can have a dialog with yourself and fight your impulsive behavior on your terms. Iâ€™ve found this more effective than straight blocking unhealthy websites.\n\nThe popups close within ten seconds or if a person clicks the close button. They can also be removed from sites if the popup is no longer helpful. \n\nMade this extension for myself. I believe it can help other people since it has been helping me.\n\nCheck out the source code on Github:\nhttps://github.com/flynnstone9/stoic-focus"
