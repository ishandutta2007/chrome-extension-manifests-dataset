Perhaps, you have wanted to customize your user interface to utilize your favorite colors? This is the extension for you.\n\nBetter UofT provides University of Toronto websites with the option for custom theming that will help you to stay immersed within the rest of your dark mode content. Currently the extension supports Weblogin fully, with support for Acorn and Quercus in the works!\n\nClicking on the extension icon will open the extension's drop down where you are able to toggle between dark and light mode as well as turn the extension on and off. Additionally, you are able to open the custom theming panel which allows you to change the paper and accent color's hue and saturation.\n\nVisit our website to learn more about the extension and experiment with our custom theming, https://betteruoft.ca.\n\nThis is an open-source project. To contribute or to see the latest developments visit the GitHub repository at https://github.com/Cayendo-Org/better-uoft."
