For those super annoying sites that interfere with keyboard shortcuts and context menu, using Edit -> Paste from the browser's menu might be required.\n\nVersion 2 is a major update to the extension. It makes it much easier to ensure the extension is only running on sites that are bad actors with copy & paste events and it also provides visibility into the active/inactive state of the extension for each tab.\n\nIn order to provide the smoothest experience as possible, the extension needs to know when you change active tabs. In order for the extension to know about that event, it needs the \"tabs\" permission, which Chrome describes as \"can read and change all your data on websites you visit.\" That description is very scary, and is certainly not what this extension is doing. Being an open-sourced project, you can always read all the code to see how this extension works, and what it's [not] doing with your data."
