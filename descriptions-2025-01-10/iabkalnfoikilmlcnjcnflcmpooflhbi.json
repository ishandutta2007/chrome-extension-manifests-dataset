If users wanted more information, for example, they could click on hyperlinks that will lead to the professors RMP page.   It also features a chatbot to help advise students in picking classes.  This chatbot provides general information about courses and professors, as well as the ability to recommend classes based on the user's current progress.\n\nThis extension is not officially affiliated with UCSB."
