Since it's difficult for us to track fake reviews. \n\nWe’ve built a community-based tracking system. Here's how to use this:\n1. Add the extension to your browser\n2. Authenticate your App/s\n3. Go to your Shopify App reviews and report fake reviews.\n4. All these fake reviews will end up on the ‘loser-board’ which will be visible to all App Devs.\n\nWe'll be sending a report to Shopify once a week. Hopefully, they find these reports useful."
