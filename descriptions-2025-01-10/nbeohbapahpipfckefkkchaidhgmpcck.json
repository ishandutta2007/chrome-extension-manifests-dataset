This makes it very handy for several tasks; therefore, it is easy to have critical visual references handy at a glance while doing whatever it is.\n\nThe extension's design is minimalistic and user-oriented, accenting ease of use. Uploads of images are speedy and facile: with just one button click, the user opens the upload tab, where any image file can be chosen from the computer. KeyDisplay does support quite a wide range of file formats, including usual ones like PNG and WEBP, which enables flexibility and support for most types of images.\n\nIt is of particular utility for the user working on a document and needing to have one's references visible onscreen without the annoyance of constant window or tab switching. These could be cases like uploading a picture of the color code one works within some design or an essay structure picture to follow in writing. Having the picture on-screen, KeyDisplay allows better focus on smooth workflow without blemishes from interruptions.\n\nThe extension is designed to be simple, letting the user upload it as quickly as possible. Its interface is easy to use, so the user won't need to get bogged down in the minute details of the operation. However, with multi-format support, users can upload any image they need without compatibility issues getting in the way.\n\nThis extension is valid, showing images for reference with most tasks smoothly. Its straightforward layout and fast upload time allow it to support various file formats, making it a good productivity enhancement tool for users who need to have critical visual aids at hand."
