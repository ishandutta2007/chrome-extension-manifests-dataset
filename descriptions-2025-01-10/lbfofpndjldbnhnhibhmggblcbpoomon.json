You can comment on Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets, and Google Forms with your voice. \n\nYou never have to leave Google Docs to record or listen to voice notes as everything is integrated into Docs. \n\nWhy audio comments?\n\nGiving feedback can be challenging. You have to capture all your thoughts but also convey them in a tone that's constructive and positive.  This is a lot harder to do if you're just trying to type comments. With voice, you can more quickly convey what you want to get across and make sure the tone is positive and clear.  \n\nHow it works?\n1. Install the extension above.\n2. Visit Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, or Google Forms.  \n3. Add a comment and click \"voice comment\" to record.\n\nThat’s all it takes. A link will be inserted into the comment and that link will be auto-magically converted into an embedded player for anyone who has the extension installed.  So you can listen to all the comments without leaving Google docs! \n\n*New Feature* Automatically expire voice comments to auto-delete after a certain length of time. \n\nWho’s it for?\n\nCollaborative Teams\nGreat teams know the value of feedback. With Beep you can leave comments with a positive, constructive tone and make your team feel more connected. \n\nEditors\nReading manuscripts or article drafts can be exhausting. With voice memos, you can convey more, faster.  \n\nProfessors\nGrading papers and providing feedback can take a serious amount of time. Beep saves you time by allowing you to voice your feedback and allows you to have a more personal connection with your students.  \n\n\n***Disclaimer***\nThis app is not affiliated with or officially endorsed by Google or Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, or Forms in any way"
