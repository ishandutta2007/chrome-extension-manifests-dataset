Everyone is welcome to contribute!\n\nThis plugin aims to provide a quality dark theme for Crunchyroll.com. This is primarily because dark themes are easier on the eye when in a darker environment. It also leaves a button in the toolbar to quickly disable and re-enable the theme.\n\nIf there are any un-themed pages, or other issues such as weird color choices, please report them!\n\nChangelog: Available at http://github.com/tholinka/Dark-Crunchyroll-Plugin/releases\n\nThis project is originally based off of the Dark Youtube Plugin for Chrome https://github.com/georgyangelov/Dark-youtube-plugin-chrome, though most of the code involved has since been rewritten."
