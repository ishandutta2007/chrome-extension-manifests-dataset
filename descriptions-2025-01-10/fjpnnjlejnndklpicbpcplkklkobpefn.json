Every 20 minutes, it shows a notification that says \"WIBGIDT?\" and \"Think.\" \"WIBGIDT\" stands for \"Will I be glad I did this?\".\n\nHelps you focus and avoid procrastination. Useful for people with ADHD and concentration issues. Sometimes if you're doing something else when you should be working, all you need is a gentle reminder.\n\nYou can't adjust the time interval. You can't adjust the message. It's as simple as it can possibly be."
