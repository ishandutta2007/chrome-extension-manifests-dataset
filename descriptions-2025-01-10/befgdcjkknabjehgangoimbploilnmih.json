People often fully trust content creators who may not always be objective, creating the risk that the creator may manipulate information, and influence consumers. Therefore, it is important to consider the opinions of others about specific content, especially on platforms like YouTube, where content creators often express subjective views that consumers may perceive as facts. Hence, it is crucial to learn what other people think about a particular opinion or content and draw conclusions.\n\nConcluding by analyzing a few comments is quick and convenient, but when there are hundreds or thousands, such analysis requires considerably more time. Therefore, a Google Chrome extension has been developed that examines and evaluates sentiments of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of comments, categorizing them as positive, neutral, or negative. The extension also displays the percentage distribution of comments in a specific section related to the theme expressed in the video content."
