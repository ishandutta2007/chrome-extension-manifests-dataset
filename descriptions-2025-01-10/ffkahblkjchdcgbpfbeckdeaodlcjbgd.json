You'll also get notifications each time a new article is published (the timeout is set to 15 minutes).\n\nClicking the WebUpd8 icon on the toolbar lists the latest 15 articles: unread articles have a small thumbnail and a description while for read articles, only the title is displayed. You can click each item in the popup to visit the article on http://www.webupd8.org, at which point the article will be marked as read. Also, when clicking on a new article notification, the item will be marked as read and the article will be loaded in a new browser tab.\n\nYou can also mark all items as read using the button on top of the extension popup window.\n\nThe extension has been tested with Google Chrome stable (24) and unstable (26) as well as Chromium unstable (26).\n\nAbout WebUpd8: this is an Ubuntu / Linux / open source software blog which delivers daily news, tips and application reviews. We follow the Ubuntu and GNOME development and keep you up to date with everything new and interesting."
