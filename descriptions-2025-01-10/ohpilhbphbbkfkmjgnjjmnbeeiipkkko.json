You can also redirect URLs to text documents that you can create with this extension. If you need to inject JavaScript or CSS files, this extension has you covered.\n\nThis tool is great for debugging production websites, as you can edit and inject code on the fly. You no longer have to scan through minified code as you can just redirect to an unminified version or paste in the unminified version with the integrated file editor.\n\nFeel free to contribute to this project!\nhttps://github.com/kylepaulsen/ResourceOverride"
