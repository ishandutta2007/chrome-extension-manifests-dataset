You may be downloading a big torrent file but a small glitch could stall the download overnight.\n\nWe think this app could help you alert the moment wifi or ethernet drops. Once you install, click 'Start Checking' Button to monitor the internet connection.\n\nIf the internet goes down, a small alert audio will go on loop until you click 'Acknowledge' button. You can switch off the checking whenever you want...\n\nWe made sure to use two minimum latency connections to check your internet. So, Dont worry about network consumption... \n\nP.S> Its a very initial version. It definitely have a lot of room for development. Please send feeback for bugs/improvements."
