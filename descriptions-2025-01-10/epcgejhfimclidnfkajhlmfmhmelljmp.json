After logging in to this platform, they can add articles to their libraries with the DOI number of the articles, the RIS files of the articles, or the tag information of the articles. Instead of copying DOI numbers, it is easier to add the article to the library by selecting any DOI number in Chrome, right-clicking it and clicking Send to ARRefMan with this extension."
