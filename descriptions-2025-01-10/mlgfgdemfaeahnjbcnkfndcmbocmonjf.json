Clicking on any of the 4 buttons will open SEMrush in the appropriate place and already add the URL you are currently viewing to the tool.\n\n** The links we use may contain affiliate links and we may be compensated if you end up purchasing anything after using our tool.\n\nWhen doing SEO and digital marketing, we always need to use multiple tools in order to help us out with the task. One of the most known tools to help out SEOs is \"Semrush\". Semrush not only helps out with SEO, but it also offers lots of information in regards to digital marketing as a whole. You can get information about the pages on any site you want to learn about, traffic estimation, content ideas, Google ads and much more.\n\nUsually what we do when looking at an interesting site is copy its URL, go to Semrush, paste the URL and start learning about it. With \"Open This is Semrush\" you can simplify this by just clicking a button, deciding what section of Semrush you want to open, and that's it.\n\nThis extension just simplifies the process and makes things move a bit faster."
