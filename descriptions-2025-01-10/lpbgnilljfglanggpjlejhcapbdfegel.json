No more blog post, no more ads!\n\nFAQ:\n\nWhy didn't it work for my recipe?\nRecipeLink is in Beta and may not work on all pages. Currently it just searches for the \"Ingredients\" section on the page, but not all Recipe sites may use this. Only English is currently supported, sorry!\n\nWhy do you need to read and change my data on all sites?\nWe can't list out every site that may contain a recipe, so instead we need to read the content of each page to determine if it's a recipe. Then, we need to modify the page content to add the button the jump straight to the recipe."
