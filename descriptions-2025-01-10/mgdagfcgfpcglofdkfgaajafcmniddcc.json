It also provides personalized explanations for anything you read online, from slang to technical terms.\n\nSimply (1) select any word or phrase on a web page, (2) click the purple circle that appears.\n\nYou can also save selections you want to memorize to you personal list. Or, share selections with friends!\n\nExplain Selected is particularly helpful for words with multiple meanings. Take the word \"pounds\", for example. Does it refer to a weight, an action, or perhaps the British currency? Unlike other dictionary applications, Explain Selected will figure out which meaning is relevant using contextual disambiguation, intelligently inferring which meaning is being used.\n\nWe hope it helps you! \n\nNOTE: This extension will not work in tabs that were open prior to installing this extension. After installing, please refresh these tabs to use the extension. Additionally, no extensions will work on Chrome Web Store pages (including this page)."
