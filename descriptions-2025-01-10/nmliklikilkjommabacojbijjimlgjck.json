If you have many calendars and often need to switch between which calendars are shown (such as colleagues and teams), this extension is for you.\n\nYour presets are stored in your local browser storage and sync across devices automatically (using Chrome's built in syncing mechanism).\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts:\nPress Ctrl+Alt and the highlighted key for the main functions (highlighted key is one of e, s, r, c, i, x, or p).\n\n\nPRIVACY & SECURITY\n\nExcept Chrome's built-in sync mechanism, the extension functions completely offline in the browser and no data leaves the user's computer. Local storage in the browser is used to persist saved calendar groups and to sync saved groups across computers via Chrome's built-in sync mechanism (tied to the logged in Chrome user). All software is fully open source and available at https://gitlab.com/bluenexa/google-calendar-selector.\n\n\nBuilt by the team at Bluenexa."
