Eliminating the need to type in usernames and passwords multiple times throughout the day, QwickACCESS users simply tap their badge to access their session then again to secure it. QwickACCESS' unique proximity badge functionality also allows users to 'tap-over' another user's session, securing the open session and enabling it to be access anywhere on supported devices. Enhancing user compliance with privacy and security policies, QwickACCESS strengthens data security while boosting user convenience and efficiency.\n\nThis new solution brings HealthCast, Citrix, and Google together to provide a versatile and cost-effective approach to resolving desktop security, application delivery, and user productivity challenges. Users gain an average of 30-45 minutes each day while organizations achieve better compliance with data security and privacy regulations and simplified device management. \n\nSolution Requirements\nhttps://documentation.gohealthcast.com/qacd/latest/solution-requirements\n\nFollow HealthCast on\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/healthcastinc?lang=en \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/company/55143/ \nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ZBXStlVanb1ugDbVgpfFg \n\nTo Contact Us, please visit our website at www.gohealthcast.com and click the Contact Us button."
