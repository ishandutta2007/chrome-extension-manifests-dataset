Integration with Figma API allows you to compare a design and its implementation in one click and immediately see what needs to be fixed.\n\nWhy?\n\n- No export/import: design is taken directly from Figma automatically;\n- No need to spend time setting up. Ghost Screen opens your site with required resolution and places the design above it in correct way;\n- It is convenient to compare a 1920px design and a site in a required resolution even on a 1020x768 laptop.\n\nHow it works?\n\nInstall from the official Chrome Store → Sign in with your Figma account → Choose a frame and its implementation to compare. Then Ghost Screen will define how to accurately lay out the design of any size on top of the site."
