Also as a result of using Teal, you have to endure advertisements on various websites. Moreover, its checklists are not dynamic and you may be asked to update your profile even if it‚Äôs already updated. On the other hand, the Careerflow extension provides you with best practices for each and every section, an interactive walkthrough, as well as a profile score from 0 to 100. \n\nüßê Is it free or paid?\n‚û°Ô∏è  Most of the features are completely free to use, such as the LinkedIn Optimizer and the Job Tracker. We do have some Premium (paid) features that utilize advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) that require a cost to run and maintain, hence they are available for Premium users only. A majority of users are able to 2X their LinkedIn Profiles and keep track of their job search completely for free!\n\n----\n* WE DO NOT SELL YOUR DATA TO ANY 3RD PARTIES *\n\nBy downloading this extension, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service here: https://careerflow.ai/terms and our Privacy Policy here: https://careerflow.ai/privacy\n\nDisclaimer: Careerflow.ai is an independent Chrome browser extension and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way connected to LinkedIn Corporation or any other brands or sites. \n\n\"Careerflow\" and \"Career Copilot\" are trademarks of Careerflow Inc. and any other trademarks referenced are properties of their respective trademark owners.\n\nFor more info visit https://www.careerflow.ai\n\nNeed help?
