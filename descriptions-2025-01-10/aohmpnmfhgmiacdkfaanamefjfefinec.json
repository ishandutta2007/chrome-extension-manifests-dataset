The goal is to clear the field of all bubbles, you can do this by making combinations of 3 or more bubbles to clear them. Repeat this until all bubbles are gone and you win the game. In the bottom left you will find your miss counter, if you shoot a bubble and don't make a combination one bubble of your miss counter is retracted. If your miss counter is empty a new line of bubbles will form on the top. So watch out that you don't miss too often."
