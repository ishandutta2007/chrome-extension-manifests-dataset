Among other things, it allows you to roll dice for ability checks, attacks and features.\n\nWhen you have both Elder Dragon's Tavern and the Roll20 virtual table top open in your browser, this extension will send all your dice roll to the Roll20 chat, so that you can easily roll dice from your character sheet in your session and share them with other players. On top of that, it can also link feature blocks, spell blocks, write chat messages when you take damage, receive healing and more."
