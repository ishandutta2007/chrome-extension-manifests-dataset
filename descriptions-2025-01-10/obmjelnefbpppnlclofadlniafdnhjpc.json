For best results open a new tab and hit: http://espn.com/nba/scoreboard.\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n- Fits everything on one page. Team box scores appear side-by-side rather than stacked.\n\nIf you wish to remove ads you will need to use an ad blocker.\n\nUPDATES\n\nv 1.3.4   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nDecember 26th 2024\n\n- Improve handling of ABC / ESPN broadcaster combinations.\n\nv 1.3.3   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNovember 30th 2024\n\n- Adds G-League scores to popover and applies CSS and JS to G-League pages. \n\nv 1.3.2   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNovember 23rd 2024\n\n- Adds national broadcaster icons to NBA popover.\n\nv 1.3.1   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNovember 13th 2024\n\n- Fix advanced stats being duplicated and never updated\n- Fix score in tab for college sports (was previously undefined)\n- In extension popup, reset page number to one when user changes date or sport\n\nv 1.3.0   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNovember 1st 2024\n\n- Adds play-by-play highlighting (green for positive plays, red for negative).\n- Adds scores to tab (eg. MIL 48 - 70 MEM).\n- Scores now update every extension popover / popup.\n- Adds NCAA Mens and Womens support (this may be a little janky to start with and I've disabled advanced stats until I can make sure they line up with Basketball References numbers.\n- Adds pagination to extension popover / popup. Not sure if this will ever be necessary but with the addition of college sports there may be some epic game days (eg March Madness).\n\nv 1.2.0   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nOctober 11th 2024\n\n- Previous day stays active for 8 hours after midnight EST. This means you won't have to navigate back to the previous day while the late west coast games are still live.\n\nv 1.1.9   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nOctober 3rd 2024\n\n- Adds fallback icon in case team logo can't be found (this happens a bit in pre-season with the non-NBA teams).\n\nv 1.1.8   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nOctober 1st 2024\n\n- Fixes an issue where scoreboard and standings links weren't being updated when a user changed sports.\n\nv 1.1.7   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nSeptember 28th 2024\n\n- Adds sport nav to toggle between NBA and WNBA.\n\nv 1.1.6   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nSeptember 26th 2024\n\n- Highlight on-court players.

That means no advanced stats, highlighting stats as they change, show current on court players, play-by-play stats below the box score, and all of the other cool stuff.\n\n\nv 0.3.39   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nDecember 3rd 2021\n\n- Adds \"Standings\" button to extension popover for easier access.\n\n\nv 0.3.38   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nAugust 7th 2021\n\n- Updates for Vegas Summer League.\n\n\nv 0.3.37   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nJuly 2nd 2021\n\n- Fixes games incorrectly linking to summer league box scores.\n\n\nv 0.3.36   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nApril 18th 2021\n\n- Styled updates to make background colour consistently white.\n- Fixes play-by-play iframe on box score page.\n- Updates link in extension popover so it uses ESPN's updated \"/_/\" style URL scheme.\n\n\nv 0.3.35   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nApril 16th 2021\n\n- Updated to handle new URLs. This fixes a bug where clicking between box scores would cause the extension to stop working.\n\n\nv 0.3.34   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nDecember 13th 2020\n\n- 2020-21 season updates.\n\n\nv 0.3.33   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nJuly 31st 2020\n\n- Further summer league popup fixes\n\n\nv 0.3.32   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nJuly 27th 2020\n\n- Popup updates to handle NBA restart (don't look for Summer League schedule).\n\n\nv 0.3.31   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNovember 3rd 2019\n\n- Fixed a long-standing bug where advanced stats (pace, ORTG, etc) wouldn't work when there was less than 1 minute to go in a period. This was due to time being formatted as 58.3 instead of 10:40.\n\n\nv 0.3.30   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nOctober 28th 2019\n\n- Fix issue with team records not appearing in browser extension popup.\n\n\nv 0.3.29   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nJune 6th 2019\n\n- Handle ESPN's shift from http to https.\n\n\nv 0.3.28   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nMay 23rd 2019\n\n- Add support for WNBA.\n\n\nv 0.3.27   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nApril 4th 2019\n\n- Hide sponsored \"content\".\n\n\nv 0.3.26   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nMarch 17th 2019\n\n- Fixed a bug with play-by-play not updating after initial load.\n\n\nv 0.3.25   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nFebruary 16th 2019\n\n- Fixed an all-star weekend bug with all star teams not having win/loss records.\n\n\nv 0.3.24   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNovember 11th 2018\n\n- Added team foul count to play-by-play.

Big woop.\n- Highlight winning team in extension popup.\n\n\nv 0.3.10   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Reduced width of \"video highlights\"  and \"latest\" columns at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nv 0.3.8   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Added individual player advanced stats during live games.\n\n\nv 0.3.7   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Added daily leaders and season leaders to ESPN stat dropdown.\n- Fixed a bug with the game strip sticking to the page.

On the upside you no longer need to refresh the page in order for updates to be added (this was a limitation on ESPN's end).\n- Improved formatting of shot charts.\n- Hardset a cookie to turn off autoplay on the box score page. This may affect autoplay on other ESPN pages but autoplay is nasty and should be discouraged. Hit me up on twitter @lenymo if you have an objection to this.\n\n\nv 0.3.3   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Removed localised times in extension popup due to a bug.\n\n\nv 0.3.2   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Localised times in popup.\n- Added more days to popup nav.\n\n\nv 0.3.1   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Updated the extension popup with game scores and quick links to box score (accessible by clicking the red basketball extension icon).\n- Updated Fan Duel scoring formula to be consistent with new official NBA fantasy scoring rules (these are accessibly by clicking the [ ] ADVANCED STATS checkbox once a game is over.\n- Updated the background color behind some team logos because they looked whack (Boston, Atlanta and Phoenix).\n- Released 19th October 2017.\n\n\nv 0.2.4   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Added highlighting of on-court players to box score. This works based on the five players whose stats were most recently updated, so it usually takes a short while to kick in after a game starts or after a stoppage (time out, end of quarter). The most reliable stats to indicate who's on court are +/- and minutes because these increase even if a player doesn't add any stats but this does mean it can take a while to update if no one scores for a minute or two.\n- Added handy links which appear when you hover the ESPN logo. I'll probably try and make this menu more obvious at some point.\n- Updated styling of new team logos.\n\n\nv 0.2.3   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Added team BLK%, STL%.\n- Improved speed of play-by-play highlighting.\n- Updated format of team shooting percentage (50.0% instead of .500).

These numbers currently differ slightly from basketball reference's numbers.\n\n\nv 0.2.0   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Added individual player advanced stats once a game is finished. Still ironing out bugs for this to work during a live game.\n- Added highlighting to play-by-play.\n- In the works: \n  - Advanced team stats for college hoops.\n  - Live individual player advanced stats.\n\n\nv 0.1.8   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n- Set all player links to open in a new tab.\n- Fixed player links for Australian users (if any other countries are experiencing issues let me know)."
