But, this doesn't work if you need to look something up now and then. For this reason I am a big fan of DK's 'Intention' extension [1], which instead of blacklisting websites, 'unlocks' them for a certain period of time.\n\nIn my daily work though, this created a lot of friction because estimating and unlocking time periods distracted me from the actual work.\nÂ«With IntentionÂ» is essentially a reduction of DK's extension: by simply and only writing down the intention when visiting certain websites, intentional working is reinforced and accidental mindless browsing is reduced.\n\nThe extension is open source and hosted on GitHub [2].\n\nðŸ”— Links\n[1] https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/intention-stop-mindless-b/dladanhaondcgpahgiflodhckhoeohoe\n[2] https://github.com/alexwidua/with-intention"
