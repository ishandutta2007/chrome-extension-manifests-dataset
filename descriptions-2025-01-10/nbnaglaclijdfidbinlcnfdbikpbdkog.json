When you want to whip out a sassy :oh_is_that_so: or a quizzical :pikathonk: in that github comment, you have been entirely out of luck.\n\nWith this extension, you've lucked in to a fix for that terrible existential problem; you can bring your Slack custom emoji with you, wherever you go in Chrome. There are a few primary functions:\n\n1) Expanding existing emoji-formatted text into actual emoji, e.g. turning `:parrot:` into that little ugly slug thing that does not actually look like a parrot, and\n\n2) Searching for and inserting emoji as rich content, whether that means a link to the emoji url, an html `<img>`, or a markdown image. Activate search using the `:` prefix in the chrome omnibar.\n\n3) More easily retrieving critical emoji-related information from Slack, such as your user authentication information, which can be used with many open source projects, including [emojme](https://github.com/jackellenberger/emojme)"
