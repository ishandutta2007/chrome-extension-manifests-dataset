Rezvani\" instead of \"Mohamad Rezvani\")\n\nUpdate 0.0.0.4 (21 Jul 2024)\n- Fixes bug where some professors' RateMyProfessors ratings and De Anza course faculty page were not showing because they use shortened versioned of their government names (e.g. \"Dan Halabe\" instead of \"Daniel J. Halabe\")\n- Fixes bug where professors with the same first name in the same department weren't showing up (e.g. \"David Newton\" and \"David Laubner\" of the physics department)\n- TO FIX: A very few professor RMP ratings are not showing up because they have multiple entries on RMP. (Doli N. Bhambani, Vinh Kha T. Nguyen, Alex Giardino, Al Hussein, and Luis Limcolioc). Also, if you don't see a professor, check if they teach at other nearby colleges, such as most of the De Anza Fall 2024 chemistry teachers have RMP profiles from Foothill.\n\nUpdate 0.0.0.3 (3 Apr 2024)\n- Fixes known bug issues\n- CTRL+B/CMD+B no longer opens up the menu\n\nVersion 0.0.0.2 (23 Feb 2024)\n- Aggregates and displays public grade distributions via TransferCamp per department directly within the course selection interface at De Anza College\n\nVersion 0.0.0.1 (21 Feb 2024)\n- Aggregates and displays professor ratings and course information via RateMyProfessors directly within the course selection interface at De Anza College\n- Weaves essential information by transforming interface to clickable links\n\n## About:\nA Journey of Innovation Begins\n\nAt Eyecademia, our journey is guided by a vision that marries simplicity with profound impact, an endeavor that begins in its current, early alpha phase.
