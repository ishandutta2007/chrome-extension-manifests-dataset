Storing them in a physical location or a note-taking app might seem convenient, but it compromises your security.  MetaPass offers a revolutionary solution that eliminates the need to save passwords altogether. \n\n**How MetaPass Works:**\n\nMetaPass employs a unique on-demand password generation system. You only need to remember one customized string of characters (your \"Magic Word\").  The extension then combines this with the website domain and your account name to generate a strong, unique password every time you need it.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Effortless Password Generation:** Simply input the website domain, your account name, and your Magic Word, and MetaPass instantly creates a complex, 14-character password with special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers.\n* **Enhanced Security:** Never store passwords again, minimizing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.\n* **File-Based Magic Word:**  For added security, you can choose a file instead of manually entering your Magic Word. MetaPass will use the file's MD5 hash to generate your password, ensuring consistency and convenience.\n* **Complete Privacy:** MetaPass operates entirely locally, with no server interaction or data collection. Your information remains private and secure.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Launch MetaPass:** Click the extension button to open the pop-up window. The current website domain will be automatically populated in the \"Website Domain\" field. You can also manually enter a custom domain or any string you can remember.\n2. **Enter Account Name:** Input your account name for the current website in the \"Account Name\" field. Different account names will generate different passwords.\n3. **Set Your Magic Word:** Enter a memorable string in the \"Magic Word\" field. Alternatively, click the \"Select File\" button to choose a file. The file's MD5 hash will automatically appear in the \"Magic Word\" field. You can use the same file to generate passwords consistently without memorizing the Magic Word.\n4. **Generate and Copy:** Click the \"Generate Password\" button to create your password. Click the \"Copy\" button to copy it to your clipboard.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Never leave the \"Account Name\" or \"Magic Word\" fields empty.** This prevents others from generating the same password for that website domain.\n* **Choose a strong and unique Magic Word.** Avoid simple or easily guessable strings.\n* **You can use the same Magic Word for all websites and accounts**, as long as you keep it confidential and secure.\n\n\n**Privacy Policy:**\n\nMetaPass is a purely local tool with no server interaction or data collection."
