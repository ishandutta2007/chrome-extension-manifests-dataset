You'll be able to click to the methods, variables or classes and go to their definitions, and also click to the declarations to find out where they are used at. It works both for tree views and pull requests, so whenever someone sends you a pull request, you'll be able to review it more efficiently, since you actually can click to the methods and see where they come from.\n\nYou can check https://github.com/astashov/crossdart-chrome-extension for README, source code and details how to use it for very private projects, when you don't want to send your source code to CrossDart servers, but still want to use the plugin."
