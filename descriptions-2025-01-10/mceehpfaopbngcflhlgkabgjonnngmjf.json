This is fine if you know which airports the (sometimes obscure) codes refer to. This extension finds any airport codes in the text of the current page, and adds a tooltip with the full airport name.\n\nPress the plane icon to add the tooltips when needed. The extension doesn’t run automatically on any pages as there are too many false positives for common abbreviations (such as ATM and PDF).\n\nI originally made this just to be lazy when I’m looking at Twitter, so it’s very simple at the moment. I’m open to suggestions for improving the extension.\n\n• Code is open source at https://github.com/gilmoreorless/convert-airport-codes\n• Airport data provided in the Public Domain by OurAirports: http://ourairports.com/data/\n• Icon from EmojiOne, licensed CC-BY 4.0: http://emojione.com/"
