You won't have to configure global paths in the Chrome extension or anything like that!\n\nIf you don't have it installed, don't worry, Visual Studio Code will install it for you once you click over any of the links provided by this extension.\n\nYou can learn more about how this works here:\nhttps://github.com/robertohuertasm/vscode-open"
