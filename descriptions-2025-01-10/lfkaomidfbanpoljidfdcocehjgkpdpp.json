It's annoying, manual, and error-prone.\n\nCalendify simplifies that for you! It extracts events out of the webpage you're on and lets you add the event (or multiple events) to your favorite calendar app! Supported: Google Calendar, Yahoo, iCal, Outlook\n\nIt will parse out event details and let you edit them before adding to your calendar. Multiple events are a breeze!\n\n## Right click => Highlighting events\nToo many events on the page? Just highlight the one you're interested in, right click and Calendify!\n\nShortcut:\nUse Ctrl + Shift + E to trigger the extension on Windows,\nCmd + Shift + E on Mac!\n\nLatest updates:\nSignificantly faster event parsing.\n\nNotes: \n- As a free extension, it will get better over time, feedback and bug reports are welcome :)\n- The Google Events webpage is not supported. It has great add-to-calendar functionality already.\n- Email inboxes are not fully supported."
