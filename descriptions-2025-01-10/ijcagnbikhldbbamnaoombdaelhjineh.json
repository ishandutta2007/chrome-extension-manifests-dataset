In order to hide chats, you can archive them.\n\n  WhatsApp web by default, shows the archived chats on top of all chats, indicating that you have archived chats (not discreet at all), and every time you get a new message from an archived chat, a flashy notification is displayed on top, so It's very obvious that you're actively chatting with someone in archived chats.\n\nThis extension provides more privacy, hiding the archived chats section on top and moving this functionality to a small icon on the header profile, so nosy people won't notice that you have archived chats."
