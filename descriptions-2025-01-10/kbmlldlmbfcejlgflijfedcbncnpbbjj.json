Also, the only one.\n\nThis extension--well, it crawls through your pages' links and text, replacing words every now and then with the correct conjugation of the, umm, the word \"squanch.\"\n\nYou control the action. Use the popup and move the slider to your preferred level of...squanchiness. While the most feasible-yet-still-recurrently-chortle-inducing strategem might be to keep it at its lowest setting, when the homies are over you'd better believe you'll be squanching it to the max. There are many other levels to be explored.\n\nOh, and you can de-squanch and then re-squanch your browser with the click of a button if, I dunno, you're reading mission-critical dossiers and you can't afford to miss a word. But let's face it, genius: you can.\n\nMIT License. Do what you will.\n\n1.1 Less ugly now.\n\n1.2: Now featuring more subtle squanchiness for lower slider values. Turn it low, forget about it. Be pleasantly surprised every now and then.\n\n1.3: Squanchify no longer breaks like all your websites.\n\n1.4 No more unexpected squanching.\n\n1.5 Small fixes."
