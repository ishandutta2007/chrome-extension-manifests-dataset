This extension gives you full control over any video on almost any website.\n\nAlso useful for very long videos like lectures or stream vods when you want to speed up or skip over the boring bits.\n\n- Click the extension's icon to open the controls.\n- Add whatever buttons you want for controlling speed/time/volume.\n- Video controls can detach onto the webpage for easier access (shortcut is 'Alt+V').\n- If you have a mouse, use the scroll wheel to click the buttons (scroll up to go forward/faster/louder, down for the opposite).\n- If there are multiple videos on a page, hover over one to select it.\n\nEvery website is different so it won't always work perfectly, but it should work well 95% of the time.\n\nIt works on audio players too.\n\nOther info:\n - click a video in the video-control bar to scroll it into view\n - double click an icon on the left of a control bar to play/pause\n - it really works best when you use the scroll wheel"
