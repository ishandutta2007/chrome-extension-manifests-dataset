More features will be added soon.\n\nSmart Domains\n\nA traditional domain name tells a browser where to go, whereas a smart domain tells it what to do. Similar to a smart contract on the blockchain, a smart domain uses the power of the Hedera Hashgraph native layer to bring tokenized functionality to your domain’s URL. \n\nWhen you mint a smart domain, the DNS web address is instructed to access assigned decentralized data and inform the URL to execute specific tokenized transactions whenever the smart domain address is typed into a web browser. Simple, seamless and secure.\n\nAbout Us\n\nWeb23 is a secure DNS platform that allows users to register and tokenize domain names on Hedera Hashgraph; bringing utility and accessibility to both Web2 and Web3 domains. Our smart domains service lets you buy, sell and manage all your domain names in one place.\n\nOur mission is to become the one stop shop for both ICANN Web2 and tokenized Web3 domain name registration and minting. Our vision is to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 by providing browser access to decentralized data utility; connecting DNS to DLTs."
