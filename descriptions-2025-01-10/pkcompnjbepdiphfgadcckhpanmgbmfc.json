The D-Score brings a more reliable product rating to every product on Amazon search results page so you can quickly make an informed decision between many different products.\n\nThe D-Score is calculated by taking the percentage of 5-star ratings given to a product (the promoters) and subtracting the percentage of 1-star ratings given to the product (the detractors). This produces a score between -100 and 100 that proves to be a very accurate predictor of product quality.\n\nD-Scores above 80 are considered excellent products that you can have confidence in purchasing. In order to make D-Scores even easier to understand, the score is converted into between 0 and 5 filled in purple dots so you can compare products at a glance."
