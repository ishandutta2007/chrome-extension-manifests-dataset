It tells you how much interest you'll pay, shows monthly payments, and the total amount you'll pay back over the years. Default time intervals and interest rates are preset. Users may customize them as needed.\n\nIt's compatible with five different websites in The United States, The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand:\n\nhttps://www.rightmove.co.uk\nhttps://www.zillow.com\nhttps://www.realtor.ca\nhttps://www.realestate.com.au\nhttps://www.realestate.co.nz\n\nAfter the user opens the mentioned website, the tool will find the property's price. Based on this price, the plugin will calculate interest rates at various levels and time intervals, then create a table that will be inserted directly under the price."
