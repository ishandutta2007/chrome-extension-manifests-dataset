If you have ever used Soundtrap (Soundtrap.com), you know that whenever a collaborator leaves, joins, or saves a project, you hear a sound. If you are like me, you find those noises annoying. Especially when there are more than just a few people all working on the same project. And Soundtrap gives you no way to turn it off. \n\nWhenever Soundtrap attempts to load the OGG audio files for its notification sounds, this extension blocks those sounds from loading. So once you clear the cache for the Soundtrap site, it can no longer make the notification sounds. This does not break any other Soundtrap functionality.\n\nNote: You may (or may not) need to clear the cache for Soundtrap.com after installing the extension. If the extension does not appear to be working, try clearing the cache for Soundtrap.com and then reloading Soundtrap."
