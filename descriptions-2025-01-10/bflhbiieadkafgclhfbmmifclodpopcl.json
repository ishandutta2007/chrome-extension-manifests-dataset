You can choose between three different widths!\n\nWith this extension you can just make the website thinner, and put it in the middle of your screen with one click. Now its much easier to read --- its easier to keep track of lines, and easier on your brain and eyes. More like a book.\n\nRelease Notes:\n  - v0.2.0:\n    - Added \"Width\" preference. Set the width of the fix."
