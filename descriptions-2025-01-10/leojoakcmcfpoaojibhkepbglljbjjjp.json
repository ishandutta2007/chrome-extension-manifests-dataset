So if the NBA Top Shot website makes a change that breaks this extension, it will be multiple days until a working version is available on the official Chrome Store.\n\nThat being said, while pending changes are being approved you can find the most up to date version here: https://github.com/recnepsbackwards/top_shot_helper\n\nTop Shot Helper sorts listings on NBA Top Shot by price instead of serial number. Lower serial numbers are highlighted by specific colors. Custom colors can be changed in the settings (Windows only). Start making better buying decisions in the marketplace by downloading this extension.\n\nDonate a moment to the developer: https://www.nbatopshot.com/user/@spencer"
