Tired of losing track on which Chrome window you placed whicth tab? Did I just closed the site I was using? Did I leave it open?\n\nTry SpeedTabs now and navigate among your open tabs and bookmarks seamlessly using only your keyboard! \n\nJust remember this shortcut => Control + Q. \n\nPress these two keys at the same time and a simple search form shows up so you can easily reach any open tab or bookmark saved in Chrome by simply writting the first characters of any keyword contained in the site name or site url you are interested in. \n\nWanna use the tool like a pro? Pay attention to the shortcut hints that appears at the top right corner of the app when searching your tabs. \n\nThings between you and Control + Q have not been ok lately? Set whatever shortcut you like the most visiting Extensions > Keyboard Shortcuts on Chrome. \n\nAny good idea to make this Chrome extension any more awesome? (Like if that was even possible... ). Feel free to write whatever you like at the Reviews section!\n\nEnjoy!"
