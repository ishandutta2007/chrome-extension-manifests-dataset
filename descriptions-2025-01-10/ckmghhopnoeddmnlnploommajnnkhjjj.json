If they still don't appear, please let me know opening a GitHub issue\n- Going back in your history feed doesn't re-add the stats\n- If a playlist contains over forty-ish elements, Youtube Music might not render all the songs at once, and the extension can't add those ratings (it's just a visual bug, the ones that worked as expected will still be mathematically correct)"
