It is the best tool for removing advertisements across the web, including video advertisements on YouTube™!  I have no affiliation, it's just my favorite extension.\n\nNOT WORKING?\nPlease use the feedback button to alert me if YouTube™ is not being displayed properly.  YouTube™ occasionally updates its styling which may break DF Tube.\n\nREGARDING PRIVACY\nI do not read, examine or track your browser history or any other personal information.  The only permissions I ask for are \"tabs\" to insert the functionality and \"storage\" to store your settings.  I am a strong believer in privacy.  This extension is just a tool to help remove the distracting elements from YouTube™.\n\nThe permissions used by this extensions are 1) Storage - to store your preferences, 2) Tabs - to load the DF Tube script on each YouTube™ tab you open, and 3) https://api.mailgun.net/* domain - which is a service I use to send your feedback to my email.\n\n***\n\nYouTube™ is directly incentivized to create as many views and ad clicks as possible.  As a result we are inundated with tasty thumbnails and advertisements from every angle.  While this is good for someone looking to kill time, it's not so good for those of us intending to focus on educational content, do research, or simply find some relaxing music to groove to.\n\nAfter using DF Tube for a few days, you realize the extent to which the pattern of click, watch, scan mindlessly for a new video, click, watch, and repeat, has been ingrained in us by YouTube™'s design.  DF Tube breaks that cycle.\n\nBy default, DF Tube disables autoplay, hides the video recommendations sidebar as well as the related videos that appear at the end of videos.  It also removes the grid of recommended videos that appear on your homepage.  These settings are all configurable.  It can also hide comments and disable playlists sitewide.\n\nI hope DF Tube allows you to focus on the content *you* want to focus on.  Give it a try and be sure to report any suggestions or bugs!\n\n\n***UPDATES*** (11/18/2019)\n- Fixed issue where feed shows for a moment before being hidden"
