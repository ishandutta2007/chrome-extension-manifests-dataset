Unlike standard screenshot tools that capture only the visible area, this feature scrolls through the page automatically, stitching together a complete image of the entire content, perfect for long articles, comprehensive reports, or detailed web pages.\n\nü§ñ Custom Application Logic for ChatGPT (Premium Feature) \nRecognizing the dynamic and interactive nature of ChatGPT, the plugin offers specialized logic to capture the conversational flow and ensuring that the screenshots represent the full dialogue exchange.\n\nüìä Enhanced Support for Grafana Dashboards (Premium Feature) \nFor Grafana users, the plugin provides tailored functionality to capture complex data visualizations. It adjusts to various Grafana dashboard layouts and ensures that all elements are fully rendered before capturing. This is particularly useful for professionals needing to share or archive detailed data visualizations.\n\nüêõ Optimized for Jira Interfaces (Premium Feature) \nThe plugin is optimized for Jira, accommodating its dynamic web interface. It captures agile boards, backlogs, and detailed issue views, making it a valuable tool for project management and reporting. This feature is especially beneficial for teams needing to document and share project statuses or track issue histories.\n\nüöÄ Premium for Free\nEven free users (with or without account) can consume a limited amount of premium scrollshots.\n\nüëª Secure and Privacy-Conscious Design\nPrivacy and security are paramount. Screenshots are generated and saved on your local machine. There is no hidden cloud upload. Google Analytics is used for collecting information about how Scrollshot is used, but no personally identifiable data is collected.\n\nPremium Features might change if the supported websites change the structure of their pages."
