For both vacation rentals and hotels.\n\nDirect contact means that guests can get the full details of the accommodation and ask any questions direct to the owner. Asking those questions to a call-center doesn't help one bit! \n\nFor the accommodation provider, it means getting to know your guests before they arrive and building trust.\n\nFor owners and guests, it means avoiding fees and commission that typically add 20% to the cost of renting or at least 15% to the cost of booking a hotel room.\n\nThe middlemen (Online Travel Agent) sites are waging an ugly advertising war and the guests end up paying! With StaySavr, we are actively discouraging the advertising war by refusing to pay for it.\n\nOne day, sanity will return to the market and the OTAs will return to being advertising platforms. Until then... there is StaySavr+\n\nNew update November 2023: For many months, the extension only worked marginally on hotel sites. Now, that has been fully fixed and Orbitz.com and Agoda.com have been added. Contact information is shown for about 90% of hotels."
