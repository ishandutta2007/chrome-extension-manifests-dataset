We can use the token management function to view the tokens we are following and understand the current token market. At the same time, we can also use this plugin for virtual currency transactions. However, due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, please pay attention to whether the recipient is correct when transferring. If it is a face-to-face transaction, it is best. We provide the recipient with a payment QR code, and the transferor can directly transfer by scanning the QR code.\n\nWe also provide a transfer history function to facilitate users to view each transaction record, view each transaction time, transaction partner wallet address, transaction amount, and so on;\n\n\n\nPlease read all of our features here: https://pandawallet.pro\n\nFor support, please send an email to: pandacrypot@gmail.com"
