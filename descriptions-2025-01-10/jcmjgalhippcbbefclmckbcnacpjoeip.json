Pin the extension to easily request a theme for your favorite sites, but otherwise, this is an install-and-forget extension that improves your daily viewing experience.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n\n- We do not collect any user information whatsoever.\n- We do not sell anything - to you, or any other party.\n\n\nSuggested Use:\n\nRetheme operates in a very different way from traditional ad-blockers, therefore we recommend using it WITH one of those.  They block many 3rd-party scripts, speeding up the overall page load, while Retheme *only* tackles the visual layer, but can improve layout issues, remove gaps, etc.  They both have their uses, so run both!"
