It's a bit of a pain, I know, but I haven't found another way yet.\n\nEver seen people type those more detailed smiley faces and the table-flip meme with those strange characters and wanted to be able to easily make your own? This extension provides a simple, easy-to-use way of creating your own Unicode emoticons which you can then simply copy-and-paste into your post, allowing for more detailed expressions in your text!\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- You can now save custom emoticons and then load them as custom buttons the next time you use the plugin!\n- Fixed the question mark buttons (removed them as they were also playing up for me as well)\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 38 unique Unicode characters\n- Completely customisable typing\n- Copy to clipboard button\n- Customisable font size\n- Resizable text area\n\nIf you enjoy this app, it would be greatly appreciated if you could take the time to rate it!"
