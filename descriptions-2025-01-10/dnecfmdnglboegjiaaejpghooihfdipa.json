Thumbs down to Grooveshark for requiring one without letting anybody know.\n- Added ability to copy links to clipboard with one click in the extension\n\nv 1.19\n- Remembers urls you've saved/faved and highlights them when they show up in your search results again\n- Recently Saved now gives you the option to click through and see ALL your saved items\n- Created faves page so you can see all your listings in one place, will add pagination when someone complains about it :P\n- Unfaving an item on the 'Recently Saved' section or faves page will fade it out from view. Thought it'd be a good idea to give the user some visual feedback on their UI action.\n\nv 1.18\n- minor edit to make sure the extension doesn't have access to your browsing history\n- fixed minor bug\n\nv 1.16\n- Allows you to save/bookmark songs for future reference, so you don't have keep running the same search over and over. Just click on the yellow star again to unsave an item\n- Allows you to see read the TinySong FAQ page without leaving the extension \n- Changed the layout of results\n\npre v1.16\n- Saves your last search so you can repeat with a single mouse click\n- Selects your search term after a search so you can immediately run another search without reaching for the mouse\n- Returns your result and allows you to fetch more (+ more link) if you need\n\n\n[Notes]\n- I tried to have 'Copy To Clipboard' option, but Flash 10 has broken all the plugins/scripts that provide this functionality in javascript. Zero Clipboard would have been an option,"
