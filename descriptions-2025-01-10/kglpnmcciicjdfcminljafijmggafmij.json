It's that simple.\n\nI made this tool for ease of my usability as I had to manually prepend multiple links many times a day.\n\nI do not intend to add any new features to it, just publishing it to remove the annoying \"Turn off developer mode\" warning every time I open my chrome.\nThank you for using or not, whatever.\n\nIcon made by www.freepik.com from www.flaticon.com"
