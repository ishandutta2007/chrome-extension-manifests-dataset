Using this extension, when you view recipes on the Cookidoo.com.au website you will be able to see what ingredients you already have.\n\nOn your Cookidoo shopping list you can quickly determine what items you don't need to buy.\n\nWhen removing items from your Cookidoo shopping list you will be given the option to deduct those ingredients from your LARDA managed pantry.\n\nWhen at the supermarket, use the LARDA website to quickly check what items you have at home.\n\nWHY USE LARDA?\n\nSometimes when looking at recipes you can be discouraged when looking at the large or obscure ingredients list.  Using the LARDA extension you can already see at a glance that you have a number of the ingredients already, so you may be more likely to cook it.\n\nAre you like me and end up with 2 or 3 of the same thing in your pantry because you forget you have it?  LARDA can save you money by reminding you at PODD (Point of Delicious Decision).\n\n#Thermomix"
