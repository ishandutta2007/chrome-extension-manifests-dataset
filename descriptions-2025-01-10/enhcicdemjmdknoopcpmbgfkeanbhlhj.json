This tool gives you a clear visual representation of your company's runway, or in other words, the amount of time left before your capital runs out given your daily expenses.\n\nThe intention behind this plugin is to provide a stark reminder and powerful motivator for those running a business. By displaying the 'death clock', we hope to inspire entrepreneurs to work proactively, allocate resources wisely, and stay on top of their financial situation.\n\nTo use Startup Death Clock, simply input your daily expenses and current capital into the form provided. The extension will then calculate the number of days left and display this in a prominent countdown clock every time you open a new tab. This tool is perfect for any stage of a startup, whether you're in the early bootstrap phase, seeking funding, or in the growth stage."
