On this page, click on the extension in the toolbar, and click generate, and the program will download a text file with the LaTeX code for the test and all images from the test.\nImportant notes (read before using):\n - Currently does not support conversion of scilympiad math to LaTeX, but you can either format manually or copy the math from the scilympiad editor. \n - This extension isnâ€™t perfect and will need modifications such as page breaks or image size adjustments to be added to the files it generates, so you probably need at least a little LaTeX knowledge to use this extension. \n - Keep all settings as the default unless you really know what you are doing because the defaults are both most tested and adequate for most use cases. Other settings are for edge cases that might appear or personal preference (in the case of the environment for question types)\n - This extension truncates point values (e.g. 1.5 points turns into 1 point) because the exam class does not support decimal point values like this. Therefore, if your test includes decimal point values, you will have to manually change them in some way.\n - Please credit me in some way if you use the extension (this request is as of 2025, so if you used it in the past, don't think that you missed this). This extension doesn't add any watermarks or similar, as I tried to make an extension that is as useful to others as possible, so I would appreciate some form of crediting, such as a small note on the test or site. Additionally, please send an email to me or leave a review with any feedback. I read everything I receive and try to fix anything within a few months."
