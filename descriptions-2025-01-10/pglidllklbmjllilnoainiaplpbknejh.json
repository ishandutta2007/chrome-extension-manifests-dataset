This chrome plugin will allow testers, developers and product managers to create a punch-list for each app and release so they can manage issues in testing before they make it to production.  The backend will then allow you to automatically send those to market place developers to get quotes on fixing them, or directly to your GitHub issue backlog if you accept the issue and are ready to fix it."
