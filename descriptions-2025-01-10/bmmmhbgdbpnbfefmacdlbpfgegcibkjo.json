Using password manager is better, but if you lose your database, or need a password away from your computer, you are in trouble.\n\nThe best solution is generated passwords.\nEvery time you need a password, it is generated for you based on your master password and the website domain name.\nIf you need to access the website on a different computer, just use the same master password and the generated password will be the same.\n\nWhy use this over the original SuperGenPass?\n============================================\nMost importantly, SuperGenPass bookmarklet is absolutely insecure. Any website can steal your master password.\nThis extension is secure. But it's also more convenient.\nYour passwords are generated instantly on a press of a single key.\n\nWhy trust the extension?\n==================\nThe privacy policy is available in the codebase:\nhttps://github.com/denis-sokolov/chrome-supergenpass/blob/master/PRIVACY.md\n\nThe extension is completely open source and you can easily review all it does.\nIf you do not understand programming, remember that there are many who do and who review the code they install, so this extension would already be banned by Google if it was evil.\n\nChangelog\n========\n6. Settings synchronization, fix framed websites, snappier UI, remove page action icon.\n5. Whitelist support and prettier UI. Big parts of the code rewritten.\n4.1. Minor cleanup, updated jQuery for speed.\n4.0. Renamed from ChromeGenPass, since that violated Google Branding Guidelines.\n3.2. Fixed a bug when password length was less than 3 or more than 24.\n3.1. Added \"fill with password\" in page popup.\n3.0. Add a page action popup. It allows customized password generation as well as unlocking a password without entering it publicly.\n2.1. Popups do not prevent clicking on things below. Warning about wrong layout added. Many small fixes.\n2.0.2. Fixed huge security issue.\n2.0.1. Fixed small bug where update text was not displayed.\n2.0. Help added. Icon changed to a Crystal Clear set icon.\n1.9. Pre-release of 2.0. Security issue is fixed, now you enter the master password only in private popup.\n1.0.2. Fixed bugs, where ChromeGenPass has been breaking key support on other pages, such as RememberTheMilk. Now should work perfectly fine."
