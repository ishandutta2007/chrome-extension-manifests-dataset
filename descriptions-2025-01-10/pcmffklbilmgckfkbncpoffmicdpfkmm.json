For any issues or feature requests, visit https://github.com/dsp05/overleaf-copilot/issues or directly shoot me an email. It supports the following features:\n\n- Content Suggestions: It's triggered when you type a space at the end of a line, or when you press \"Enter\" to start a new line. Press \"Tab\" to accept the entire suggestion, or Ctrl/Command + \"Right Arrow\" to accept the next word.\n- Content Rewriting: Select a piece of text and click the pencil icon to rewrite it. You have full control of all actions and prompts in the toolbar.\n- Relevant Content Search from arXiv: Select a piece of text and click the search icon.\n\nYou can use it without providing your own OpenAI API key. The free server is just to give you an idea of how it works. Requests are rate-limited, and custom configurations are unavailable.\n\nIt is recommended to use your own API key for heavy usage. You can customize the prompts for suggestions and rewrites, use more advanced models, and access larger token limits. Your API key is stored in your browser and is never shared."
