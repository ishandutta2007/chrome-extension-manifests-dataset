This extension re-enables the backspace key as a back navigation button -- except if you're writing text.\n\nWhat's New in 3.0:\n==================\n* Updated to Manifest V3.\n\nBefore Chrome 52, the backspace key navigated back (if you weren't writing text). Many people lost their progress while working online by accidentally pressing backspace and leaving a page -- so we removed the feature from Chrome, and created this extension for those who prefer the old behavior.\n\nThis extension can't restore backspace on certain special pages, for example any of the \"chrome://\" pages such as Settings or Extensions.\n\nAbout the requested permissions:\n\n\"Read and modify all your data\": In order to capture backspace on every page, the extension needs to install a little piece of code on each one. It does nothing else with the page, its information, or your typing.\n\n\"Manage your apps, extensions, and themes\": This lets the extension detect when it has been re-enabled and install its code into tabs that are already open then.\n\nThe extension's source code can be viewed at\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/extensions-by-google/+/master/go-back-with-backspace/\n\nBy installing this item, you agree to the Google Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/."
