Built to provide an additional line of defense for your digital communications, AI Phishing Assistant offers email scanning for Gmail to make your online life safer.\nHow does it work?\n 1. User opens an email in Gmail and clicks the AI Phishing Assistant button to analyze the contents of the email using artificial intelligence.\n 2. The user receives a risk evaluation for their email. AI Phishing Assistant will display the likelihood of it being a phishing scam, showing one of three risk levels: low, moderate, or high. \n 3. AI Phishing Assistant explains how it came to that decision. It searches for suspicious objects, and then it checks the language, links included in the email, the sender's name, their email address, and what the recipient is asked to do. If any of these aspects raise suspicions, it notifies the user.\n 4. The user takes action. After receiving the scan results, the user can double-check the email themselves and act accordingly: delete the email immediately, contact the sender via other channels, or carry on as usual.\n\nPhishing attacks are on the rise, luring you in and encouraging you to reveal personal information or trying to infect your device with malware. You don't always have time to think before you click — so let AI Phishing Assistant think for you. Protect your peace of mind without spending time on meticulous email inspections — get a thorough risk analysis of any email in seconds!\n\nAI Phishing Assistant currently only works on Gmail.\n\nApproved users only!\n\nThe extension is available for testing only to users who signed up for the waitlist. If you want to get access to AI Phishing Assistant, head over to labs.nordvpn.com, sign up, and wait for our email."
