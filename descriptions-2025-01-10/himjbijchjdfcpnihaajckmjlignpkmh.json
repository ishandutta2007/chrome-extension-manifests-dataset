In order for the casebook extension to function, you must select ALL SCOPES when adding your new API Client.\n- NAM: https://visibility.amp.cisco.com/#/settings/oauth\n- EU: https://visibility.eu.amp.cisco.com/#/settings/oauth\n- APJC: https://visibility.apjc.amp.cisco.com/#/settings/oauth\n\nThe Cisco Threat Response Casebook is a powerful and convenient tool provided by Threat Response for saving, sharing, and enriching your threat analysis. Use cases for tracking notes and other bits and pieces of information as you follow leads in Threat Response. You can add observables and notes as you pursue your quarry. \n\nAlong with the Casebook, you'll be able to find and inspect observables through the browser's context menu. Select text on a page, or select a single observable, open the context menu and choose the Cisco Threat Response menu option. The selection will be inspected for observables and you'll be presented with information and actions to help with your investigations.\n\nYou can also launch an investigation on a single observable quickly by typing \"ctr [space]\" in the URL bar then typing or pasting an observable."
