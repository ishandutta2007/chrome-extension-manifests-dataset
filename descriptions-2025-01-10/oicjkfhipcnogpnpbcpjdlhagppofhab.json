The Timevault network makes this possible by giving everyone in the world the power to exchange their time as currency. Time is earned by helping others with tasks and activities. The hours you collect by volunteering can then be used to hire other participants within the Timevault community for your own projects.\n\nTimevault is a community experiment which utilizes Bitcoin, Counterparty, and Blockchain technologies."
