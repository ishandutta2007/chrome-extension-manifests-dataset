You can click on the download link to transfer magnet links to your preferred torrent downloader application or use the right-click context menu to copy the link to the clipboard.\n\nKey Features:\n1. Automatically finds the fastest proxy server for each search.\n2. If the first search engine returns no results, the extension switches to other torrent search engines.\n3. The extension avoids loading scripts from the engines and only parses the HTML content for safety.\n\nFurthermore, the extension allows you to filter search results by selecting specific categories, and you can sort the results by name, date, number of leechers, or number of seeders.\n\nGitHub page: https://github.com/balvin-perrie/the-pirate-bay-torrent-search\n\n-- User Data Privacy\nWhen you enter a search query in the extension's popup, it is sent to one of the mirror pages provided by \"https://proxybay.page/\" (the server name is displayed in the log section of the popup). The results are then extracted from the destination page and shown exclusively by parsing the HTML content. Additionally, if the mirror supports the standard JSON API communication, the extension may bypass HTML parsing and internally generate magnet links using the provided HASH. This extension does not engage in any other server-side activities."
