You may also use it to auto-submit a Google Form that has been assigned to you in the Google Classroom.\n\nTo ensure that the Google Form submission occurs at the correct time, the user will manually input the form URL, as well as the starting and ending times.\nThe user may see the alarms they've set on the \"Alarms\" page.\n\nThe \"Find Form\" button on the \"Automatic\" Page allows the user to locate the corresponding Google Form connected with the Assignment on Google Classroom, which is auto-submitted after the timer expires.\nIf the Assignment does not have any google forms attached, the extension shows an error message.\n\nHope you find this extension helpful :)\nThis project is open-sourced at https://github.com/devlup-labs/auto-submit-quiz"
