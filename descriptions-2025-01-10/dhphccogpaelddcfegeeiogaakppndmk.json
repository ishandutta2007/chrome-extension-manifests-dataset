This automatically starts the conversation for you with up to 20 targeted potential prospects every single day.\n\nThen Pepper will transform your Messenger dashboard from Facebook into a CRM system where you can keep track of all of your Messenger conversations and know exactly where each prospect throughout your sales process.\n\nAnd to make everything even easier, you can also set up Canned Responses in Pepper.  Doing so allows you to simply click a button to enter a commonly used sentence, paragraph, phrase, or image.  This auto-fills your user input field so that you can edit and double-check the text before you send it!\n\nBottom line, Pepper is the world's best Executive Assistant for entrepreneurs that use (or would like to use) Facebook to get high-paying clients and a stream of leads directly into their Messenger inbox!"
