Install extension;\n2. Go to extensions shortcuts page (chrome://extensions/shortcuts) and re-configure keys combination for activation (if needed);\n3. Activate extension (Alt+W by default);\n4. Type directory or bookmark name (at least partially);\n5. Navigate by arrows and select required bookmark;\n6. Update active tab by pressing \"Enter\" or open new tab by \"Shift+Enter\".\n\nUI customization:\n1. Items font size;\n2. Active item font weight, color and pointer.\n\nUX customization:\n1. Searching algorithms;\n2. Bookmarks directory (all available or just some sub-directory);\n3. History max count and max age;\n4. Count of items per page;\n5. Items sorting algorithm;\n6. Opening of new tab occurs in the same tabs group (or not);\n7. Opening of new tab occurs as neighbor of active one (or not always);\n8. Autoclosing;\n9. Changelog automatic opening.\n\nTech features:\n1. No 3rd party libraries are in use - everything is made for purpose and from scratch;\n2. Code is covered by unit tests and e2e tests - quality matters;\n3. Automatically updated internal model of bookmarks directory provides really fast work;\n4. Internal model stored locally and it's not available for other extensions - it's secure;\n5. Bookmarks model and history items are available for download to make custom usage visualization or analytics;\n6. Options are synchronized between all extension instances for your Google account via Chrome Sync - it's comfortable.\n\nChangelog is embedded into extension or could be found here: https://github.com/vikian050194/warp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"
