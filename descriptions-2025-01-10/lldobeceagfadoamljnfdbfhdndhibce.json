That's why I created this simple extension - to make it more convenient to share an instagram image across the web.\n\nThis extension works especially well with Discord and slack, where you can copy the image link and paste it into the chat, and it will automatically convert the link to an image. Instagram's default share option is very unreliable. Sometimes it shows a preview, and sometimes it doesn't - making you have to click the link and go to instagram to view it.\n\nCurrently the functionality is only applied when viewing in feed mode or a single image. Does not support grid view as of yet.\n\nCommands: \nCtrl / CMD + left click = copy link to image\nShift + left click = open image in new tab"
