Do you find yourself looking through lots of \"screenshot\" type threads?  All those \"What's your wallpaper\" or \"Show off your homescreen\"?  Are you tired of clicking through page after endless page of posts just to look for the images?  If so then this app is for you!\n\nInstall the extension which will add a small icon in the top right corner of your browser and just go browsing XDA as you normally would.  When you find yourself on a thread with lots of images just click the new icon and a new tab will open that searches the thread for images and loads them dynamically.  \n\nNo more clicking through page loads, just scroll down and it'll fetch more images for you!\n\nLog bugs here: \nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=34943572\n\nNOTE: This is not an official plugin from XDA-Developers nor is it affiliated with the site in any form or fashion.\n\nChanges:\n\n3/16:\n     - New: Advanced option to fetch all images in a thread ( Warning: Will be slow on very large threads and or cause images to not load, added as a request.  Disable if it causes problems )\n     - Couple bug fixes"
