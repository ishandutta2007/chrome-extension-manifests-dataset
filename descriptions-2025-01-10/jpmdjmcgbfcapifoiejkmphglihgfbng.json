All of your scraping remains private.\n\nAlthough there are many other web scrapers available, they often use compressed/obfuscated JavaScript code that makes it difficult to verify the behavior of the extension. Additionally, your scraping data is often shared beyond your local computer. \n\nThis extension uses clear, simple JavaScript that you can read and verify yourself, and it does so without sharing any of the data associated with your scraping."
