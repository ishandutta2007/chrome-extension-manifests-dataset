Then, this Chrome Extension might come handy to you.\n\nQueryParamsBuilder will allow you to define key/value pairs of query params that you can apply to the url for every single browser tab.\n\nThe extension consists of two parts.\n\nAn options page where you will define params that will be available for all the tabs. You will set a description name and the key of the query string param.\n\nAll fields are editable and changes are auto-saved once the field loses it's focus.\n\nA popup page will open once you click the extension's button on the browser extension's toolbar. For every single tab you will have by default all the options that you defined in the options page.\n\nFor every single tab you can also add and delete specific params. Once you click the Apply Params button, the extension will apply those params that are checked from the popup page to the url and reload the page for you\n\nYou can also delete everything from the options page.\n\nNote that if you edit or delete a param from the options page it will apply those changes to the popup too. In that case if you have those params applied to any of the tabs you will need to delete them manually."
