You can now see the latest email in the thread as you type, without have to scroll up and down. This is especially loved by Outlook users who are used to the reverse chronological view.\n\nI developed this after I could not find any solution. After using it for a while, I have noticed a significant boost in email productivity ... no more scrolling for those long conversation threads!\n\nNOTE: Refresh/reopen the Gmail tab for the extension to start working."
