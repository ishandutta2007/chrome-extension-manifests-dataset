Using this add-on could save you time while you are browsing as it gives you quick access to all your downloaded items from the toolbar popup UI. Please note that what happens in the popup gets updated in the download library simultaneously and vice-versa. There are also several buttons for each item within the toolbar that have a tooltip title and are self-explanatory.\n\nIf you want to report bugs or have a feature request, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/download-manager.html)."
