So if you want to measure distances between elements on a website this is perfect. It doesn't really work with images because there the colors change a lot pixel to pixel.\n\n\n# Images & HTML Elements\n\nMeasure between the following elements: images, input-fields, buttons, videos, gifs, text, icons. You can measure everything you see in the browser.\n\n\n# Mockups\n\nYour designer handed you mockups as PNGs or JPEGs? Just drop them into Chrome, activate Dimensions and start measuring.\n\n\n# Keyboard Shortcut\n\nYou can start and stop dimensions with the ALT + D shortcut.\n\n\n# Area Boundaries\n\nWanna get the radius of a circle? Is text standing in your way? Press Alt to measure the dimensions of a connected area.\n\n\n# Open Source\n\nDimensions is Open Source and hosted on Github. Want to port it to Firefox? Go ahead and fork it. Pull requests are welcome! https://github.com/mrflix/dimensions"
