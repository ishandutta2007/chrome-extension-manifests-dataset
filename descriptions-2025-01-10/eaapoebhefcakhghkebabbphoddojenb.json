A visual bookmark manager.\n\nOther New Tab Page makers automatically use the (square “favicon”) icon, so why use the Grab-n-tab system?\n\n✔ Logos tend to be rectangular so naturally, letterbox shaped icons are more recognizable than their square counterparts.\n\n✔ You often want to link to specific *parts* of a website. Say you want to link to a specific YouTube channel, you can make a link with the branding of the channel rather than using the generic YouTube icon. You could even make a collection of links to individual YouTube videos and have each link be an image from the video itself.\n\n✔ Small local websites often do not have a favicon and so the automated systems will offer you generic icons like a colored square to represent the site. With Grab-n-tab you can grab the site’s proper logo in just a few seconds.\n\nGrab-n-tab also features multiple pages, folders, customisable backgrounds, sticky notes and the ability to add both labels and detailed notes to icons. The notes can optionally be displayed as icon \"tooltips\", turning Grab-n-tab into a powerful research tool.\n\nWorks on all Chrome-based browsers like Edge, Brave, Vivaldi etc.\n\nImport/export of all data so you can make backups as well as transfer from one device to another.\n\n** NEW ** Import/export of individual Grab-n-tab folders.\n\nLimited version free forever. Upgrade for unlimited use."
