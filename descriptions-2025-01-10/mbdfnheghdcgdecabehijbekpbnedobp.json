The player controls a dot, square, or object on the playing board. It creates a trail behind it as it goes ahead, mimicking a snake.\n\nHow to Play: \nMove around with the arrow keys and eat the dots. Avoid crushing yourself.\n\nHistory:\nWorm, the earliest known home computer version, was created in 1978 by Peter Trefonas on the TRS-80 computer.\n\nTechnical Note:\nThis extension uses a WebAssembely built on the snake, and it is optimized to run in the popup area. The extension runs in a sandboxed environment, and it works completely offline. Visit the FAQs page for more info."
