A new text control type for the slate-editor is available. \n3. The content script is now programmatically injected.\n4. The text control requests are now handled through the scripting API.\n5. The manifest has new permissions added.\n6. The hosts permission has been added.\n\n[v23.8.1]\n1. General clean-up.\n2. Added expanded support for document native commands for content editable DIVs.
