You can track as many projects as you want! \n\n- Simple yet concise list containing number of backers, days left, goal and funded amount so far for each project.\n- Colored progression bar to easily see which ones are getting there.\n- Data is updated every 5 minutes.\n- Icon 'badge' (little number on the extension icon) that let you know how many of your tracked projects got more funding.\n- When opening the extension popup when the icon badge is active, the list will show how much more funding the project got since the last time you opened it.\n\nTO-DO:\n- Option to define the update interval.\n- Option to only show the badge if a minimum value was reached.\n- Option to show actual chrome notifications.\n- Option to play a little sound, maybe?"
