Unveiling AIâ€™s Quality and Reliability: \n\nSkeptic AI enables users to comprehend the quality and reliability of chat responses generated by Chat GPT. It serves as a powerful tool that enables individuals to assess the accuracy, validity, and credibility of AI-generated information, fostering a more discerning approach.\n\n2. Conscientizing about AI Biases: \n\nWhile AI proves immensely useful, it is not immune to the biases and pitfalls that afflict human beings. It too can perpetuate misinformation, contribute to echo chambers, lack of transparency, and fall short in representing diverse perspectives.\n\nBy recognizing the inherent biases within AI systems and highlighting the risks of unquestioning acceptance, Skeptic AI encourages individuals to explore diverse perspectives. It promotes critical thinking and encourages the consideration of alternative viewpoints, cultivating a more inclusive and well-rounded understanding.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Open Chat GPT at 'chat.openai.com'.\n2. Engage in a conversation on a complex/polarized subject.\n3. Activate Skeptic AI by clicking the extension icon at the top right corner of the browser.\n4. Play the Run button.\n5. Use the buttons to analyze Chat GPT's response. Explore Accuracy, Consistency, Transparency, Representativeness, Main Sources, Main Biases, Fake news, and more.\n\nFull credit of design inspiration from Teenage Engineering OP-1."
