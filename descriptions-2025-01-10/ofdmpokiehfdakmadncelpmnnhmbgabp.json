If you are a moderator, an \"approval checkmark\" will appear alongside any message, clicking the check will allow it to be visible to users in active mode.\nTo toggle modes, click the curtain icon to the left of the chat list icon.\nThis is a client-side behavior, meaning only people using the extension will see the effects of it.\n\nTo get started, install the extension and open the extension options, you can then log in and connect with twitch. Doing so will request your list of moderators and enable the ability to use the extension on your channel.\n\nOnly moderators of the channel can approve messages, they must log in with twitch in the extension settings\nModeration list is obtained by signing in (i.e. the channel owner must also log into the extension to enable it on their channel)\nA message with no text (just emotes) is always instantly approved\nMessages will appear in order of chatted, not in order of approval\nIdentical messages from the same user don't need to be approved again (steve says hi twice, it only approves once)\nDoesn't work when \"channel surfing\" (you need to directly load the page or refresh on the stream page)"
