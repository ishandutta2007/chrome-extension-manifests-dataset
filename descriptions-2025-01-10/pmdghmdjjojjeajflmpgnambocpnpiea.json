It uses the powerful algorithm of Night Eye to properly convert the Gmail theme into a smooth and eye-caring dark theme.\n\nWhy do you need Gmail dark mode?\nDark mode can reduce eye strain, allow you to be more productive, and,  most importantly, give you another layer of protection for your eyes. As we are spending more and more time in front of the screen, our eyes suffer the most from this. Obviously, there is no turning back; we will be spending most of our waking hours staring at screens. Thus something must be done to lift the heavy burden we are putting on our eyesight.\n\nThe fact is that we are sending more and more emails, and pretty much all communication is done via email. E-mail is one of those online activities that can literally eat up half of your day. This is why improving how you handle email is a good starting point to minimize the pressure you put on your eyes every day.\nDoes Gmail dark mode read my emails?\nAbsolutely not! The extension only analyzes the colors of your page and converts them. It does not read, process, store, or do anything with your content.\n\nCan I enable dark mode on other websites?\nGmail dark mode is specifically made for those who only want to have a dark theme on Gmail. To enable dark mode on any website, please check our other extension - Night Eye - www.nighteye.app\n\nOur website: https://nighteye.app/gmail-dark-mode\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/nighteye_ext\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/night.eye.extension"
