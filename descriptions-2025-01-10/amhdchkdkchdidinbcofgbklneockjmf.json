Pitchfork changed a bunch of their html markup so some parts of this stopped working. It should be mostly functional again.*\n\nSpotifork adds little links to the Pitchfork website that allow you to immediately jump to a Spotify search. Spotifork creates one link that jumps directly to the artist and another that jumps directly to the album.\n\nSpotifork does NOT check Spotify before creating these links, so many searches may yield no results. Still, this is the fastest way to see if stuff reviewed on Pitchfork is available on Spotify!"
