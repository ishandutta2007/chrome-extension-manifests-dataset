This option is selected by default when installing the extension. \n\n(Note: I added this due to the fact that manually setting your GMT offset has the pesky side effect of forcing you to change the offset whenever the selected timezone enters or leaves daylight savings time, or else the extension's output would be incorrect.)\n\nv2.0.3\n * Added \"Input Date Order\" option\n * Fixed a bug causing the omnibox and context menu features not to respect changes made in the Options during the same browser session\n * Height of the extension pop-up now properly adjusts to fit the contents when changing tabs.\n\nv2.0.2\n * Re-added and tweaked extensions's omnibox functionality from v1.x. Type \"ut\" in Chrome's Omnibox (location bar) and press Tab to start interacting with Utime. From here, you can enter a date or timestamp and then press Enter to get the converted value in a prompt dialog.\n * Updated the error text displayed when a value cannot be converted\n * Removed some unnecessary javascript assets from the extension's pop-up \n\nv2.0.1\n * Added back the feature from v1.x where pressing Enter while the input box is empty (and either \"Auto-detect\" or \"Date\" is selected) will output the the timestamp for the current date and time (aka \"now\")\n * Added additional date output format options, \"d.m.yyyy\" and \"m.d.yyyy\", as well as two digit year variants for all the available shorthand date formats.\n\nv2.0\n * Complete revamp of the extension, focused on increasing the ease of use, and allowing the user to better customize it to their needs through the additional options (base timezone, timestamp unit, ect.).\n\n\nv1.2.2\n * Updated extension permissions (Removed several permissions that were unintentionally left in from a dev version, but are not needed).\n\nv1.2\n * Added an Options page for the extension (accessible via either right clicking the extension icon and selecting \"Options\" or clicking the \"gear\" icon in the Utime pop-open window.\n * In Options you can now set an Hour offset (positive or negative) which will be applied to all conversion results.\n * Updated the Omnibox interface to the extension. Conversions done from the omnibox are now processed on-the-fly as you type and displayed directly in the suggestions dropdown box. Once you are finished typing a timestamp or date into the box, just hit the down arrow to select your desired conversion result.\n * Added Shortcut: Typing \"ut [Tab] now\" in the omnibox will now give you the current timestamp.\n\nv1.1.1\n * Updated extension icon\n\nv1.1\n * Textboxes in the pop-open dialog now allow keyboard shortcut commands (cut, copy, paste, ect.)\n * State of the pop-open window is now saved when closed and re-opened\n * Clicking \"Convert\" for either the timestamp field or human date fields in the pop-open dialog when the fields are empty will now use the current date."
