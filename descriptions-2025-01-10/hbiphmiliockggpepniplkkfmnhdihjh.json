Type “fix grammar” to correct your sentence.\n- Translation. You can easily translate your text into other languages. For example, type “translate to french my name is Nick”\n- Recipes. Create a cocktail recipe from the ingredients you have.\n- Any other request. Do you need a movie recommendation? Don’t you know how a refrigerator works? Do you need a step-by-step guide on how to achieve something? Just type that, and GPT-3 will cover you!"
