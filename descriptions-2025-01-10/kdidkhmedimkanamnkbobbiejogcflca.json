If a bet is active with those options.\n\nIt automatically gets each bets options and puts them into a list to block which then resets when the bet ends ready for the next bet.\n\nYou will still see instruction messages from Swiftsbot like \"starting betting, whisper swiftsbot or put in chat: \"ckay 60\" or \"swift 60\" to bet 60 on that option\". \n\nThis means you can still see what to bet, if you want to bet whilst using the extension. When you type \"win 100\" for example and send the message, you will not see it in chat but don't worry it will still of counted.\n\nPlease let me know any suggestions and see you in chat!"
