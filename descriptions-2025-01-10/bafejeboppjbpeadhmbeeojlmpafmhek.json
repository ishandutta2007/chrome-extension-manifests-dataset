This is what you'll get by installing this extension:\n\n1. All of disabled spam messages will be hidden in admin dashboard.\n2. In admin dashboard, you'll see the threads of each forum as a tab. This way you don't need to scroll to the end of the page to see new posts in each forum.\n3. It will highlight forum threads which are most likely spams and are not removed yet.\n4. It will highlight forums threads without any replies. These are most probably the threads that you need to take care of them.\n5. It will show other disabled threads in gray to don't let them distract you anymore."
