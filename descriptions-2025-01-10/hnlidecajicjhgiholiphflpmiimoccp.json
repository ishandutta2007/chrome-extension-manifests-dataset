This page also specifies which voice commands are available to you.\n - after that, you're ready to navigate the web without your mouse and keyboard!\n\nDemos:\n - Reading a news article and retweeting it: https://youtu.be/40zUF6EQlds\n - Writing and sending an email through outlook: https://youtu.be/5tHqg0gkcto\n - Watching and commenting a youtube video: https://youtu.be/jklxHEjbmfI\n - Online shopping at amazon: https://youtu.be/qdDpNSJD4JY\n\nYou can find more about our tool by reading a paper we wrote about it:\n - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhhAQds5F-yn3ngyKVFs2kSE7fUJ4fO7/view?usp=sharing\n\nFeel free to contact voxulus@gmail.com for any question!"
