Choosing finish, the screenshots automatically are imported into a Google Slides presentation. One screenshot per slide. Slides presentation can be found in the Google Drive SlideShot folder. Suggestion to use the \"Recent\" filter in Drive to locate quickly.\n\nStudents are able to use this Chrome extension to create a presentation of their work while utilizing web tools. Each slide has room for students to add a text box to explain their thinking and learning. Google Classroom users: Students can choose \"Add\" to add the Slides presentation from Google Drive to their assignment.\n\nSpecial thanks to Wanda Terral for her support in developing these Chrome extensions."
