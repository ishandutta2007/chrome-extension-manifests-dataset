In addition, our stock of well-preserved vintage issues (and the accompanying supplies to keep them looking their best) will take you back to a lost age in the world of pulp fiction.\n\nOf course, our long heritage in the numismatic community is well represented at Edmonton Comics. Fans of household names like Star Trek, Looney Tunes, Batman, Superman & more can find collectible keepsakes that will last generations."
