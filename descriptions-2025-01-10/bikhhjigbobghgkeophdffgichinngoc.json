College and university admissions offices search the web to determine who gains admission. Consumers use Google to make decisions about what sites to make purchases from. If there is negative information about you or your business on the web — whether factual or erroneous — you could easily lose out on a getting a job, or getting admitted to school, or your business could lose sales.\n\nIf there are negative, reputation-hurting forum posts or comments, pictures, videos, or news articles about you or your company, you need to be proactive and make that web content less accessible to anyone searching for your name or your company's name.\n\nFix Your Search Results has been involved in online reputation management (ORM) for over 8 years. We know exactly what steps to take to clean up the online reputation of both individuals and businesses. \n\nNegative search results can ruin your reputation, result in being excluded from a job you're otherwise qualified for, and cause the loss of online sales for those who sell on the web. Unfortunately, actually removing negative information from a website that you don't control is almost impossible.\n\nThe best solution to negative search results is to push the bad results down from the first pages of search engine results. Over 90% of people who run searches don't look beyond the first page of a search result. Over 95% of searches don't look past the first two pages of results. That's why online reputation management is so important to both individuals and businesses. Our proven techniques move negative search results off the first and second pages of search results, essentially moving them beyond the eyes of most searchers. \n\nWhat Fix Your Search Results Does\n\nWe work with our partner web hosting company MadBeeTech to gain access to numerous existing sites to which we post favorable content that quickly appears in search engine results.\n\nFix Your Search Results registers new domains with relevant keywords (including your name if applicable) in the URLs, then applies search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to these sites.\n\nOur company posts numerous blog and forum entries, articles, and other site entries that all reference you or your business in a positive light — thereby creating a steady stream of positive content to be indexed by Google, Bing, and other search engines.\n\nWhere applicable, we will work with site owners of sites that currently display negative information about you in an attempt to actually remove the negative information from those sites."
