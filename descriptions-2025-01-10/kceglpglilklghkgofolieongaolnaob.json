Moreover, you can set the addon to remove cookies for all tabs when the browser is closed (Session-Only mode).\n\nThe toolbar icon serves as an ON|OFF switch to quickly turn the addon ON or OFF. This addon can potentially improve your privacy as it deletes cookies (and most importantly third-party cookies) which are used to track user's behavior across multiple websites. Please note that, if you want to switch modes, open the addon options and mark the desired option. Moreover, this addon has a whitelisting tool to easily exclude a domain from Cookie Auto Delete. Simply add a domain comma separate to the designated area on the options page.\n\nNote: this extension is made in collaboration with the author of Cookie Switch ON|OFF (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-switch-onoff/okclohaghlaedgghhngcenaandmajmmk)\n\nTo report bugs, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/cookie-auto-delete.html)."
