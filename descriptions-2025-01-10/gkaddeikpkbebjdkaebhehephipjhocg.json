Or maybe you're as quiet as a mouse? 🙊  Whether your mouth’s too big or too small, Talk-o-meter is here to help. It's a simple concept - track and compare how much you and others talk in Google Meet.🗣️\n \nHow to use:\n  ✓ Install the Extension\n  ✓ In your next Google Meet conference, you'll see some talk statistics\n  ✓ Try to keep your talk time close to the group average\n \nOrigin:\n \nTalk-o-meter was found at the end of a rainbow and initially developed one sunny day by a talkative unicorn. Well, close, it was developed by the boss of a tech company who had the not too admirable superpower of talking too much on Google Meet.🤦‍♂️ When COVID-19 hit, the entire company realised that they were spending many hours each day on conference calls talking and talking and talking.😩  \n \nIt was then the crushing realisation hit - maybe, just maybe, the boss was talking too much, reducing the ability for others to contribute and feel heard in meetings. 🤷\n \nAfter moving rapidly from denial to acceptance in the grief cycle, the boss thought, “What if there was a way for everyone to measure and monitor how long they speak on all web calls?” 🤔\n \nHow it works:\n\nTalk-o-meter tracks the number of seconds each participant talks in Google Meet and displays information in real-time, including:\n  * Your rank (e.g. 1st, 2nd...)\n  * An indicator if you're above or below the group average\n  * The percentage of time you've talked in the meeting\n \nFor example, if you see \"1st ^ 67%\", that means you talk the most (ranked 1st), and are 67% above average. Hover your mouse over the number, and you'll see some more statistics including the percentage of time you've spoken in the meeting. A negative/minus number indicates your below average and maybe should offer a thought provoking opinion, or a long joke 😁\n \nBenefits:\n \nOne of the strong predictors of an effective meeting (100% scientifically proven by the way) is that all participants contribute... Sorry, boss. 🤬 Talk-o-meter aims to rid the world of crappy meetings, one meeting at a time. It starts with downloading Talk-o-meter and sharing it with your team.🙌\n \nTalkometer is free to download (and open source) and far more hygienic than putting a sock in your mouth.🧦 \n\nIf you’ve been sent this link by a friend (hint, hint), download it today and begin encouraging more voices to be heard within your team. \n \nTalk-o-meter is a Chrome Browser Extension that is only active when you're using Google Meet (A Google Meet Add-on). Privacy is assured and all talk time tracking statistics are visible to you and you only. It does not gather usage stats, nor does it track your conversations. It's a fantastic meeting tracker, but no warranty is provided and results may vary depending on the size of one's mouth 😬\n\nSource on Github: https://github.com/PaperCutSoftware/talk-o-meter  \n\nRelease History:\n\n2022-10-21 - Addressed a bug that prevented \"You\" from being tracked.  This was caused by a new Google Meet layout."
