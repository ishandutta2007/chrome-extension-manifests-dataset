Unfortunately I have gotten very used to having apps and websites dark themed, like many others, so I wanted to create an extension that allows other college students like myself to experience dark mode even on Coursicle.\n\nI hope you decide to download and use this extension, it really is simple but it is quite nice to have for those few weeks every semester when your visiting Coursicle daily!"
