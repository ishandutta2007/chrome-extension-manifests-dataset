To be clear, this is not verification.\nVurified will immediately remove any verified status for Twitter blue users (and give them a \"PHONY\" tag). Additionally, we'll vurify all the good Twitter users who don't pay $8/mo or are actually verified. This should clear up any perception that the verified check ever meant anything, as well as let you know which one of your friends wasted $8.\nWe cannot emphasize enough, we are not affiliated with Twitter or Elon Musk, in the same way we're not affiliated with a garbage fire and an eight hundred pound walrus.\n\nIf you like this extension, please consider leaving a review! If you don't like this extension, we pity you."
