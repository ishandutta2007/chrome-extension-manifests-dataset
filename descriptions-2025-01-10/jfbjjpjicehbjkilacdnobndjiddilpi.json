This extension works when opening up a new tab in Chrome. Once added and logged in with your askSpoke credentials, you’ll be able to:\n\n• File a request\n• View popular request types and file requests directly\n• View popular resources\n\nWe look forward to you giving it a try! Your feedback is extremely valuable to us as we continue to build upon our V1 release. We’d love to hear what other functionalities you’d like to see in a browser extension.\n\nTo get access to the extension, simply install by clicking the “Add to Chrome” button above. You’ll be able to access it every time a new tab opens."
