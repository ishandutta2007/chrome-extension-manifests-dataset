Not fully supported yet. And save!\n\n2. In your project on Overleaf, (!!important!!) make sure you are in your .bib file with the cursor located at where you want the paper's bibtex code to be inserted! \n\n3. Click this extension (or use key Ctrl+Shift+E), input the searching text and search. Just click whatever paper you want to insert in the .bib file, it will automatically insert the bibtex code. Note, you clipboard is also filled up with the same bibtex code.\n\nNew in version 3.2, enter key works fine and search histories (max number 5) are saved."
