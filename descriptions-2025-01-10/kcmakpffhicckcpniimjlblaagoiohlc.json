For example, if a goal states you must beat 5 levels to claim it, you can use the counter to keep track of how many you've beaten so far. It was created for PangaeaPanga.\nSimply hover over a bingo square to show the + and - buttons. Click them to change the value of the counter. The extension will remember the number on each square for a given room even if you refresh the page or close it and reopen it later (so long as it's the same room). To reset all the counters, simply right click and choose \"Reset all Bingosync counters\"."
