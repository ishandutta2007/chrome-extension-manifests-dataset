No time wasted. Relax. All planning is done for you.\n* 100 flashcards, 1,000 flaschards, 10,000 flashcards, more!\n \nBUBOFLASH IS SOCIAL\n* Annotate books together.\n* Share annotations, flashcards and even pdfs - if you choose to do so.\n* No conflicts anymore, everything is versioned, everybody can pick their \"version of truth\" :-)"
