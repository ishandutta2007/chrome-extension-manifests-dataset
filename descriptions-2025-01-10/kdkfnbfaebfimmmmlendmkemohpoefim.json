No external network requests. No analytics. No tracking. No bullshit.\n\nWhat?\n\nA minimalistic new tab page replacement for Chrome. Changes between light and dark mode automatically, depending on your device's setting. This empty new tab page fades in and is easy on your eyes.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. Default Chrome new tab page makes network requests and is cluttered with many UI elements\n2. Light and Dark New Tab requires minimal system resources; everything is contained in a single HTML file; not a line of JavaScript is loaded and is lightning fast.\n3. Light and Dark New Tab perfectly matches your device's setting ; it fades in perfectly with a blank new tab, that respects your choice of light or dark mode.\n4. I wanted to minimize distractions and soothe my OCD.\n5. I wanted to use the \"Dark New Tab\" extension across all my devices. But, I liked using light mode, and didn't like the dark grey on white look.\n\nSuggestions for Use and Issues:\n\nLight and Dark New Tab goes well with the default light and dark themes included with Chrome. If you are on Linux, and you want automatic light and dark mode changing such as in other platforms, like MacOS, I suggest using the latest GNOME desktop environment paired with this extension: \nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2236/night-theme-switcher/\n\n\nSource Code & Support:\n\nI currently use this extension on Linux, using the latest GNOME. (IMPORTANT!) Chrome *will NOT* switch between light and dark mode automatically on Linux without a GNOME extension such as this:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2236/night-theme-switcher/\nIf you have any issues using it on any other platforms, please post an issue this project's GitHub repo, linked below:\nhttps://github.com/OperationNorthwoods/lightanddarknewtab"
