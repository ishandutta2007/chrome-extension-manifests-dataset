Window\n===============\n\nToo many web pages take up resources? It's troublesome but you dare not turn it off, afraid that you won't be able to find it back?\nWith this function, you can save all tabs in the current window and name them.\nNext time, you can find and open the window through search to restore the original web page, and no longer have to worry about too many pages and take up resources.\nIn addition, when the window changes, you can also use \"Reset\", \"Update\", \"Bind\" and other operations to keep the window tidy.\n\n\n===================\n2.   Temporary Window\n===================\n\nYou may only use some web pages temporarily and do not open them frequently, but you currently want to make room for operating other windows.\nThe previous \"Window\" function is not suitable for use here, so there is a \"Temporary Window\" function.\nIt can also save all the web page addresses in the current window, and at the same time, it will automatically close the current window without naming it, thus quickly saving and closing the window.\nWhen you want to browse these webpages again, just click the corresponding \"Temporary Window\" to restore the previous webpage immediately, and this record will also be automatically removed from the list.\nWith this feature, you no longer need to open a bunch of web pages like before. Open whatever webpage you need to view, and receive it in the \"Temporary window\" if you don’t need it temporarily, no longer have to worry about too many pages and take up resources.\nIn addition, this extension also provides options such as \"Save the left tab\", \"Save only the current tab\", \"Save the selected tab\", etc., so you can do whatever you want.\n\n\n===============\n3.          Note\n===============\n\nThe two functions mentioned above are mainly aimed at windows. If we only want to record a tab (web page), it is actually not friendly to operate.\nDon't worry, my original \"Note\" function will bring you a brand new web browsing experience.\nAs the name suggests, the biggest feature of \"Note\" is convenience. You only need to tap the \"Note Save Button\" to complete the recording of the current web page without any other operations.\nAnd, when you want to remove the \"Note\", you only need to click the button again to complete it.\nAfter the web page is saved as a note, the two are automatically associated.\nYou can quickly switch to the \"Note\" you want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and you will be able to do more temporary tasks.\nWhen you no longer need the \"Note\", you can delete it, and its associated webpage will be automatically closed.\n\n\n===============\n4.      Active Tab\n===============\n\nThis shows all the currently opened webpages. We can quickly switch to the tab that we want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and we won't be in a hurry because of opening too many webpages.\nAnd the most recently visited webpage will be automatically displayed at the top of the list, you don’t even need to search, you can switch back and forth between multiple webpages by shortcut keys.\nIn addition, this extension also specially optimizes the headlines of the web pages. What you see in the list will be refreshing headlines, which will be restored to the original headlines only when you select or search.\n\n\n===============\n5.      Bookmark\n===============\n\nThere is a difference between \"Bookmark\" and \"Note\". \"Note\" is only temporary. \"Bookmark\" have a longer validity period and will be opened frequently.\nUnfortunately, Chrome’s built-in bookmark search is more troublesome. You need to search in a separate bookmark management page, which is very inefficient.\nSo this extension also adds a bookmark function.\nRelying on the powerful search function, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys of the extension itself, here \"Bookmark\" will also bring you a new experience.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n6.        History\n===============\n\nAlthough Chrome's built-in history function is good, it is still a bit inconvenient to open a new tab.\nSo this plugin has also been extended.\nSimilarly, relying on the powerful search function of the extension itself, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys, here \"History\" will also bring you a new experience.\nIn addition, this extension also groups the records of the same domain name, which will make it easier to read.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n7.      Search All\n===============\n\nThis is a separate \"Workspace\", although we can find \"Window\", \"Bookmarks\", \"History\", etc. through \"Workspace Switching\", but in \"Search All\", there is no need to perform \"Workspace Switching\".\nYou can query all content, greatly improving search efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also add a \"Search Engine\", when you can't find the content, you can select the appropriate \"Search Engine\" to search.\nYou can also perform operations such as \"top\", \"bottom\", and \"smart sorting\" on the \"work area\" in the \"Settings Center\" to personalize the search results.\n\n\n====================\n8.  Workspace Switching\n====================\n\nWith so many functions mentioned above, it is obviously impossible to display all the windows in one extension, so there is \"Workspace Switching\".\nThe Workspace here refers to the previous functions, and a function is a Workspace.\nYou can switch between Workspaces very flexibly through left and right selection on the keyboard, setting of shortcut keys in the Workspace, input \">\" in the search box, drop-down menus, indicators, etc.\nAnd the extension will record the current Workspace, and the Workspace shown last time will be displayed when it is started next time.\nYou can also \"pin\" a certain Workspace so that no matter what the current Workspace is, this Workspace will be opened next time you start it.\nYou may not use some functions, you can also disable them, so that this Workspace will no longer be displayed.\nAfter switching the Workspace, the corresponding Workspace will also automatically search according to the content of the input box without re-entering.\n\n\n===============\n 9.       Theme\n===============\n\nYou can set the height, font size, color, etc. of the list in \"Settings Center\". The extension itself provides up to 99 settings.\nBy saving the settings as \"Theme\", you can change the behavior and style of the extension very flexibly.\nThings like \"Sidebar\", \"Frosted Effect\", \"Highly Automated\" and so on are all.\nIn addition, there are \"Popup\" and \"Injection\" modes, \"Dark Mode\", \"Start Speed Modification\" and other functions.\n\n\n===============\n10       Keymap\n===============\n\nIn \"Settings Center - Help - Keymap\", you can get all the shortcut keys provided by this extension.\nThere are only a few commonly used shortcut keys, but there are different operations in different Workspaces, so hundreds of expanded functions can be easily controlled by shortcut keys, which greatly improves production efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also customize shortcut keys for some functions. Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12. Settings Center\n================\n\nAs you can see, this extension provides a lot of functions, but it does not necessarily meet everyone's needs.\nTherefore, \"Settings Center\" provides a lot of personalized settings, you can customize your needs here.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above is the detailed introduction of this extension, more features need you to discover.\nIf you think this extension is very good, or want to provide some suggestions, please leave a message in the comment area.\n╰(￣▽￣)╭",

If we only want to record a tab (web page), it is actually not friendly to operate.\nDon't worry, my original \"Note\" function will bring you a brand new web browsing experience.\nAs the name suggests, the biggest feature of \"Note\" is convenience.

What you see in the list will be refreshing headlines, which will be restored to the original headlines only when you select or search.\n\n\n===============\n5.      Bookmark\n===============\n\nThere is a difference between \"Bookmark\" and \"Note\". \"Note\" is only temporary. \"Bookmark\" have a longer validity period and will be opened frequently.\nUnfortunately, Chrome’s built-in bookmark search is more troublesome. You need to search in a separate bookmark management page, which is very inefficient.\nSo this extension also adds a bookmark function.\nRelying on the powerful search function, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys of the extension itself, here \"Bookmark\" will also bring you a new experience.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n6.

Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12.

Temporary Window\n===================\n\nYou may only use some web pages temporarily and do not open them frequently, but you currently want to make room for operating other windows.\nThe previous \"Window\" function is not suitable for use here, so there is a \"Temporary Window\" function.\nIt can also save all the web page addresses in the current window, and at the same time, it will automatically close the current window without naming it, thus quickly saving and closing the window.\nWhen you want to browse these webpages again, just click the corresponding \"Temporary Window\" to restore the previous webpage immediately, and this record will also be automatically removed from the list.\nWith this feature, you no longer need to open a bunch of web pages like before. Open whatever webpage you need to view, and receive it in the \"Temporary window\" if you don’t need it temporarily, no longer have to worry about too many pages and take up resources.\nIn addition, this extension also provides options such as \"Save the left tab\", \"Save only the current tab\", \"Save the selected tab\", etc., so you can do whatever you want.\n\n\n===============\n3.          Note\n===============\n\nThe two functions mentioned above are mainly aimed at windows. If we only want to record a tab (web page), it is actually not friendly to operate.\nDon't worry, my original \"Note\" function will bring you a brand new web browsing experience.\nAs the name suggests, the biggest feature of \"Note\" is convenience. You only need to tap the \"Note Save Button\" to complete the recording of the current web page without any other operations.\nAnd, when you want to remove the \"Note\", you only need to click the button again to complete it.\nAfter the web page is saved as a note, the two are automatically associated.\nYou can quickly switch to the \"Note\" you want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and you will be able to do more temporary tasks.\nWhen you no longer need the \"Note\", you can delete it, and its associated webpage will be automatically closed.\n\n\n===============\n4.      Active Tab\n===============\n\nThis shows all the currently opened webpages. We can quickly switch to the tab that we want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and we won't be in a hurry because of opening too many webpages.\nAnd the most recently visited webpage will be automatically displayed at the top of the list, you don’t even need to search, you can switch back and forth between multiple webpages by shortcut keys.\nIn addition, this extension also specially optimizes the headlines of the web pages. What you see in the list will be refreshing headlines, which will be restored to the original headlines only when you select or search.\n\n\n===============\n5.      Bookmark\n===============\n\nThere is a difference between \"Bookmark\" and \"Note\". \"Note\" is only temporary. \"Bookmark\" have a longer validity period and will be opened frequently.\nUnfortunately, Chrome’s built-in bookmark search is more troublesome. You need to search in a separate bookmark management page, which is very inefficient.\nSo this extension also adds a bookmark function.\nRelying on the powerful search function, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys of the extension itself, here \"Bookmark\" will also bring you a new experience.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n6.        History\n===============\n\nAlthough Chrome's built-in history function is good, it is still a bit inconvenient to open a new tab.\nSo this plugin has also been extended.\nSimilarly, relying on the powerful search function of the extension itself, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys, here \"History\" will also bring you a new experience.\nIn addition, this extension also groups the records of the same domain name, which will make it easier to read.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n7.      Search All\n===============\n\nThis is a separate \"Workspace\", although we can find \"Window\", \"Bookmarks\", \"History\", etc. through \"Workspace Switching\", but in \"Search All\", there is no need to perform \"Workspace Switching\".\nYou can query all content, greatly improving search efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also add a \"Search Engine\", when you can't find the content, you can select the appropriate \"Search Engine\" to search.\nYou can also perform operations such as \"top\", \"bottom\", and \"smart sorting\" on the \"work area\" in the \"Settings Center\" to personalize the search results.\n\n\n====================\n8.  Workspace Switching\n====================\n\nWith so many functions mentioned above, it is obviously impossible to display all the windows in one extension, so there is \"Workspace Switching\".\nThe Workspace here refers to the previous functions, and a function is a Workspace.\nYou can switch between Workspaces very flexibly through left and right selection on the keyboard, setting of shortcut keys in the Workspace, input \">\" in the search box, drop-down menus, indicators, etc.\nAnd the extension will record the current Workspace, and the Workspace shown last time will be displayed when it is started next time.\nYou can also \"pin\" a certain Workspace so that no matter what the current Workspace is, this Workspace will be opened next time you start it.\nYou may not use some functions, you can also disable them, so that this Workspace will no longer be displayed.\nAfter switching the Workspace, the corresponding Workspace will also automatically search according to the content of the input box without re-entering.\n\n\n===============\n 9.       Theme\n===============\n\nYou can set the height, font size, color, etc. of the list in \"Settings Center\". The extension itself provides up to 99 settings.\nBy saving the settings as \"Theme\", you can change the behavior and style of the extension very flexibly.\nThings like \"Sidebar\", \"Frosted Effect\", \"Highly Automated\" and so on are all.\nIn addition, there are \"Popup\" and \"Injection\" modes, \"Dark Mode\", \"Start Speed Modification\" and other functions.\n\n\n===============\n10       Keymap\n===============\n\nIn \"Settings Center - Help - Keymap\", you can get all the shortcut keys provided by this extension.\nThere are only a few commonly used shortcut keys, but there are different operations in different Workspaces, so hundreds of expanded functions can be easily controlled by shortcut keys, which greatly improves production efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also customize shortcut keys for some functions. Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12. Settings Center\n================\n\nAs you can see, this extension provides a lot of functions, but it does not necessarily meet everyone's needs.\nTherefore, \"Settings Center\" provides a lot of personalized settings, you can customize your needs here.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above is the detailed introduction of this extension, more features need you to discover.\nIf you think this extension is very good, or want to provide some suggestions, please leave a message in the comment area.\n╰(￣▽￣)╭",

Temporary Window\n===================\n\nYou may only use some web pages temporarily and do not open them frequently, but you currently want to make room for operating other windows.\nThe previous \"Window\" function is not suitable for use here, so there is a \"Temporary Window\" function.\nIt can also save all the web page addresses in the current window, and at the same time, it will automatically close the current window without naming it, thus quickly saving and closing the window.\nWhen you want to browse these webpages again, just click the corresponding \"Temporary Window\" to restore the previous webpage immediately, and this record will also be automatically removed from the list.\nWith this feature, you no longer need to open a bunch of web pages like before. Open whatever webpage you need to view, and receive it in the \"Temporary window\" if you don’t need it temporarily, no longer have to worry about too many pages and take up resources.\nIn addition, this extension also provides options such as \"Save the left tab\", \"Save only the current tab\", \"Save the selected tab\", etc., so you can do whatever you want.\n\n\n===============\n3.          Note\n===============\n\nThe two functions mentioned above are mainly aimed at windows. If we only want to record a tab (web page), it is actually not friendly to operate.\nDon't worry, my original \"Note\" function will bring you a brand new web browsing experience.\nAs the name suggests, the biggest feature of \"Note\" is convenience. You only need to tap the \"Note Save Button\" to complete the recording of the current web page without any other operations.\nAnd, when you want to remove the \"Note\", you only need to click the button again to complete it.\nAfter the web page is saved as a note, the two are automatically associated.\nYou can quickly switch to the \"Note\" you want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and you will be able to do more temporary tasks.\nWhen you no longer need the \"Note\", you can delete it, and its associated webpage will be automatically closed.\n\n\n===============\n4.

We can quickly switch to the tab that we want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and we won't be in a hurry because of opening too many webpages.\nAnd the most recently visited webpage will be automatically displayed at the top of the list, you don’t even need to search, you can switch back and forth between multiple webpages by shortcut keys.\nIn addition, this extension also specially optimizes the headlines of the web pages. What you see in the list will be refreshing headlines, which will be restored to the original headlines only when you select or search.\n\n\n===============\n5.      Bookmark\n===============\n\nThere is a difference between \"Bookmark\" and \"Note\". \"Note\" is only temporary. \"Bookmark\" have a longer validity period and will be opened frequently.\nUnfortunately, Chrome’s built-in bookmark search is more troublesome. You need to search in a separate bookmark management page, which is very inefficient.\nSo this extension also adds a bookmark function.\nRelying on the powerful search function, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys of the extension itself, here \"Bookmark\" will also bring you a new experience.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n6.

Search All\n===============\n\nThis is a separate \"Workspace\", although we can find \"Window\", \"Bookmarks\", \"History\", etc. through \"Workspace Switching\", but in \"Search All\", there is no need to perform \"Workspace Switching\".\nYou can query all content, greatly improving search efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also add a \"Search Engine\", when you can't find the content, you can select the appropriate \"Search Engine\" to search.\nYou can also perform operations such as \"top\", \"bottom\", and \"smart sorting\" on the \"work area\" in the \"Settings Center\" to personalize the search results.\n\n\n====================\n8.  Workspace Switching\n====================\n\nWith so many functions mentioned above, it is obviously impossible to display all the windows in one extension, so there is \"Workspace Switching\".\nThe Workspace here refers to the previous functions, and a function is a Workspace.\nYou can switch between Workspaces very flexibly through left and right selection on the keyboard, setting of shortcut keys in the Workspace, input \">\" in the search box, drop-down menus, indicators, etc.\nAnd the extension will record the current Workspace, and the Workspace shown last time will be displayed when it is started next time.\nYou can also \"pin\" a certain Workspace so that no matter what the current Workspace is, this Workspace will be opened next time you start it.\nYou may not use some functions, you can also disable them, so that this Workspace will no longer be displayed.\nAfter switching the Workspace, the corresponding Workspace will also automatically search according to the content of the input box without re-entering.\n\n\n===============\n 9.

Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.

The extension itself provides up to 99 settings.\nBy saving the settings as \"Theme\", you can change the behavior and style of the extension very flexibly.\nThings like \"Sidebar\", \"Frosted Effect\", \"Highly Automated\" and so on are all.\nIn addition, there are \"Popup\" and \"Injection\" modes, \"Dark Mode\", \"Start Speed Modification\" and other functions.\n\n\n===============\n10       Keymap\n===============\n\nIn \"Settings Center - Help - Keymap\", you can get all the shortcut keys provided by this extension.\nThere are only a few commonly used shortcut keys, but there are different operations in different Workspaces, so hundreds of expanded functions can be easily controlled by shortcut keys, which greatly improves production efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also customize shortcut keys for some functions. Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12. Settings Center\n================\n\nAs you can see, this extension provides a lot of functions, but it does not necessarily meet everyone's needs.\nTherefore, \"Settings Center\" provides a lot of personalized settings, you can customize your needs here.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above is the detailed introduction of this extension, more features need you to discover.\nIf you think this extension is very good, or want to provide some suggestions, please leave a message in the comment area.\n╰(￣▽￣)╭",

Temporary Window\n===================\n\nYou may only use some web pages temporarily and do not open them frequently, but you currently want to make room for operating other windows.\nThe previous \"Window\" function is not suitable for use here, so there is a \"Temporary Window\" function.\nIt can also save all the web page addresses in the current window, and at the same time, it will automatically close the current window without naming it, thus quickly saving and closing the window.\nWhen you want to browse these webpages again, just click the corresponding \"Temporary Window\" to restore the previous webpage immediately, and this record will also be automatically removed from the list.\nWith this feature, you no longer need to open a bunch of web pages like before.

If we only want to record a tab (web page), it is actually not friendly to operate.\nDon't worry, my original \"Note\" function will bring you a brand new web browsing experience.\nAs the name suggests, the biggest feature of \"Note\" is convenience.

Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize.

You only need to tap the \"Note Save Button\" to complete the recording of the current web page without any other operations.\nAnd, when you want to remove the \"Note\", you only need to click the button again to complete it.\nAfter the web page is saved as a note, the two are automatically associated.\nYou can quickly switch to the \"Note\" you want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and you will be able to do more temporary tasks.\nWhen you no longer need the \"Note\", you can delete it, and its associated webpage will be automatically closed.\n\n\n===============\n4.      Active Tab\n===============\n\nThis shows all the currently opened webpages. We can quickly switch to the tab that we want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and we won't be in a hurry because of opening too many webpages.\nAnd the most recently visited webpage will be automatically displayed at the top of the list, you don’t even need to search, you can switch back and forth between multiple webpages by shortcut keys.\nIn addition, this extension also specially optimizes the headlines of the web pages. What you see in the list will be refreshing headlines, which will be restored to the original headlines only when you select or search.\n\n\n===============\n5.      Bookmark\n===============\n\nThere is a difference between \"Bookmark\" and \"Note\". \"Note\" is only temporary. \"Bookmark\" have a longer validity period and will be opened frequently.\nUnfortunately, Chrome’s built-in bookmark search is more troublesome. You need to search in a separate bookmark management page, which is very inefficient.\nSo this extension also adds a bookmark function.\nRelying on the powerful search function, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys of the extension itself, here \"Bookmark\" will also bring you a new experience.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n6.        History\n===============\n\nAlthough Chrome's built-in history function is good, it is still a bit inconvenient to open a new tab.\nSo this plugin has also been extended.\nSimilarly, relying on the powerful search function of the extension itself, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys, here \"History\" will also bring you a new experience.\nIn addition, this extension also groups the records of the same domain name, which will make it easier to read.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n7.      Search All\n===============\n\nThis is a separate \"Workspace\", although we can find \"Window\", \"Bookmarks\", \"History\", etc. through \"Workspace Switching\", but in \"Search All\", there is no need to perform \"Workspace Switching\".\nYou can query all content, greatly improving search efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also add a \"Search Engine\", when you can't find the content, you can select the appropriate \"Search Engine\" to search.\nYou can also perform operations such as \"top\", \"bottom\", and \"smart sorting\" on the \"work area\" in the \"Settings Center\" to personalize the search results.\n\n\n====================\n8.  Workspace Switching\n====================\n\nWith so many functions mentioned above, it is obviously impossible to display all the windows in one extension, so there is \"Workspace Switching\".\nThe Workspace here refers to the previous functions, and a function is a Workspace.\nYou can switch between Workspaces very flexibly through left and right selection on the keyboard, setting of shortcut keys in the Workspace, input \">\" in the search box, drop-down menus, indicators, etc.\nAnd the extension will record the current Workspace, and the Workspace shown last time will be displayed when it is started next time.\nYou can also \"pin\" a certain Workspace so that no matter what the current Workspace is, this Workspace will be opened next time you start it.\nYou may not use some functions, you can also disable them, so that this Workspace will no longer be displayed.\nAfter switching the Workspace, the corresponding Workspace will also automatically search according to the content of the input box without re-entering.\n\n\n===============\n 9.       Theme\n===============\n\nYou can set the height, font size, color, etc. of the list in \"Settings Center\". The extension itself provides up to 99 settings.\nBy saving the settings as \"Theme\", you can change the behavior and style of the extension very flexibly.\nThings like \"Sidebar\", \"Frosted Effect\", \"Highly Automated\" and so on are all.\nIn addition, there are \"Popup\" and \"Injection\" modes, \"Dark Mode\", \"Start Speed Modification\" and other functions.\n\n\n===============\n10       Keymap\n===============\n\nIn \"Settings Center - Help - Keymap\", you can get all the shortcut keys provided by this extension.\nThere are only a few commonly used shortcut keys, but there are different operations in different Workspaces, so hundreds of expanded functions can be easily controlled by shortcut keys, which greatly improves production efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also customize shortcut keys for some functions. Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12. Settings Center\n================\n\nAs you can see, this extension provides a lot of functions, but it does not necessarily meet everyone's needs.\nTherefore, \"Settings Center\" provides a lot of personalized settings, you can customize your needs here.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above is the detailed introduction of this extension, more features need you to discover.\nIf you think this extension is very good, or want to provide some suggestions, please leave a message in the comment area.\n╰(￣▽￣)╭",

Temporary Window\n===================\n\nYou may only use some web pages temporarily and do not open them frequently, but you currently want to make room for operating other windows.\nThe previous \"Window\" function is not suitable for use here, so there is a \"Temporary Window\" function.\nIt can also save all the web page addresses in the current window, and at the same time, it will automatically close the current window without naming it, thus quickly saving and closing the window.\nWhen you want to browse these webpages again, just click the corresponding \"Temporary Window\" to restore the previous webpage immediately, and this record will also be automatically removed from the list.\nWith this feature, you no longer need to open a bunch of web pages like before. Open whatever webpage you need to view, and receive it in the \"Temporary window\" if you don’t need it temporarily, no longer have to worry about too many pages and take up resources.\nIn addition, this extension also provides options such as \"Save the left tab\", \"Save only the current tab\", \"Save the selected tab\", etc., so you can do whatever you want.\n\n\n===============\n3.          Note\n===============\n\nThe two functions mentioned above are mainly aimed at windows. If we only want to record a tab (web page), it is actually not friendly to operate.\nDon't worry, my original \"Note\" function will bring you a brand new web browsing experience.\nAs the name suggests, the biggest feature of \"Note\" is convenience. You only need to tap the \"Note Save Button\" to complete the recording of the current web page without any other operations.\nAnd, when you want to remove the \"Note\", you only need to click the button again to complete it.\nAfter the web page is saved as a note, the two are automatically associated.\nYou can quickly switch to the \"Note\" you want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and you will be able to do more temporary tasks.\nWhen you no longer need the \"Note\", you can delete it, and its associated webpage will be automatically closed.\n\n\n===============\n4.      Active Tab\n===============\n\nThis shows all the currently opened webpages. We can quickly switch to the tab that we want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and we won't be in a hurry because of opening too many webpages.\nAnd the most recently visited webpage will be automatically displayed at the top of the list, you don’t even need to search, you can switch back and forth between multiple webpages by shortcut keys.\nIn addition, this extension also specially optimizes the headlines of the web pages. What you see in the list will be refreshing headlines, which will be restored to the original headlines only when you select or search.\n\n\n===============\n5.      Bookmark\n===============\n\nThere is a difference between \"Bookmark\" and \"Note\". \"Note\" is only temporary. \"Bookmark\" have a longer validity period and will be opened frequently.\nUnfortunately, Chrome’s built-in bookmark search is more troublesome. You need to search in a separate bookmark management page, which is very inefficient.\nSo this extension also adds a bookmark function.\nRelying on the powerful search function, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys of the extension itself, here \"Bookmark\" will also bring you a new experience.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n6.        History\n===============\n\nAlthough Chrome's built-in history function is good, it is still a bit inconvenient to open a new tab.\nSo this plugin has also been extended.\nSimilarly, relying on the powerful search function of the extension itself, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys, here \"History\" will also bring you a new experience.\nIn addition, this extension also groups the records of the same domain name, which will make it easier to read.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n7.      Search All\n===============\n\nThis is a separate \"Workspace\", although we can find \"Window\", \"Bookmarks\", \"History\", etc. through \"Workspace Switching\", but in \"Search All\", there is no need to perform \"Workspace Switching\".\nYou can query all content, greatly improving search efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also add a \"Search Engine\", when you can't find the content, you can select the appropriate \"Search Engine\" to search.\nYou can also perform operations such as \"top\", \"bottom\", and \"smart sorting\" on the \"work area\" in the \"Settings Center\" to personalize the search results.\n\n\n====================\n8.  Workspace Switching\n====================\n\nWith so many functions mentioned above, it is obviously impossible to display all the windows in one extension, so there is \"Workspace Switching\".\nThe Workspace here refers to the previous functions, and a function is a Workspace.\nYou can switch between Workspaces very flexibly through left and right selection on the keyboard, setting of shortcut keys in the Workspace, input \">\" in the search box, drop-down menus, indicators, etc.\nAnd the extension will record the current Workspace, and the Workspace shown last time will be displayed when it is started next time.\nYou can also \"pin\" a certain Workspace so that no matter what the current Workspace is, this Workspace will be opened next time you start it.\nYou may not use some functions, you can also disable them, so that this Workspace will no longer be displayed.\nAfter switching the Workspace, the corresponding Workspace will also automatically search according to the content of the input box without re-entering.\n\n\n===============\n 9.       Theme\n===============\n\nYou can set the height, font size, color, etc. of the list in \"Settings Center\". The extension itself provides up to 99 settings.\nBy saving the settings as \"Theme\", you can change the behavior and style of the extension very flexibly.\nThings like \"Sidebar\", \"Frosted Effect\", \"Highly Automated\" and so on are all.\nIn addition, there are \"Popup\" and \"Injection\" modes, \"Dark Mode\", \"Start Speed Modification\" and other functions.\n\n\n===============\n10       Keymap\n===============\n\nIn \"Settings Center - Help - Keymap\", you can get all the shortcut keys provided by this extension.\nThere are only a few commonly used shortcut keys, but there are different operations in different Workspaces, so hundreds of expanded functions can be easily controlled by shortcut keys, which greatly improves production efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also customize shortcut keys for some functions. Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12. Settings Center\n================\n\nAs you can see, this extension provides a lot of functions, but it does not necessarily meet everyone's needs.\nTherefore, \"Settings Center\" provides a lot of personalized settings, you can customize your needs here.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above is the detailed introduction of this extension, more features need you to discover.\nIf you think this extension is very good, or want to provide some suggestions, please leave a message in the comment area.\n╰(￣▽￣)╭",

The extension itself provides up to 99 settings.\nBy saving the settings as \"Theme\", you can change the behavior and style of the extension very flexibly.\nThings like \"Sidebar\", \"Frosted Effect\", \"Highly Automated\" and so on are all.\nIn addition, there are \"Popup\" and \"Injection\" modes, \"Dark Mode\", \"Start Speed Modification\" and other functions.\n\n\n===============\n10       Keymap\n===============\n\nIn \"Settings Center - Help - Keymap\", you can get all the shortcut keys provided by this extension.\nThere are only a few commonly used shortcut keys, but there are different operations in different Workspaces, so hundreds of expanded functions can be easily controlled by shortcut keys, which greatly improves production efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also customize shortcut keys for some functions. Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12. Settings Center\n================\n\nAs you can see, this extension provides a lot of functions, but it does not necessarily meet everyone's needs.\nTherefore, \"Settings Center\" provides a lot of personalized settings, you can customize your needs here.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above is the detailed introduction of this extension, more features need you to discover.\nIf you think this extension is very good, or want to provide some suggestions, please leave a message in the comment area.\n╰(￣▽￣)╭",

History\n===============\n\nAlthough Chrome's built-in history function is good, it is still a bit inconvenient to open a new tab.\nSo this plugin has also been extended.\nSimilarly, relying on the powerful search function of the extension itself, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys, here \"History\" will also bring you a new experience.\nIn addition, this extension also groups the records of the same domain name, which will make it easier to read.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n7.      Search All\n===============\n\nThis is a separate \"Workspace\", although we can find \"Window\", \"Bookmarks\", \"History\", etc. through \"Workspace Switching\", but in \"Search All\", there is no need to perform \"Workspace Switching\".\nYou can query all content, greatly improving search efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also add a \"Search Engine\", when you can't find the content, you can select the appropriate \"Search Engine\" to search.\nYou can also perform operations such as \"top\", \"bottom\", and \"smart sorting\" on the \"work area\" in the \"Settings Center\" to personalize the search results.\n\n\n====================\n8.  Workspace Switching\n====================\n\nWith so many functions mentioned above, it is obviously impossible to display all the windows in one extension, so there is \"Workspace Switching\".\nThe Workspace here refers to the previous functions, and a function is a Workspace.\nYou can switch between Workspaces very flexibly through left and right selection on the keyboard, setting of shortcut keys in the Workspace, input \">\" in the search box, drop-down menus, indicators, etc.\nAnd the extension will record the current Workspace, and the Workspace shown last time will be displayed when it is started next time.\nYou can also \"pin\" a certain Workspace so that no matter what the current Workspace is, this Workspace will be opened next time you start it.\nYou may not use some functions, you can also disable them, so that this Workspace will no longer be displayed.\nAfter switching the Workspace, the corresponding Workspace will also automatically search according to the content of the input box without re-entering.\n\n\n===============\n 9.       Theme\n===============\n\nYou can set the height, font size, color, etc. of the list in \"Settings Center\". The extension itself provides up to 99 settings.\nBy saving the settings as \"Theme\", you can change the behavior and style of the extension very flexibly.\nThings like \"Sidebar\", \"Frosted Effect\", \"Highly Automated\" and so on are all.\nIn addition, there are \"Popup\" and \"Injection\" modes, \"Dark Mode\", \"Start Speed Modification\" and other functions.\n\n\n===============\n10       Keymap\n===============\n\nIn \"Settings Center - Help - Keymap\", you can get all the shortcut keys provided by this extension.\nThere are only a few commonly used shortcut keys, but there are different operations in different Workspaces, so hundreds of expanded functions can be easily controlled by shortcut keys, which greatly improves production efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also customize shortcut keys for some functions. Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12. Settings Center\n================\n\nAs you can see, this extension provides a lot of functions, but it does not necessarily meet everyone's needs.\nTherefore, \"Settings Center\" provides a lot of personalized settings, you can customize your needs here.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above is the detailed introduction of this extension, more features need you to discover.\nIf you think this extension is very good, or want to provide some suggestions, please leave a message in the comment area.\n╰(￣▽￣)╭",

    "zh_CN": "1. 支持一键保存和打开所有网页，提高工作和学习效率\n2. 支持书签、历史和标签页等的聚合搜索，避免多处查找\n3. 可以根据自己的喜好调整插件的行为和样式，喜欢 DIY 的朋友可以尽情发挥\n\n\n------------------------------- 以下是详细介绍 -----------------------------------\n\n===============\n1.          窗口\n===============\n\n网页窗口太多占用资源？找起来麻烦但又不敢关掉，怕找不回来？\n利用这个功能，你可以保存当前窗口中的所有标签，并为其命名。\n下次你就可以通过搜索找到并打开窗口，从而恢复原来的网页，再也不用担心页面太多而占用资源了。\n另外，当窗口发生变化时，你还可以对其进行“重置”、“更新”、“绑定”等操作，从而保持窗口的整洁。\n\n\n===============\n2.      临时窗口\n===============\n\n有些网页你可能只是暂时用到，并不会频繁打开，但当前又想腾出空间来操作其它窗口。\n前面的【窗口】功能并不适合用在这里，于是就有了【临时窗口】这个功能。\n它同样可以将当前窗口内的所有网页地址保存起来，同时将自动关闭当前窗口，并且不需要为其命名，从而快速地保存和关闭窗口。\n等到你想重新浏览这些网页时，只需点击对应的【临时窗口】就可以立刻还原之前的网页，同时这条记录也将自动从列表中移除。\n有了这个功能，你不用再像以前那样打开一堆网页了。需要查看什么网页就开什么网页，暂时不需要的就把它收到【临时窗口】中，再也不用担心页面太多而占用资源了。\n另外，本扩展还提供了“保存左侧标签页”、“仅保存当前标签页”、“保存选中标签页”等选项，正真做到随心所欲。\n\n\n===============\n3.          便签\n===============\n\n前面说的两大功能针对的主要都是窗口，如果我们想要记录的仅仅只是一个标签（网页），那操作起来其实并不友好。\n别急，本人独创的【便签】功能将给你带来全新的网页浏览体验。\n顾名思义，【便签】最大的特点就是方便，你只需轻点一下“便签保存按钮”，就可以完成当前网页的记录，再不需要其它任何操作。并且，当前你想要移除【便签】时，也只需再次点击一下按钮就完成了。\n网页保存为便签后，两者就被自动关联起来。\n你可以通过本扩展自带的搜索功能快速切换到你想要浏览的【便签】，再多的临时任务你也将游刃有余。\n等你不再需要该【便签】时，就可以将其删除，其关联的网页也将被自动关闭。\n\n\n===============\n4.      活跃标签\n===============\n\n这个显示的全是当前已经打开的网页，我们可以通过本扩展自带的搜索功能快速切换到想要浏览的标签，再也不会因为打开太多网页而手忙脚乱了。\n并且最近访问的网页将自动显示在列表的最前面，你甚至都不需要搜索，就可以通过快捷键在多个网页间来回切换。\n另外，本扩展还特意对网页的大标题进行了优化， 你在列表中看到的将是一个个清爽的标题，只有在选中或者搜索时才会还原为原来的标题，一切都是多么地令人愉悦！\n\n\n===============\n5.          书签\n===============\n\n【书签】和【便签】是有区别的，【便签】只是暂时性的，【书签】的存在时效要更长，并且会经常被打开。\n可惜 Chrome 自带的书签搜索比较麻烦，需要在单独打开的书签管理页面中搜索，这操作效率非常低下。\n于是本扩展也添加了书签功能。\n依托扩展本身强大的搜索功能和友好的界面展示以及灵活的快捷键，在这里【书签】也将带给你新的体验。\n\n该功能默认是禁用状态，你可以在【设置中心】开启。\n\n\n===============\n6.      历史记录\n===============\n\nChrome 自带的历史记录功能虽然不错，但是要新开一个标签，操作起来还是有些不便的。\n所以本插件也对其进行了扩展。\n同样，依托扩展本身强大的搜索功能和友好的界面展示以及灵活的快捷键，在这里【历史记录】也将带给你新的体验。\n并且，本扩展还对相同域名的记录进行了分组，阅读起来将更加顺畅。\n\n该功能默认是禁用状态，你可以在【设置中心】开启。\n\n\n===============\n7.      全部搜索\n===============\n\n这是一个单独的“工作区”，虽然我们可以通过【工作区切换】来查找【窗口】、【书签】、【历史记录】等，但在【全部搜索】中，无需进行【工作区切换】就可以查询所有内容，大大提高了搜索效率。\n另外，你还可以添加“搜索引擎”，当查找不到内容时，可以选择合适的“搜索引擎”进行搜索。\n你还可以在【设置中心】对“工作区”进行“置顶”、“置底”、“智能排序”等操作，个性化定制搜索结果。\n\n\n===============\n8.     工作区切换\n===============\n\n前面说的那么多功能，扩展就一个窗口显然是无法全部展示的，于是就有了【工作区切换】。\n这里工作区指的就是前面的各个功能，一个功能就是一个工作区。\n通过键盘左右选择、设置工作区快捷键、搜索框输入“>”、下拉菜单、指示器 等，可以非常灵活地切换工作区。\n并且扩展会记录当前的工作区，下次启动时将显示上一次展示的工作区。\n你还可以将某一个工作区“钉”住，这样，无论当前工作区是什么，下次启动都将打开这个工作区。\n可能有些功能你用不到，你也可以将其禁用，这样就不会再显示这个工作区了。\n在切换工作区后，对应工作区也将自动根据输入框的内容进行联动搜索，不用重新输入。\n\n\n===============\n 9.    个性化主题\n===============\n\n你可以在【设置中心】设置列表的高度、字体大小、颜色等，扩展本身提供了多达 99 个设置，通过保存设置为【主题】，可以非常灵活地改变扩展的行为和样式，像“侧边栏”、“磨砂效果”、“高度自动化”等等都不在话下。\n另外还有“弹出”和“注入”模式、“暗黑模式”、“启动速度修改”等功能，你的扩展你做主。\n\n\n===============\n10        快捷键\n===============\n\n在【设置中心-帮助-快捷键】中，你可以获取本扩展所提供的所有快捷键。\n常用的快捷键只有几个，但在不同的工作区内却有不同的操作，因此通过快捷键可以轻易控制扩展的上百个功能，大大提高了生产效率。\n并且，你还可以对一些功能自定义快捷键，一旦设置成功，扩展将在显眼的位置显示快捷键，所以你并不需要刻意去记住快捷键，一切都是非常的简单。\n\n\n===============\n11.     导入导出\n===============\n\n目前【窗口】、【便签】和【临时窗口】以及【主题】的数据都是直接存储在本地的，原因是这些数据比较大，而 Chrome 提供的异步存储是非常有限的，还不稳定。\n你可以通过【导入导出】来对数据进行备份或多设备同步。未来，如果有了足够的资金，会加上同步功能，届时就不用手动同步了，当然作为备份还是非常有用的。\n\n\n===============\n12.     设置中心\n===============\n\n如你所见，本扩展所提供的功能非常多，但并不一定符合每一个人的需求。\n因此，【设置中心】提供了很多个性化设置，你可以在此定制你的需求。\n一句话概括：你的扩展你做主。\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n以上就是本扩展的详细介绍，更多功能需要你去发现。\n如果你觉得本扩展非常不错，或者想提供一些建议，欢迎在评论区留言。\n╰(￣▽￣)╭",
    "zh_TW": "1. 一鍵保存並打開所有網頁。\n2. 支持搜索書籤、歷史、標籤。\n3. 您可以輕鬆調整擴展的行為和样式。\n\n\n-------------------------------------- Details ---------------------------------------\n\n===============\n1.       Window\n===============\n\nToo many web pages take up resources? It's troublesome but you dare not turn it off, afraid that you won't be able to find it back?\nWith this function, you can save all tabs in the current window and name them.\nNext time, you can find and open the window through search to restore the original web page, and no longer have to worry about too many pages and take up resources.\nIn addition, when the window changes, you can also use \"Reset\", \"Update\", \"Bind\" and other operations to keep the window tidy.\n\n\n===================\n2.   Temporary Window\n===================\n\nYou may only use some web pages temporarily and do not open them frequently, but you currently want to make room for operating other windows.\nThe previous \"Window\" function is not suitable for use here, so there is a \"Temporary Window\" function.\nIt can also save all the web page addresses in the current window, and at the same time, it will automatically close the current window without naming it, thus quickly saving and closing the window.\nWhen you want to browse these webpages again, just click the corresponding \"Temporary Window\" to restore the previous webpage immediately, and this record will also be automatically removed from the list.\nWith this feature, you no longer need to open a bunch of web pages like before. Open whatever webpage you need to view, and receive it in the \"Temporary window\" if you don’t need it temporarily, no longer have to worry about too many pages and take up resources.\nIn addition, this extension also provides options such as \"Save the left tab\", \"Save only the current tab\", \"Save the selected tab\", etc., so you can do whatever you want.\n\n\n===============\n3.          Note\n===============\n\nThe two functions mentioned above are mainly aimed at windows. If we only want to record a tab (web page), it is actually not friendly to operate.\nDon't worry, my original \"Note\" function will bring you a brand new web browsing experience.\nAs the name suggests, the biggest feature of \"Note\" is convenience. You only need to tap the \"Note Save Button\" to complete the recording of the current web page without any other operations.\nAnd, when you want to remove the \"Note\", you only need to click the button again to complete it.\nAfter the web page is saved as a note, the two are automatically associated.\nYou can quickly switch to the \"Note\" you want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and you will be able to do more temporary tasks.\nWhen you no longer need the \"Note\", you can delete it, and its associated webpage will be automatically closed.\n\n\n===============\n4.      Active Tab\n===============\n\nThis shows all the currently opened webpages. We can quickly switch to the tab that we want to browse through the search function that comes with this extension, and we won't be in a hurry because of opening too many webpages.\nAnd the most recently visited webpage will be automatically displayed at the top of the list, you don’t even need to search, you can switch back and forth between multiple webpages by shortcut keys.\nIn addition, this extension also specially optimizes the headlines of the web pages. What you see in the list will be refreshing headlines, which will be restored to the original headlines only when you select or search.\n\n\n===============\n5.      Bookmark\n===============\n\nThere is a difference between \"Bookmark\" and \"Note\". \"Note\" is only temporary. \"Bookmark\" have a longer validity period and will be opened frequently.\nUnfortunately, Chrome’s built-in bookmark search is more troublesome. You need to search in a separate bookmark management page, which is very inefficient.\nSo this extension also adds a bookmark function.\nRelying on the powerful search function, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys of the extension itself, here \"Bookmark\" will also bring you a new experience.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n6.        History\n===============\n\nAlthough Chrome's built-in history function is good, it is still a bit inconvenient to open a new tab.\nSo this plugin has also been extended.\nSimilarly, relying on the powerful search function of the extension itself, friendly interface display and flexible shortcut keys, here \"History\" will also bring you a new experience.\nIn addition, this extension also groups the records of the same domain name, which will make it easier to read.\n\nThis function is disabled by default, and you can enable it in \"Settings Center\".\n\n\n===============\n7.      Search All\n===============\n\nThis is a separate \"Workspace\", although we can find \"Window\", \"Bookmarks\", \"History\", etc. through \"Workspace Switching\", but in \"Search All\", there is no need to perform \"Workspace Switching\".\nYou can query all content, greatly improving search efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also add a \"Search Engine\", when you can't find the content, you can select the appropriate \"Search Engine\" to search.\nYou can also perform operations such as \"top\", \"bottom\", and \"smart sorting\" on the \"work area\" in the \"Settings Center\" to personalize the search results.\n\n\n====================\n8.  Workspace Switching\n====================\n\nWith so many functions mentioned above, it is obviously impossible to display all the windows in one extension, so there is \"Workspace Switching\".\nThe Workspace here refers to the previous functions, and a function is a Workspace.\nYou can switch between Workspaces very flexibly through left and right selection on the keyboard, setting of shortcut keys in the Workspace, input \">\" in the search box, drop-down menus, indicators, etc.\nAnd the extension will record the current Workspace, and the Workspace shown last time will be displayed when it is started next time.\nYou can also \"pin\" a certain Workspace so that no matter what the current Workspace is, this Workspace will be opened next time you start it.\nYou may not use some functions, you can also disable them, so that this Workspace will no longer be displayed.\nAfter switching the Workspace, the corresponding Workspace will also automatically search according to the content of the input box without re-entering.\n\n\n===============\n 9.       Theme\n===============\n\nYou can set the height, font size, color, etc. of the list in \"Settings Center\". The extension itself provides up to 99 settings.\nBy saving the settings as \"Theme\", you can change the behavior and style of the extension very flexibly.\nThings like \"Sidebar\", \"Frosted Effect\", \"Highly Automated\" and so on are all.\nIn addition, there are \"Popup\" and \"Injection\" modes, \"Dark Mode\", \"Start Speed Modification\" and other functions.\n\n\n===============\n10       Keymap\n===============\n\nIn \"Settings Center - Help - Keymap\", you can get all the shortcut keys provided by this extension.\nThere are only a few commonly used shortcut keys, but there are different operations in different Workspaces, so hundreds of expanded functions can be easily controlled by shortcut keys, which greatly improves production efficiency.\nIn addition, you can also customize shortcut keys for some functions. Once the settings are successful, the extension will display the shortcut keys in a conspicuous position, so you don't need to deliberately remember the shortcut keys, everything is very simple.\n\n\n================\n11.  Import / Export\n================\n\nAt present, the data of \"Window\", \"Note\", \"Temporary Window\", and \"Theme\" are directly stored locally. The reason is that these data are relatively large, and the asynchronous storage provided by Chrome is very limited and unstable.\nYou can back up data or synchronize multiple devices through \"Import/Export\".\nIn the future, if I have enough funds, a synchronization function will be added, and you will not need to manually synchronize. Of course, it is still very useful as a backup.\n\n\n================\n12. Settings Center\n================\n\nAs you can see, this extension provides a lot of functions, but it does not necessarily meet everyone's needs.\nTherefore, \"Settings Center\" provides a lot of personalized settings, you can customize your needs here.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above is the detailed introduction of this extension, more features need you to discover.\nIf you think this extension is very good, or want to provide some suggestions, please leave a message in the comment area.\n╰(￣▽￣)╭"
