Powered by new Chrome engine features it uses special intellectual way to transform bright blinding stuff into eye relaxing, high contrast, deluminated, dark themed and just smart looking web-pages which are easy to read at night. Use this extension to take care of your eyes.\n\nNow with filter adjustment, font settings and ignore-list!\n\nUse the hotkeys Alt+Shift+D for switching the extension On/Off and Alt+Shift+A for adding current web-site into your sites list (you may choose if you would like to ignore these sites or invert them only). If the hotkeys don't work, set them up on this page chrome://extensions/configureCommands\n\nIf white splashes hurt your eyes, this is a Google issue. Join the conversation:\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/M_gtcHph_ZQ\n\nPLEASE, READ THE NEXT WARNINGS:\n1. Disable other similar extensions, they may interrupt DarkReader.\n2. White splashes between navigation and tab switching are Chromium issues 1373 and 126341.\n3. Chrome Web Store page will not be inverted due to security reasons.\n4. Dear Reader, if your favorite site doesn't look well with this extension (e.g. some images are inverted), please post us a link at darkreaderapp@gmail.com\n5. If some sites are already dark, please send their addresses at darkreaderapp@gmail.com\n6. Switch off the extension before you disable or uninstall it. Otherwise your opened pages will stay inverted until you refresh them.\n7. If some pages work laggy, try setting filter values to \"off\".\n8.
