Chrome‚Äôs default History stores the title and URL of the websites you visit, ignoring all of the page‚Äôs content.  If you can‚Äôt remember the page title or URL, you‚Äôre out of luck.  Retrospective History indexes the full text contents of the pages you read, creating a personal, private, and local search engine to make your browsing history truly useful.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nYou can simply browse the web as usual, and Retrospective History will work in the background to automatically index the text content of the pages you visit. A red/green indicator on the toolbar icon shows whether the page you're currently viewing has been indexed. Be sure to pin the extension's icon to your Chrome toolbar so you can easily view this status indicator.  \n\nIf you want to delete the page that you're currently viewing from the index or add its domain to your ignore list, you can easily do so from the extension's toolbar popup window.\n\nWhen you need to find something you've read before, select \"Search History\" from the toolbar popup to open the search page. Enter your query to find matching results from your browsing history. Unlike Chrome's basic History which only shows page titles and URLs, this extension lets you search the full-text content of the pages you've visited.\n\nPlease note that Retrospective History does not index certain single page applications and \"infinite scroll\" style pages. Most social media sites fall in this category. The toolbar icon will indicate whether or not these pages have been indexed.\n\nKey Features:\n\nüîç Powerful Full-Text Search\n-Lightning-fast search across the full text of your browsing history\n-Filter and sort results by the date you accessed each page\n-View the context of your search term within each result\n-Easily find pages you visited even when you can't remember their title or URL\nüîí Private\n-All indexed data is stored locally on your computer\n-No data is ever transmitted from your system\n-Your browsing history remains your own\nü¶æ Flexible Configuration\n-Define a retention period for your history to automatically delete old entries\n-Add domains to a personal ignore list to prevent indexing pages you would rather not save\n-Choose between a Light and Dark mode user interface\n‚ö° Optimized Performance\n-Lightweight background indexing that won't slow down your browsing\n-Efficient storage management with auto deletion options available to clear old entries\nüë§ User-Friendly Interface\n-Clean, intuitive search interface\n-Easily see if the page you're currently viewing has been indexed with a red/green indicator on the extension's toolbar icon\n-Easy-to-use settings panel\n\nPrivacy First:\n\nYour privacy is key. All indexed content stays on your computer - nothing is ever uploaded to the cloud or shared. You have complete control over what gets indexed and how long it's stored.\n\nPerfect For:\n\n-Researchers tracking sources\n-Students organizing study materials\n-Professionals managing technical documentation\n-Anyone who wants to easily find content they've previously read\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.retrospectivehistory.com/privacy\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.retrospectivehistory.com/terms"
