This approach mitigates the risk depending on a single identity attribute.  The complexity involved in hacking multi-dimensional identity is about practicality and less about specific technologies.  Taken together, multiple attributes are prohibitively difficult for hackers and cannot be scaled for mass attacks. iVALT sees its approach as the foundation for building Zero Trustimplementation"
