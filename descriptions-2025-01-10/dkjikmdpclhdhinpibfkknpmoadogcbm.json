Unfortunately many websites don't so users are left to using browser Windows and OS level windowing management to re-produce this capability.\n\nPIPvideo does exactly what you imagine it does. It finds the video elements on the page and adds a little icon in the top left hand corner that when clicked it will open the video leveraging this API and the PIP technology built into Chromium.\n\nIn order to ensure that the extension doesn't have any negative performance implications you have to click the extension button for it to add the icon to the videos. I've successfully tested it on:\n\n* YouTube\n* NFL Gamepass\n* Disney Plus\n* Netflix\n* CNN\n* ESPN\n* Twitch\n* Mixer\n\nNotice: Some websites modify the DOM numerous times and because of this some sites do not currently work in the current design. Here are some that I have found that do not:\n\n* Polygon\n* Hulu\n* NBA.com\n* Hotstar"
