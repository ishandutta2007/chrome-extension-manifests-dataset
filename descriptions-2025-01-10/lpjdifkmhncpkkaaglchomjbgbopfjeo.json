There are multiple applications out there that cleans the browser cache, but CleanUp is the first one that clears the cache along with refreshing the page, and as a software developer myself, I understand how important it is to have both the steps of cache CleanUp and refresh to happen at the same time. CleanUp can be used as an alternative to just simply refreshing the page, as it clears the browser cache, which is a big plus. Here is a basic understanding about cache:\n\nEvery website that the users visit saves their information like passwords, email, username, search terms etc. in the form of cache, which is stored in the browser. Different websites use this knowledge to know more about its users, and the knowledge gained by cache is also the result of why the ads we see are so related to our search results. Hence, it is important to clean the cache on a regular basis to prevent any kind of malfunction that can be caused with this information.\n\nThe application is for all type of audience, both users and developers. Users will simply be able to delete the browser cache which will prevent other websites from using their data that has been saved by the browser, aka \"cache\". For developers, people who mainly work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS or use any kind of web designing techniques understand how important it is to clear browser cache when any changes are made in the code. I use Flask for web development myself, and I find CleanUp extremely useful when I make any changes to my HTML or JavaScript file.\n\nHope everyone out there enjoys some CleanUp!\n\nPlease direct all the inquires/bugs/questions to: himeshbuch257@gmail.com\nIcon credits: iconarchive.com"
