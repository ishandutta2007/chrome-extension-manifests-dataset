If the extension find a class whose break is not enough to walk to the next class, that is (break time - walking time) <= 2min, the extension will insert a red button below the location box in the Class Planner to tip you.\n\nThe red button will be [\"Ori\"+ weekday] (not enough time to get next class + the class on which weekday) or [\"Dest\"+ weekday] (not enough time to go from previous class + the class on which weekday).\n\nHover over the red button will display more information about next/previous class and time/distance.\n\nClick the icon of the extension will pop up a window for adjusting the remaining time you want to reserve (0-10 min, 2 min is default). The reset button will reset the remaining time to default. Select Tip Button used to select which type tip button appears in the Class Planner. \n\nSummary table shows BreakTime, WalkTime, ResTime and Distance of every class pairs, and hurry class pair is shown in red. The triangle next to [Summary] can collapse the summary table.\n\nAbout the extension:\nIn a quarter, I had a discussion session in Boelter Hall, and next discussion session in Public Affairs Building, it took me a long time to walk, and it is inconveninent to ask TA questions after discussion. Then, the idea of the extension was inspired by the discussion with Jonathan of this situation.\n\nThis extension is open-source on https://github.com/qingpeng9802/Easy-Class-Break-UCLA\n\nAcknowledgment:\nThe Chromium Authors' Mappy chrome extension\nInspired by Robert Ursua and Preetham Narayanareddy's Easy BruinWalk Ratings (UCLA) extension\nStack Overflow's answer contributor\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis extension uses Google Analytics to collect usage statistics to help improve user experience.
