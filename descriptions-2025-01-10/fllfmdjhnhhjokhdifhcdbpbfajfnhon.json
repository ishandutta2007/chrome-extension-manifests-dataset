Comes with a whitelist system, which allows users to specify specific subreddits the user doesn't want to block, and a blacklist system, which allows users to specify subreddits to block completely (comment threads included).\n\nPurpose: Reddit has become ubiquitous in many of our lives. Which is why it's incredibly difficult to block the entire website with a generic website blocker. As reddit can be used for both productive and unproductive means, this app aims to eliminate the unproductive time sink elements of reddit (the infinite content cycle of feeds), and keep the productive elements (e.g. finding answers through a link given by google search, or a whitelisted subreddit).\n\nThis app aims to lower or eliminate time wasted by reddit in a smarter way than attempting to block it outright.\n\nI am looking to always improve the app, so any feedback is welcome."
