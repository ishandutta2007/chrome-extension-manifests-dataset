With the increasing complexity of online data collection, this tool provides real-time analysis and informative insights to keep users aware of potential privacy risks without interfering with site functionality.\n\nKey Features:\nReal-Time Privacy Score: Each website is evaluated instantly, and users are presented with a simple color-coded privacy score (green, yellow, or red) to indicate the level of data collection and sharing.\nDetailed Risk Insights: Clicking the privacy score provides a breakdown of potential data collection practices (such as geolocation tracking or browsing history) and data sharing with third-party services.\nScript Scanning: The extension analyzes scripts running on websites for common patterns that may indicate potential risks, such as the use of tracking cookies or behavioral data collection.\nDesigned for Transparency, Not Protection\nData Share Guard does not block, prevent, or interfere with data collection or sharing on websites. It is important to note that this extension is designed solely to inform users about potential risks related to data privacy. While the extension provides information about possible data collection and sharing practices, it does not actively stop these actions from occurring. Users should not rely on Data Share Guard to protect or block any data collection processes.\n\nInstead, Data Share Guard aims to raise awareness by analyzing websites for known data collection practices and presenting this information in a clear and easy-to-understand format. Users can then make informed decisions about how they wish to interact with the websites they visit.\n\nWhy Use Data Share Guard?\nTransparency: Gain insights into what data websites may be collecting, so you can stay informed about your online privacy.\nSimplicity: The extension is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, giving you all the information you need without complicating your browsing experience.\nEducational: Learn more about online privacy practices through the detailed breakdown of each site's potential data collection and sharing activities.\nNo Guarantee of Full Detection\nDue to the evolving and sometimes hidden nature of modern tracking technologies, Data Share Guard does not guarantee the detection of all forms of data collection or sharing, especially on major platforms using advanced or server-side methods. We continue to update and enhance our detection capabilities, but certain sophisticated practices may not be fully captured.\n\nDisclaimer:\nData Share Guard is intended as an informational tool only. While it aims to provide users with insights into potential data practices, it is not a substitute for dedicated privacy protection tools. It does not block or prevent websites from collecting or sharing data. Users should be aware that the privacy score and risks indicated by Data Share Guard are based on patterns and keywords detected by the extension and may not reflect the full extent of a site's data practices. Always use your discretion when browsing online and consult privacy policies directly for complete information."
