Consider\nbringing this to the attention of the MJ team by posting about it in their\nDiscord ðŸš¨\n\nI got a bit tired of Midjourney's limited and buggy archive download solution so I decided to put together a quick and dirty chrome extension with GPT-4.\n\nFeatures:\n- Select a date range which you want to download images from\n- Only downloads upscaled images (no more cleaning up grids)\n- Option to download all v5+ and niji 5+ grid images separated\n- Each download contains a `archived_jobs.json` file that contains all metadata about the jobs including prompts (can also be downloaded separately)\n- Batch download support for older devices\n\nMake sure you're logged into Midjourney, otherwise this won't work."
