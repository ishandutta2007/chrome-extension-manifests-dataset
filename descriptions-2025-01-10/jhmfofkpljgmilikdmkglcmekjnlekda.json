This extension offers enterprise-level security, ideal for teams looking to engage in on-chain activities such as liquidity provisioning, lending/borrowing, on-chain futures, and more. \n\nSquads is trusted by the biggest companies on Solana and helps secure over $600 million in value. SquadsX is built on the Squads v4 program, which has been audited three times by Trail of Bits, OtterSec, and Neodyme. \n\nSquadsX is still in beta and bugs or compatibility issues may occur, for that reason SquadsX is only available to Squads Pro subscribers upon release. We've collaborated with leading projects in the ecosystem to ensure compatibility."
