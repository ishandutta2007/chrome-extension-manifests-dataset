ADD BETTER GOOGLE TASKS ALSO TO GET IT WORKING CORRECTLY -> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-google-tasks/denjcdefjebbmlihdoojnebochnkgcin\n\nHighlighting tasks and labels, based on keywords and patterns\nUse text to highlight tasks as you type in Google Tasks™! Works with the Google Tasks version at https://mail.google.com/tasks/ig. \n\nYou can use the following patterns for highlighting:\n• (x) — red highlight background and the (x) becomes an icon\n• /!\\ — yellow highlight background and the /!\\ becomes an icon\n• ★ or (*) — intense blue highlight background\n• ☆ or (o) — light blue highlight background\n• → or -> — intense blue highlight background\n• ⇨ or => — light blue highlight background\n• (~) — fades the whole task and (~) becomes an icon\n\nLabels are (for now) just a special character followed by any words optionally separated by dashes. However, any patterns may be supported in the future, such as the comment highlight and number highlight below. You can use the following patterns for labels:\n• +alphanumdash — \"+\" followed by any words and dashes\n• #alphanumdash — \"#\" followed by any words and dashes\n• @alphanumdash — \"@\" followed by any words and dashes\n• {*anychar*} — any character sequence between \"{*\" and \"*}\"\n• {digits} — any number of digits between \"{\" and \"}\"\n• {words} — highlight words \"{\" and \"}\"\n\nSupport for customizing patterns and colors is planned for a future version."
