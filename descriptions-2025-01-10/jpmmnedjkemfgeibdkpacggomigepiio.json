The app scans job postings, analyzes the requirements, and evaluates resumes to provide a percentage match score. It then highlights areas for improvement, such as skills to include, adjustments to the layout, and other enhancements to make resumes stand out. Users can access a personal dashboard to refine their resumes and cover letters, with a freemium model that lets them try features a few times before opting for advanced options. The goal is to make preparing job applications feel as easy and relaxing as a Sunday morning."
