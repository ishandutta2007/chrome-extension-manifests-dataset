One example is telling employees \"Try to be less white\". Companies exist to deliver services to their customers and not to preach woke politics.\n\nAnti-woke is also available as an Android app:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.freedom.anti_woke\n\nThe project is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/anti-wokeness/Anti-woke\n\nAlso available as a website:\nAnti-woke.net"
