Some sites handle images in ways that may be incompatible with this extension. In such cases, use the \"Open image in new tab\" feature to perform the transformations.\nTo save the transformed image, take a screenshot, as this extension does not provide image saving functionality.\nIn the past, great efforts were made to make the web compatible with mobile devices, in addition to home computers. However, even today, some websites are designed to look good only on mobile screens, neglecting the experience on larger screens. For instance, portrait mode videos on a laptop or large screen appear poorly designed.\nAlthough there's no quick solution for poor design choices, this extension aims to address the issue of needing to view an image rotated for a different perspective. It's particularly helpful when you come across a post on a website or social media site asking you to rotate your device to solve a puzzle. We hope you find it useful too.\nSupport Our Work\nThis extension is completely free and ad-free. If you enjoy using it, please consider supporting our work with a small tip. Your support helps us continue developing and maintaining this extension."
