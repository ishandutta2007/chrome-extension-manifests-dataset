You get to close these tabs runtime, even the Cognito ones.\n\n- Allurt automatically puts you're chrome into Do Not Disturb mode when you start sharing screens on google meet. It prevents apps like whats app or slack from sending you beeping notifications while you present your desktop to the world. Reverts back to the default state when the screen sharing stops.\n\nAllurt can save you several minutes before every screen sharing session. Instead of hastily going through different chrome tabs and windows, you now have a very clean interface that lets you do that in seconds. And it only takes a few milliseconds to prepare the list of all the tabs for you because the extension does that in the background when you're working on other things."
