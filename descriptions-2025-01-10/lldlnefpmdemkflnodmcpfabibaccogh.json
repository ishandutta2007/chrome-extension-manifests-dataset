For example:\n\nIf you add \"developer.chrome.com\" and \"developer.mozilla.org\" to the extension's list, when you search \"manifest\" in the extension's search bar, you will get results only from those sites, meaning your results will be about the browser extension file that must be named \"manifest.json\" (which is likely what you want), and not about the definition of \"manifest\" nor about any movie, song or literary work named \"manifest\".\n\nThe example above shows how the extension might allow you to write less. How so? Because when you're searching a technical term that looks like a normal word (like \"manifest\"), you have to provide extra context for the search engine to understand what you're looking for (writing \"extension manifest json\" instead of just \"manifest\", for example), but the extension allows you to narrow down that context to a closed site list beforehand.\n\nI think the extension might be useful for people who have a favorite set of sites to look for documentation, tutorials, articles or general information, and don't want to see results from anywhere else, nor want to be so specific every time they need to dissipate the engine's confusion with some queries (confusion that often doesn't happen when it knows where to look).\n\nBy the way, if the site you're currently seeing is already in your list, the action icon will become green. \n\nAlso, every listed site gets a checkbox (that is ticked by default) that you can untick to exclude that site from your next search without having to remove it from the list, and the extension will remember which checkboxes were left ticked and which were left unticked when you re-activate the action's popup.\n\nI've tested the extension with Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and Yahoo, and the results enforced by the extension are consistently very similar. \n\nSECONDARY FEATURES:\n\nIf you go in your browser to Manage extensions > Keyboard shortcuts, you can set a key shortcut for a command called \"Go to a search bar in the current page\".\n\nThat command tries to focus a search bar on the page you're currently seeing, if there's any. It doesn't work in all pages because of the huge variety in which search bars have been implemented, but it will work in many. It also won't work in pages that don't start with either \"http\" or \"https\", for example: It won't be able to focus the search bar of your browser's settings page.\n\nI thought of that command as a fitting complement because, like the main feature, it helps to search a bit faster, and because for some reason, most pages (even documentation pages) don't have a key shortcut to their search bar."
