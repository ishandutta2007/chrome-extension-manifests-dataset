This compels us to manually input the password, which can be even more laborious when dealing with lengthy passwords from a password manager. Moreover, certain websites necessitate entering the password twice during sign-up, demanding a repetitive manual entry. This is where this extension becomes useful.\n\nHow to use\n\n- Choose the website's input field.\n- Launch the extension.\n- Input the password into the extension's designated field.\n- Click the \"Paste\" button.\n- And just like that, the password will be populated in the corresponding field on the website."
