The interface actions include capturing screen and user-entered data, and requesting access to related documents and functions in the UnForm archiving system. Data capture includes any data accessed through the browser's document object model and user data such as input text fields, radio and list selection options, and even file uploads. Responses from the UnForm server can include direct access to archived documents, indexed lists of documents, thumbnails, and more. Both data capture definitions and server responses are custom coded at the server, so are extremely flexible.\n\nIn addition to ERP integration, the extension also offers printing of PDF and other files through the UnForm server."
