Now you really know which is your scary hole...\n\nUse this by logging into the EGU handicap site (https://members.whsplatform.englandgolf.org/). Then launch the plugin. It will take a few seconds to analyse your rounds (up to twenty according to how many scores and how fast your computer and internet connection are!).\n\nCaveat: I built this mostly for my own entertainment, and it's only been tested on my results on my computer, so there are probably situations for which I haven't catered . If you try it, please let me know whether it worked!"
