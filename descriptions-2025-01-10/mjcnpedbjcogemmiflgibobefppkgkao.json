Clicking the star creates a cool animation and sound, and counts the number of stars your student has received. You can reset the stars at any time.\n\nIn addition to star awards, this extension also offers features for student data management. You can locally store your students' data, including information on what was covered in the last lesson, and track their progress over time. With these capabilities, you can easily monitor your students' growth and tailor your lessons to their needs.\n\nOverall, this extension is designed to make online teaching more engaging and rewarding for both you and your students. Whether you're teaching a small group or a large class, TeachersXchange's extension provides the tools you need to manage your students' progress and keep them motivated.\n\nCreated by www.TeachersXchange.com and www.ESLcourseware.com"
