By doing this, it helps reunite pets with their loving families. Findpet uses advanced biometric identification tools which are powered by Computer Vision technology to automate lost pet searches. Findpet uses full-body pet identification that includes your pet's unique features like their face, front, sides, top, back, fur, and color patterns.\n\nSocial media is where most lost and found pets are reported, but they often lack the proper tools to process information in an organized way. Information is presented in an unstructured way in a constellation of pages, groups, and news feeds with no tools to automate search or filter results. Social media shows what they think you want to see or what they have been paid by advertisers, not necessarily the information that helps reunite pets. Currently, pets are reunited thanks to passionate pet lovers like you who match lost and found pets across dozens or even hundreds of pages and groups. This can be an inefficient and grueling task. Let's bring all the lost and found pet reports to one place and use advanced technology to reunite pets in a more efficient way. Join the Findpet volunteer community today and help us on our mission to protect every pet and return every lost pet back home!\n\nTo repost lost or found pet reports to Findpet, follow these simple instructions:\n1.
