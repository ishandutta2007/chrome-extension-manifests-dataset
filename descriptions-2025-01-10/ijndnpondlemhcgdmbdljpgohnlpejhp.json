We use a probability calculator based on statistics which will help us know if one test has enough volume and distribution to have a higher probability of being the correct outcome. If you do not measure the level of significance, you may launch a split test winner to production and find out that the results were not good. \n\nTools like Visual Website Optimizer, Optimizely and other ab testing tools have their own built in ab test calculators, but we do not trust/recommend these. You need to be measuring your AB tests in your analytics tools and calculating statistical significance of of that data. This will give you the best test of significance. Once we have run our statistical significance test we can verify if we have a real winner or not.\n\nWith our tool you can calculate statistical significance right in your Chrome browser. You can use this for email ab testing, website ab testing, mobile app ab testing, ppc ab testing and just about any testing period.\n\nCalculating the significance of AB test results is always a hassle. Some analytics tools attempt to tell you when significance has been reached, and others simply pretend it doesn’t matter. Using the McGaw.io Statistical Significance and AB Test Calculator you’ll be able to quickly determine whether your test results are significant - all from a simple chrome extension. Stop opening new tabs and searching for statistical significance calculators that are hard to use and harder to understand.\n\nHave any questions or feedback? Let us know by emailing Dan@mcgaw.io."
