You always have what you need on-the-go, and you're not tied to a single browser. But for day-to-day use it's tedious to open the bookmark site and search for a URL, especially the most frequent ones over and over.\n\nI wrote this extension because I wanted a way to generate bookmarks in Chrome using Pinboard's \"tags\". You specify the tags (or combinations of tags) for which you want to generate bookmarks, and they'll be added to the Bookmarks Bar.\n\nHow to Use It\n\nWhen you open the extension for the first time you'll need to supply your Pinboard API Token, which is how third-party apps securely communicate with the Pinboard service on your behalf.\n\nAfter your API Token is verified, you can select the tags for which you want to generate bookmarks. Selected tags will be visible in a treeview, where you can change and reorder them. The treeview has a context menu for creating folders and performing other actions, and there's a settings panel with other available options.\n\nOnce you've got the tags arranged in the treeview the way you'd like, click the \"Generate Bookmarks\" button. It'll lookup bookmarks matching your selected tags and add them to your Bookmarks Bar.\n\nRequested Permissions\n\nThis extension requests the following permissions:\n\nBookmarks - Needed to add to (and remove from) the Bookmarks Bar\nStorage - Needed to store the API Token, selected tags and other settings locally between sessions\nhttps://api.pinboard.in - Needed in order to access the Pinboard API, including your tags and bookmarks\n\nNeed Help?\n\nIf you have questions or a problem with using the extension, I'd prefer you create an issue on GitHub.\n\nInclude as many details as possible about what you were doing at the time, what errors you got (if any), and what you expected to happen as well as what actually did happen.\n\nWhat This is Not\n\nThis is not a two-way 'sync'. Bookmarks that you create from within Chrome will not be pushed to Pinboard. It's only for retrieving bookmarks from Pinboard (via tags) into Chrome's \"Bookmarks Bar\".\n\nFixes\n\n1.0.1 - Bug fix. On some platforms the main bookmarks bar is identified as \"Bookmarks bar\" instead of \"Bookmarks Bar\". Needed to perform a case-insensitive search, instead of a case-sensitive one, when looking for the bookmarks bar."
