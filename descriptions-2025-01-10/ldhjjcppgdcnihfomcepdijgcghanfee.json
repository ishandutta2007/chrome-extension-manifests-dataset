He was given due process, had a chance to reject any jurors, agreed to the jurors, was given the choice to testify and declined, and expressly declined a \"right to counsel\" defense. It was a fair and just trial.\n\nThis chrome extension modifies the text in any web page to accurately reflect Donald's convicted felon status, for purposes of historical accuracy."
