The Hebrew text will be replaced to include nekudot.\n\nIt is not perfect, but it performs really well especially if you are looking to pronounce Sephardi, or Israeli, Hebrew where Kamatz and Pataá¸¥ sound the same.\n\nKnown issues:\n* \"I'm not seeing a Nekudot icon where the extensions are\"\nThis is likely because chrome has elected not to show it. You can change this by clicking on the puzzle-piece shaped icon on the top right and pinning the Nekudot icon to the toolbar.\n* This does not work on Google Docs. This would require making a Google Workspace addon (or require logins and require unreasonable permissions) in addition to this chrome extension and well, nope.\n\nPlease support further development and show your appreciation at paypal.me/GiladAmar.\nIf not, no worries, it's free and will always be. \n\nThis extension is open-source at github.com/GiladAmar/Nekudot. So if you're looking to learn how to build a Chrome extension, or use TensorFlow.js in one, please take a peak.\n\nThis wouldn't be possible without the work done by Elazar Gershuni and Yuval Pinter in arxiv.org/abs/2105.05209 who graciously let me use their LSTM model. Thank you, it's a really cool and original use of machine learning."
