However you will need both line and column numbers. This can be difficult with a simple window.onerror handler as that does not provide the column information. \n\nThere are various libraries that will wrap native functions with try/catches that could provide the column from error.stack. Use at your own risk (not sure how I feel about them)\n\nIn my case (enterprise) we have mostly IE8 users at the moment, during window.onerror it is possible to either A. Walk to callee and build a stack or B. Use window.error.errorcharacter to capture the column number. This is what I am going to be doing for the time being.\n\n\nTested with\nSource Map Version 3\nJavaScript source files\n\nSource: https://github.com/RyanSylvestre/sourceMapper\nLink to store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enenhalmnhnpofkecebdmgnmmhfkhcpb"
