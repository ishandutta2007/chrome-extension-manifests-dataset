We don't save anything. We don't even _have_ a server. (How do we do this magic?  This extensions creates a Google Sheet, owned by you and only readable by you, that saves your notes privately)\n\nOne not so great thing about VuAgain is that this code is very new. You may find bugs.  If you do, I apologize. Please report them, and I'll try to fix ASAP."
