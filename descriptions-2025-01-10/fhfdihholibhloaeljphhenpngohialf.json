While it might sound scary, it's because of permission to access cookies storage. The extension doesn't change anything besides cookies and never runs in the background.\n\n---\n\nThe \"Just Cookies\" browser extension is a simple, privacy-friendly way to view and edit cookies with just a few clicks. Here are some features that make it stand out:\n\n- View website cookies. View and edit website cookies with just a few clicks.\n- Add new cookies. Add new cookies to any website.\n- Filter cookies. Quickly find the cookie you are looking for.\n- No unnecessary permissions required. The extension requires site-wide access because otherwise Chrome doesn't give access to cookies.\n- No 3rd party trackers or ads. We value your privacy and ensure that the extension does not contain third-party trackers or ads that may compromise your data.\n- Memory-efficient. The extension only runs when you click the icon, so it won't slow down your device with unnecessary background processes.\n- Dark mode. Choose between the light and dark modes.\n\nWhat's the catch / why it's free?\n\nThis extension is created by HeroTofu.com, we have both free and paid products. Our paid products help pay for the cost of creating and maintaining the free ones, like the \"Just Cookies\" extension.\n\nThis means we can give you the extension for free, without any hidden costs."
