My solution is a convenient star rating system in the form of a browser extension that allows you to rate YouTube videos from 1 to 5 stars and see their ratings.\n\nThe difference between the rating systems is subtle, yet significant.\n*Star rating* - we associate it with quality. If you see a video rated with 5 stars, you will think it is excellent quality.\n*Like/dislike rating* - we associate it with preference. If you see a video that received some \"likes\", you will think some people prefer it, without necessarily associating it with quality.\n\nMore information about the extension is available on my website https://youtubestarrating.ozbot.si\n\nBut this is just the beginning.\n\nAs we grow as a community I'll continue to upgrade the extension and bring you more features and a better user experience.\n\nYou can support the project at https://buymeacoffee.com/youtubestarrating"
