Whether you're working in Overleaf or RStudio (Posit), seamlessly integrate references into your LaTeX, Quarto, or R Markdown documents without ever leaving your project!\n\nCiteDrive is built from the ground up to stay out of your way and help you focus on writing.\n\nONE-CLICK REFERENCE COLLECTION\n\nCollecting references for your paper has never been easier. With the CiteDrive Companion browser add-on, discover articles, books, or websites through your regular sources– Google Scholar, Pubmed, and many others– and simply click the CiteDrive icon on your toolbar to add the reference directly to your CiteDrive project.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE BIBTEX CODE\n\nUnlike many other reference managers, CiteDrive is Bib[La]TeX native and gives you complete control to customize your BibTeX reference snippets as you collect them. Better yet, your customizations carry through as you connect your CiteDrive and Overleaf (or other LaTeX editors) projects or RStudio (Quarto and R Markdown) so you can take full advantage of custom field extensions.\n\nSEAMLESS IN-TEXT CITATIONS\n\nInserting in-text citations to your Overleaf paper from your CiteDrive project is a snap with the browser add-on. Simply look for the new “Insert Citation” button at the top of the Overleaf screen, select the reference of interest, and the appropriate in-text citation will be generated and inserted for you."
