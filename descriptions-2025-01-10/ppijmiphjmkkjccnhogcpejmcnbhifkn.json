It's not really a ban, more like a blacklist or block, but it's the next best thing. Make SBNation a fun place to visit and block the trolls.\n\nInstructions: Install the extension. When you are on an SBNation blog the B! icon will turn red. This means the extension is active. Click on the red B! icon and add the *exact* username of anyone who you wish to block. Note this will also hide any replies to those users.\n\nUpdates: \nv1.2.0 - modified to work against \"old style\" SBNation comment sections\nv1.1.3 - modified to include sbnation blogs that do not have sbnation in their URL\n\nKnown issues: \n\nSometimes, after adding a name to be blocked, the comments will not be blocked until the page is reloaded.\n\nThis extension does not \"re-link\" the Z-keypress action. i.e. if 'Z' would have taken you to a comment that is now blocked, it will jump to the top of the page instead. Just keep pressing 'Z' and eventually you will get to a \"good\" comment.\n\nFIXED in v1.2.0: This extension works on \"normal\" SBNation blog comment pages. Fanposts use a different commenting system and this extension is not designed to work there."
