When you are done you can copy the complete list of words and paste it in your negative keyword list or where ever your heart desires. \n\nIt also counts how many times you have copied so if you are on another account you can remember to clear the list.\n\nHappy to hear your thoughts, what else you may use it for and your valuable feedback!"
