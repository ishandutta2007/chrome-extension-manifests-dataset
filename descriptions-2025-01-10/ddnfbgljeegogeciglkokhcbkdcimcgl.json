Enjoy that photo you took a year ago or more, and if it’s not a nice one, just type faster :D\n\n★WHY★\nWe are Shachaf, Johnny and Ido\nWe take lots of photos... lots of photos\nWe never look at those photos, never (maybe Johnny does because he tidies his photos every few months but he’s a freak)\nWe thought it would be fun to see the photos in the context of one year ago, two years ago, three years ago… you get the idea\n\n\nThis is self-funded and a side project to keep us stimulated. We aren’t part of an evil corporation that is trying to spy on you, so please let us know if you like it or what we can do better. And if you want to buy us a coffee, we will take it :)"
