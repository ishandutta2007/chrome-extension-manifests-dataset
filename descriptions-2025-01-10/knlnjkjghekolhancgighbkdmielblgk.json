The extension will work seamlessly, completely shielding a user from the bug without compromising the performance, functionality, or look-and-feel of the baskinrobbins.com website.\n\nBRBr is, and will always be free, with no in-app purchases for later functionality. \n\nThis is only under the \"Fun\" category because it's fun to have correct casing."
