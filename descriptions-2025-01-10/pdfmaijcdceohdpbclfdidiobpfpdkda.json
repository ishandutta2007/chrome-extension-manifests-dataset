It's not for everybody.\n\nDW is extremely small, the source code has only 5 kB. This is\nextremely important because now anybody can read the source\nand understand it. The best way how to use DW is to create\nyour own extension based on it, because when it comes to ad\nblocking, you should not trust anyone.
