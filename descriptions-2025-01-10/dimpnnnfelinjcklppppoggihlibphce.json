To activate it, simply install the extension here and open developer tools. You can do this by pressing f12. Developer tools need to be opened so the extension has permissions to read network activity, so it will only work if the developer tools are opened, but you can keep it at the smallest size possible. Whenever you want to check your footprint from the websites you visit, press the leaf icon at the top right and it will show you megabytes transferred, electricity used, co2 released, and polar ice melted from your use of the internet. Hopefully, this will make you more environmentally conscious. To learn more about the calculations involved, visit the website https://rapturt9.github.io/web_footprint."
