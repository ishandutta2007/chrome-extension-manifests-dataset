Velocity\n2. Defects\n3. Code complexity\n4. Test coverage\n5. Coding violations (Retrieved from code review tools, Sonar etc)\n6. LCOM Suspects (From Sonar)\n\nThe tool helps to do some of the following (in current version):\n\n1. Create one or more projects\n2. Add/Edit sprint details for each projects on regular basis\n3. Analyze the code quality delivered across one or more sprints\n4. Compare code quality delivered by different project teams\n5. Create saved reports for later use (share with senior management or presentation etc)"
