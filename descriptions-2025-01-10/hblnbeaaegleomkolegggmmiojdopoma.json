All Sides has compiled an index of the bias ratings of quite a few media houses from across the globe (www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings). However, the problem remains that most people are not aware that these ratings exist, and even if they are, opening up the AllSides website and finding these ratings is too much work.\nOur chrome extension tries to banish that problem. Simply pressing on the ‘Know Political Bias’ icon in the menu bar would display a popup that tells users about the political leanings (right, centre-right, centre, centre-left, left) of the website they’re currently on.\n\nThis extension was built by Swayam Sidh Tripathy and Jai Relan. In case you’re facing any problem, or you have some ideas on improving the extension, feel free to drop an email to them at tripathy.swayam@gmail.com or jairelan@whyq.net.in.\n\nAll the data for the chrome extension was sourced from All Sides. We obtained this data from an open-source repository of Github and then used the values from row #1 and #2 for the current extension. We plan on integrating the other data points down the line, but that’s all for another day. We hope you enjoy using this extension - feel free to leave a review!"
