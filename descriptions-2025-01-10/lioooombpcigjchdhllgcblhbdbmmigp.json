Tailored for elite Avocado testers but invaluable for all, this extension facilitates the effortless sharing of issue details. Testers can swiftly capture, copy, and share. With \"Quick Share\" for brief highlights and \"Advanced Share\" for in-depth details, it simplifies the distribution of information into Spectrum chats, improving communication and collaboration.\n\nNote: When an image link tag is selected and an image is found and scrapped, the link will be positioned at the beginning of shared content, enabling Spectrum to display a miniature image taken from the report rather than the standard Issue Council sign-in window embed taken from the IC link. After pasting into Spectrum, simply delete the image link, leaving the remaining content below the link unchanged. This streamlined process allows you to effectively illustrate your issues using images without retaining links to media as part of the chat messages.\n\nChangelog:\n\nRelease notes for 2.3 - April 10, 2024\nUI Overhaul for Extension Menu Popup:\n- The Extension Menu Popup interface has received bug fixes and tuning, enhancing aesthetics and user interaction for a more intuitive and pleasant experience.\n\nRelease notes for 2.2 - April 9, 2024\n\nImplementation of the Extension Menu Popup:\n- Deployed Advanced Search Capability within Extension Menu Popup: Integrated a comprehensive search module into the extension popup, allowing users to perform issue queries via textual input directly from the browser toolbar.\n- Project Selection Mechanism Enhancement in Popup Interface: Implemented a user-friendly project selection interface within the popup, featuring tag buttons for seamless toggling between \"Star Citizen\" and \"Launcher\" projects.\n- Refined Filtering Options in Popup: Introduced sophisticated dropdown filters for \"Status,\" \"Severity,\" and \"Report Date\" within the popup, enabling users to refine search results with greater precision.\n- Search Function Activation via Popup: Activated a \"Search\" button within the popup that launches filtered issue queries in a new browser tab, optimizing search workflow directly from the extension menu.\n- Issue Creation Workflow Optimization in Popup: Added a \"Create New Issue\" button within the popup, providing direct access to the issue creation page of the selected project in a new tab, streamlining the issue reporting process.\n- Dynamic Navigation Links in Popup: Rolled out adaptive navigation links for \"My Reports,\" \"My Contributions,\" and \"Followed Issues\" within the popup, which auto-adjust based on the project selection and open in new tabs for enhanced navigation.\n- Resource Accessibility Improvements via Popup: Embedded direct links within the popup to \"Patch Notes,\" \"ETF Announcements,\" \"ETF Chat,\" and \"Waka Tracker,\" offering instant access to essential resources and community discussions.\n- Interactive UI Elements in Popup: Implemented logic to enable the \"Search\" button within the popup dynamically, contingent upon query input presence, enhancing user interface interactivity and preventing empty searches.\n- Automated Link Update Mechanism in Popup: Ensured that navigation links within the popup are automatically updated upon project selection change, leveraging dynamic content updating for a seamless user experience directly from the browser extension.\n\nRelease notes for 2.1 - April 5, 2024\n\nData Scraping Improvements:\n- Enhanced URL Formatting Logic: Introduced an algorithm to extract and format URLs up to the ticket number, ensuring the relevance of links in the dataset and improving data cleanliness.\n- Dynamic Contribution ID Extraction: Developed functionality to dynamically scrape Contribution IDs from URLs, enhancing data richness for advanced analysis purposes.\n- Issue ID and Category Scraping: Integrated advanced selectors for scraping Issue IDs and Categories directly from the DOM, enriching the dataset for detailed reporting and analysis.\n- Link Styling Standardization: Unified the approach for hyperlink styling across different sections, maintaining consistency in the presentation of links within the dataset.\n\nRelease notes for 2.0 - April 4, 2024\n\nUsability Enhancements:\n- Clear All Selections Feature: Implemented functionality for immediate deselection of all user-selected options via a singular action, enhancing the interface's navigational efficiency.\n\nData Scraping Improvements:\n- Enhanced Data Extraction Methods: Enhanced scraping algorithms to include data parsing for \"What Happened\" and \"Reproduction Steps\" segments, ensuring comprehensive data capture.\n- Modal Data Extraction Expansion: Augmented data scraping scope to encompass advanced view modal information, capturing details like 'Followed By,' 'Community Severity,' 'Suspected Duplicates,' and 'Versions,' thereby enriching the dataset for comprehensive analysis.\n- Dynamic Expiration Date Resolution: Optimized the algorithm for Expiration Date extraction to dynamically compute and present dates based on the extracted dataset, improving data accuracy and relevance.\n\nInterface and Interaction Enhancements:\n- Overlay System Implementation: Deployed an updated overlay system that signifies processing states with \"Processing\" and \"Finished\" indicators for streamlined status communication.
