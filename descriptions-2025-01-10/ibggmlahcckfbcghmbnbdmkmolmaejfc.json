Then, you can Pet them individually or all at once from any webpage connected to the Matic Network.\n\nRequirements:\n- Metamask (Connected to Matic network)\n- Atleast one Aavegotchi assigned to your address\n\nIf your Aavegotchi's are not showing, either connect your current page to Metamask or go on to a webpage that already is connected to Metamask and refresh the page. Your Aavegotchi friends will then be able to follow you throughout your journeys on the web!\n\nIf you like this project, feel free to tip the creator at:\n0x7121CBdA61e025EB6639Cd797F63aad30F270680"
