This extension is an example of how you can connect to Aprimo APIs to extend the product in meaningful ways. This is an open source extension and source code can be found on Aprimo Connect's github page at https://github.com/aprimo-connect.\n\nThis extension is offered as-is and is meant to serve as an example of how you can consume Aprimo APIs and is not an officially supported Aprimo product. If it's valuable to you or there are feature requests, we'd love to hear about it on Aprimo Voice in the Integrations / Connectors section.\n\nIn order to set this up, your system administrator will need to provide you with a Client ID. \n\nSystem Administrators, please request an Administration guide from your Aprimo contact."
