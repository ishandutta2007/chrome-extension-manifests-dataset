More exciting features are on the way. \n\nTag Assistant helps you install and troubleshoot your Google tags, including Google Analytics, Google Ads, Tag Manager and more. When clicked, the extension displays the Google tags found on the page in a side-panel. Just navigate to any page, and Tag Assistant will tell you which tags are present. We will be adding additional diagnostics in the near future.\n\nThe “Troubleshoot” button activates our debug mode using tagassistant.google.com. This advanced tool allows you to debug your website, including iframes, within a single session, providing detailed diagnostics to help you validate, diagnose, and resolve your implementation. Session data is available for review on tagassistant.google.com. \n\nCOMING SOON: Step-by-step guidance to install tags on popular website builders.\n\nBy installing this extension, you agree to the Google Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/."
