You can choose to avoid capturing sensitive data. Once you have completed your recording, the Blueprint Task Capture automatically populates this information back into the Enterprise Automation Suite as a Digital Blueprint.\n\nOnce in the Enterprise Automation Suite you can immediately see what percentage of the actions can be automatically mapped into the RPA platform youâ€™re using to deliver your automated process. This enables you to prioritize automation candidates based on speed and value delivery. It also enhances and accelerates RPA design and development with the rich contextual information captured by automatically delivering it to your RPA tool of choice. \n\nThis plug-in only works with the Blueprint platform and is required to record detailed information for browser interactions.  Because of this, specific permissions are required for installation and use.\n\nBlueprint is a leading provider of digital process discovery, design, and management solutions to Fortune 1000 organizations. Enterprises across the globe have been leveraging the capabilities of the Blueprint platform to build mission critical systems for over 15 years.\n\nFor more information on Blueprint, visit www.blueprintsys.com"
