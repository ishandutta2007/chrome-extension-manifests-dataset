Are they finding it unstructured? Are users able to locate the call to action on your signup page?\n\nThe blurry-eye test (also known as the squint test) is a test that allows you to identify if a webpage has a clear pattern or structure by blurring it. If the structure disappears, then chances are your users are having a hard time navigating your website.\n\nThis extension allows you to blur any webpage, and will keep it blurred while you interact with it. If you navigate to a new page, you will have to re-blur it.\n\nInspired by this blog post: http://ixd.prattsi.org/2020/03/blurry-eye-test/"
