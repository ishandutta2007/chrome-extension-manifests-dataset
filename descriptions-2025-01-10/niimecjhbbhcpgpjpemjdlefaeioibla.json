You may be in a rush to finish your week. Or you could be drowning under so many requests from colleagues, friends, anyone... Design feedback, project explanations, pitch deck reviews, code PRs, copywriting reviews, that's a lot. Get back to them using your voice, and it will be easier.\n\nIt complements writing. You just buckled that documentation piece. But you fear that it looks hard to get in. Add some audio messages to make it easier to navigate. And get that piece communicated for real.\n\nIt conveys nuances. Working with others also means expressing feedback or structuring complex intentions. Giving feedback can be touchy, and written messages can feel too harsh. Try with your voice."
