For this purpose, artworks from so-called pools (exhibitions) are loaded from a server and integrated into the respective display when webpages are loaded. KUNSTSURFER is understood by the KUNSTSURFER collective as a digital art space, with which the surfing experience in the web can be extended with artworks. The KUNSTSURFER collective consists of curators and designers who are developing alternative formats of online art education.\n\nKUNSTSURFER is a browser ad blocker extension that is installed directly on the Browser and modifies some of its functions. However, instead of only detecting and hiding online advertisements, it replaces them with artistic content. Art Surfer brings art into your daily surfing. It takes over the commercial space, playing with its online appearance and marketing strategies."
