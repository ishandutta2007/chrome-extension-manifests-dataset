May need to refresh any tabs with Disqus comments that were opened before installing the extension. Disqus appears to have added a feature where admins can remove visible downvotes, so this extension may be less necessary than it used to be.\n\nThis extension is open source under the MIT license and its code is available here: https://codeberg.org/DrewNaylor/no-downvote-display/\n\nChanges in version 0.3:\n- Added support for Manifest v3. Only doing this because I have several users on Chrome/Chromium-based browsers and I want to make sure they can still use it.\n\nChanges in version 0.2.1:\n- The icon is now rendered from a source SVG file for better visual clarity.\n\nChanges in version 0.2:\n- Downvotes are now hidden on user profiles and in notifications."
