Don't use it like a Ouija board.\n\nMany parts of The Bible remain unexplored by many people. This extension actually picks one verse of The Bible (hence the title) and then brings you to the chapter that verse is in. In other words, big huge chapters of The Bible have a larger probability of you landing there because they have more verses.\n\nDon't skip boring or difficult chapters if you land on them - that defeats the purpose! Instead, research the context and try and figure out why it's in there."
