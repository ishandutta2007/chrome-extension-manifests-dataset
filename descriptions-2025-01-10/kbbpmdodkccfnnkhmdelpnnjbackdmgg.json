You could unfollow someone, but that doesn't prevent you from seeing their comments or posts in groups and events.\n\nOr you could block someone, but that's a rather heavy-handed solution. The blocked person might figure out that they've been blocked, which is not always what you want.\n\nGhosted makes the offending party's comments and posts fade or vanish. But if you need to see a ghosted person, it takes just 1 click to restore them to full visibility.\n\nUseful for trolls, embarrassing relatives, frenemies, and jilted lovers.\n\nGhosted is completely unoffocial and not affiliated with Facebook, Inc. in any way."
