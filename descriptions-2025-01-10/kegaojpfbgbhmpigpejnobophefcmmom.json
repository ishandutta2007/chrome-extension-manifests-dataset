Developer life will be so easy with this library and makes code clean and crisp. It has lot of operators and requires a steady process to get hold of them. This browser extension helps you learn all operator by reminding you everyday and sends your way a new RxJs operator to learn. It provides examples to understand each operator clearly and also compares different operators where required to differentiate. Learn at your own pace by navigating to next and previous operators. You can also use this extension to search and find any operator for quick reference. Also find Stackblitz link to each operator to play with the operator. All operators are consolidated under a single Stackblitz project to quickly access any operator and play with them."
