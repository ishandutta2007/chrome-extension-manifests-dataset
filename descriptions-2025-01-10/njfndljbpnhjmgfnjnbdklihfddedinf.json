Also sends a push notification to devices registered at https://twilio.girlslab.org. If you notice something that shouldn't be happening, send me a message at ceichman7@gmail.com and I'll see what I can do. Cheers!!\n\nTroubleshooting: \n1. Make sure audio on your VM and local machine are both turned up.\n2. Make sure audio redirection via RDP is enabled.\n3. Refresh the page and make sure you click on the page to make it active before you walk away.\n4. For mobile notifications, make sure your Avatara username is spelled exactly the way it is on the Twilio page (case-sensitively)."
