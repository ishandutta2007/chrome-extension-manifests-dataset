It was painful to copy the timestamp and then convert it to get the actual time. This extension fixes this by transforming the timestamps on the page, so you can navigate through your logs without any problems.\nYou can set the formats you want to see the date(time) in and also choose a range between which you want the dates to be auto formatted. Also, you can conveniently disable this extension for certain sites."
