Many things don't look good, some may not function very efficiently. Don't worry about your data though since this extension only reads it and never write on it.\n\nSome features from this extension have made it and more may make it into the tracker itself eventually (and look a hundred times cooler for sure).\n\n1.6.5 changelog :\n- Fixed an issue with rounds not properly ending in the round history."
