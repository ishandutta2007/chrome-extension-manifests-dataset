Each time you guess, the tiles change color to show how close your guess was to the word. The green tile means that the letter is in the correct position of the word; the yellow tile means that the letter is in the word but not in the correct position. The red tile means that the letter is not in the word. \n\nHere's the twist: after the first guess only the leftmost column of tiles change color; after the second guess only the leftmost two columns of tiles change color, and so on. \n\nGood luck and remember to have fun!"
