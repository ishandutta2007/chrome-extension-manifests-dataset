It allows you to generate and securely store an encryption key. TracerKey is transformed into a keysafe, containing your unique encryption key.\n\nTracerDoc is a web application that allows you to secure, store, and share files on a web 3.0 storage platform. \nTracerDoc comes with the TracerKey browser extension.\n\n-\tTracerKey secures your files by encrypting them (the encryption is done locally in your browser).\n-\tTracerDoc saves your files to either Public IPFS or Private IPFS.\n-\tYour encrypted file is only transported to the storage point via the secure https protocol, which adds an extra layer of security during file transport.\n-\tTracerDoc will share your files to the partner/contact you specify.\nInitially, you must invite your contact to TracerDoc; once your contacts are on TracerDoc, you become collaborators and both of you can exchange public keys.)\n\nFirst use:\n\nTo begin, you must create a password to safeguard the keysafe. \nThis password will allow you to open the keysafe each time TracerDoc is used. \nAfter you've established your password, you'll need to generate your encryption key. \nYou must memorize it or write it down and save it somewhere safe. You must re-enter your mnemonic phrase to confirm its creation.\n\nDon't store your mnemonic phrase digitally.\nDon't send your mnemonic phrase by email.\nDon't share your mnemonic phrase with anyone.\n\nYou will need your mnemonic phrase in case you want to reinstall the extension TracerKey. \n(See below the section to import an existing key)\n\nImport your TracerKey account:\n\nTo import an existing encryption key, you must enter your mnemonic phrase, which is composed of the 12 words in their proper order. You must also set your keysafe password to secure the storage of your imported key. \nThis is the only feature for which TracerKey may require you to re-enter your mnemonic phrase. In no other case will TracerKey or TracerDoc direct you to enter your mnemonic phrase again.\n\nImportant : \n\n-\tIf you forget your mnemonic pass and/or TracerKey keysafe password, you will not be able to access TracerDoc, and retrieve your documents.\n\n-\tNever keep your TracerKey passphrase on your computer, memorize it or write it down on paper and keep it somewhere safe that only you have access to.\n\n-\tThe servers of TracerDoc and TracerKey never store your encryption key. Your encryption key stay on your computer within the TracerKey keysafe.\n\n-\tTracerDoc will never ask you your mnemonic phrase."
