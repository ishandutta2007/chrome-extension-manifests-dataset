The tool ranks journals based on the Eigenfactor Score and then colors the journals accordingly.  Users can quickly glance at the colors to identify high influential journals.  We will be extending this to articles in the near future. \n\nThe journal and article-level rankings are based on pubmed content.  This includes more than 16 million citations from more than 5 million citing papers and cited references.     \n\nThis is a free tool developed by Geoff Davis at Google, Jevin West and Carl Bergstrom at the University of Washington.  \n\nPrivacy notice.
