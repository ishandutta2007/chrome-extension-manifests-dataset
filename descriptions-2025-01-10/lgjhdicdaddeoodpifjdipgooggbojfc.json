Stop accidental pull requests to the wrong repo with Safe Pull Request. This extension ensures your PRs target the correct repo, saving you from unwanted code leaks, embarrassing mistakes, and unnecessary spam to upstream maintainers.\n\n**Key Features**\n* Default Target Repo: Automatically sets the default pull request target to the current fork, instead of the upstream repository.\n* Code Leak Prevention: Avoid accidentally exposing sensitive or private code to the wrong audience.\n* Spam-Free PRs: Prevent spamming upstream maintainers with accidental PRs.\n\n**Who Is This For?**\nSafe Pull Request is designed for developers who work with forked repositories and use the GitHub web interface to create pull requests. If youâ€™ve ever accidentally opened a PR against the upstream repo, this extension is for you.\n\n**Why Install Safe Pull Request?**\n1. Protect Your Code\n* When you accidentally open a pull request against the upstream repo, your code can be exposed to anyone with access to that repo. Even worse, if the upstream repo is public, your code will be visible to the public Internet. Safe Pull Request eliminates this risk by setting to your fork as the default target repo.\n\n2. Save Time and Avoid Embarrassment\n* Mistakes happen, but accidental PRs can spam the upstream maintainers. And frankly, accidental PRs are just a bit embarrassing! Safe Pull Request helps save the maintainers' time and save YOU from being fallible. Because you're not. You're perfect.\n\n**Limitations and Known Issues**\n* Future Feature: Ability to configure the default target repo on a per-repo basis.\n* Known Issue: PRs opened from the /branches page are not currently handled properly, meaning they could target the upstream repo. This will be addressed in the next release.\n\n**Licensing**\nSafe Pull Request requires a valid license key to activate. Different types of licenses are available depending on your use case.\n\nHow to Get a License: Visit safepullrequest.com to purchase a license. Then enter the license key in the extension interface.\n\n**How It Works**\nOnce installed and activated, Safe Pull Request seamlessly integrates into the GitHub web interface. When you open a PR from a forked repository, it ensures the default target is your forked repo.\n\n**Install Now and Code with Confidence**\nEliminate code leaks, avoid upstream spam, and streamline your workflow. Install Safe Pull Request today and never worry about PR mistakes again."
