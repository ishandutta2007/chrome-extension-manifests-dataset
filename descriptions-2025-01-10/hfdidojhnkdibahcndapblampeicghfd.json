They manage huge databases of compositions, song-writers, and publishers.  If you're doing composition research -- \"Who is Billy Joel's publisher?\" or \"What percentage of 'I Choose You' does Sara Bareilles own?' -- you have to look in three separate places.  Why not search all of these sites at the same time?  Enter Song Search.\n\nInside of the Song Search Chrome extension, users can search by title, composer, publisher, artist, catalog number, or ISWC number. Song Search launches new tabs and that target the appropriate search results on ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC's websites."
