When you want to go back to it, just type \"to/read\" in your search bar and it should redirect you. \n\nYou can add whatever short-link name you wantâ€”though they'll all begin with \"to/\".\n\nDetails:\n- You can add up to 4000 short links in the extension \n- If you already use Go-links, this can work alongside that product since it uses a different prefix: \"go/\"\n- This works entirely in your client and doesn't share data with external services. Feel free to inspect the source code at any time on Github: https://github.com/NaimKabir/personal-golinks\n- This doesn't sync across devices, to minimize data shared beyond your client. If syncing across devices is something you'd prefer, please write into support"
