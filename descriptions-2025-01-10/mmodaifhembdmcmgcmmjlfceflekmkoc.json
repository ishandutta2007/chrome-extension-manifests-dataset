Some examples include:\n\nCausing problems when people want to unsubscribe from a newsletter\nHiding registration options so people feel the only way to register is through social media\nShowing pricing in an unclear way to get users to go towards a specific package (that may not necessarily be the best package)\n\nIn other words, arguably unethical trickery on the end users to gain something, whether intentional or not."
