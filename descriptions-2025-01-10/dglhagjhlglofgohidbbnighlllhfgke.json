Execute commands by dragging through the circle’s regions in order.\n\nNavigating to a menu item becomes a single gesture. The real value comes with repetition – users go from navigating a menu to inadvertently learning a gesture. There is no limit on how fast gestures can be performed.\n\nHow it works:\n1: Summon CS using ctrl+right click or by double right clicking\n2: Drag around the circle to select a menu item\n3: Release to execute the command \n4: The space is reused allowing multiple commands to fit within the small footprint\n**Important** : Extensions cannot run on internal chrome pages such as new tab.\n\nCommand Stick offers rapid access to:\n→ dial scrolling\n  dial zooming\n  scroll to top\n  scroll to bottom\n  new tab, close tab\n  toggle full screen\n  refresh page\n  zoom reset\n  copy, paste, cut\n  delete, undo, redo\n  share (Twitter)\n  select all, unselect all\n  audio accessibility assistance\n  navigation on select webpages \n  and more!\n\nBy default CS summons on second right click – this will display the context menu on initial right click and CS on the second. To swap CS to primary right click, toggle the option in the context menu.\n\nWe are currently developing the framework for users to configure custom commands – watch this space! \n\nPlease note:\nOur service is free, no paid edition & no advertisements. Command Stick™ is fully patented. \n\nCommand Stick does not work on Chrome's built-in pages e.g. new tab, because of \nGoogle's security restrictions.\n\nFor new feature announcements or just to say hello, follow @CommandStick"
