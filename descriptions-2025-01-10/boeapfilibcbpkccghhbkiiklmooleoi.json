Lucidity makes it easy for anyone to shop sustainably by highlighting the \"good\" and the \"bad,\" no research required. Lucidity combs through Amazon results and checks a few factors to determine whether each clothing item is considered \"fast fashion\": fabric materials, ratios of said materials, clothing manufacturers, and price. If items are deemed fast fashion, they are flagged. For flagged items, links to eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and Depop are provided to encourage shopping secondhand if such items are still desired."
