'f' for fullscreen)\n ► download button for every video\n ► add subtitles easily from hard drive or url\n ► starts video where you left\n ► theatre mode and picture-in-picture mode\n \nAnd on the most common streaming sites the OpenVideo player will be embedded automatically.\n \nAlso there is a built in video search engine (doesn't overwrite your default search engine) and a library where you can manage your video history and your playlists.\n\nThis addon uses Google Analytics so I can see which streaming hosts are most commonly used. This data is anonymous and can't be connected to individual users. This data important to keep up the high functionality rate of this addon, however you can turn it off in the extension's options."
