This extension uses the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that encourages people to work with the time they have, rather than against it.\n\nWith Pomodoro Timer, you can break your work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as 'pomodoros', the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that was first used by the technique's developer.\n\nKey Features:\n\n- Easy-to-use interface: Start, pause, and reset the timer with a single click.\n- Customizable timer settings: Adjust the length of your work intervals and breaks to suit your needs.\n- Notifications: Get notified when it's time to take a break or get back to work.\n\nWhether you're a student, a professional, or anyone in between, Pomodoro Timer can help you stay focused, maintain productivity, and reduce fatigue. Try Pomodoro Timer today and discover the difference it can make in your work or study routine!"
