Hit him where it hurts - his dwindling empire. Don't put money into his pockets.\n\nIt's easy to avoid the Trump Tower, but only half of Trump's 500 companies contain his name.\n\nThis extension shows you when any companies owned by Trump appear on your current page. Click on the tooltip to make it go away.\n\nDid we miss something? Do you have an idea for an awesome feature? We'd love to hear your suggestions!
