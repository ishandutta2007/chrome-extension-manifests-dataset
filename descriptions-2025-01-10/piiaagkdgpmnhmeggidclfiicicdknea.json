It does not facilitate any trading activities. Rest assured that all your data is securely stored on your own machine and never transmitted to any external sources. Your privacy and data security are our top priorities.\n\nHow it works?\n\nThe extension consists of three main components:\n\n- Banner: A small banner at the bottom of the Trade Republic app website that displays instructions and useful information. The Banner component does not store any credentials, and you need to log in to the Trade Republic website manually.\n- Reader: A hidden code that listens to your interactions with Trade Republic. It captures the data you communicate with Trade Republic but does not store any credentials or personal data. The Reader component also requires you to log in to the Trade Republic website independently.\n- App: The application that presents the data collected by the Reader. You can access the app whenever you open a new tab.\n\nBoth the Banner and Reader components operate when you open and log in to your Trade Republic account. No data is stored during this process, and it is essential to note that they do not store any credentials. You have full control over your login process and need to provide the necessary credentials yourself.\n\nThe Reader actively listens and captures the data you communicate with Trade Republic based on your browser behavior. For example, when you click on \"Profile,\" the website calls Trade Republic servers to retrieve timeline data. When you click on a timeline for more details, the website fetches the corresponding timeline's detailed data. The Reader understands the data you send and receive, but it does not perform these actions on your behalf by default.\n\nIt's important to note that we never send any trading action data to Trade Republic. The Reader mostly receives data silently. However, within the Banner component, there is a button labeled \"Collect data automatically\" that allows you to mimic your browser behavior and collect data faster without the need for manual clicks.\n\nAll data is stored locally in a database called IndexedDB within your browser. The only information we collect is your Trade Republic ID, which helps us determine when you started using the extension."
