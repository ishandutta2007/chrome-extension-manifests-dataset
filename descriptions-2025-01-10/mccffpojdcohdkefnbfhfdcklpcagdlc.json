When repeatedly searching for multiple interesting words (which could be a large set), it would be useful to save those words and automatically search for them as the web page is updated. Pearls provides this functionality and allows you to specify sets of words per page, domain, or for all pages.\n\nYou should reload your pages after installing the extension.\n\nLast Update 1.0.9.1:\n\n- Added a backup button to ensure data safety for an upcoming Chrome update that might disable the extension after June 15\n\nGoogle Chrome is requiring extension developers to make major changes on how their extensions work. I am currently working on this and hope the migration can be finished soon before problems affect users. I am deeply sorry if this happens. Pearls has not received my attention in a while since my current job does not give me time to do more development at home. However, after this migration is finished, I do plan to give more time to Pearls and satisfy some common user requests."
