I also write articles on these development projects and development in general. Techniques covered in these articles are mainly web techniques like HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.\n\nCurrently AppGlobe is used (in addition to writing articles) as a site to showcase what Iâ€™ve developed, but will likely in the future also be used to receive requests for development assignments."
