An excellent tool for upper management, or small business owners, who need to see actionable data quickly (with a single click).\n\nNext to each stat is a link that allows you to quickly access the feature in the Wallet Administrative Portal for more details, if/when needed. Authentication is handled automatically by using your existing session from your browser. Simply log into the Wallet Administrative Portal and this plugin will immediately display the daily performance stats associated with your business: https://wall.et/MUD72ScV9idt\n\nThis plugin is intended for businesses that have already setup an account on the Wallet Platform. If you do not yet have an account, creating one is simple and free. Please visit the sign-up page to get started: https://wall.et/MUCG2ttrLFsU\n\nOnce your account has been setup, this browser extension provides you with useful stats throughout your workday, without having to keep the Wallet Administrative Portal open and idle in the background.\n\nIf you have any questions, requests, or feedback about this plugin, please contact us: chrome-webstore@wallet.inc"
