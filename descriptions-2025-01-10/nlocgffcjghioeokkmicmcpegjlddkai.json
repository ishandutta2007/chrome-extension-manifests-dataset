I find myself looking at articles briefly before saving them to read later on a stickynote or emailing to myself so I just wanted something simple I could save on Chrome. I wanted it to be a short-term solution (versus normal bookmarking) so once you were done reading, you could simple delete it. \n\nNothing else - barebones extension, hope you find some use for it."
