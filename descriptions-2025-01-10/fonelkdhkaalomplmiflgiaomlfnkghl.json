By default, this plug-in will prevent automatic navigation when you click on a link. Instead, two drop-down options will appear, the first option allowing you to scan the clicked link. Scan results will then populate on the right side of the page, stating if the link is malicious or not. If you wish to navigate to the page, you can select the second drop-down option. \n\nEmailPhishGuard is a free tool that leverages VirusTotal, another free online security tool to perform the scans . Note, this is not an alternative to other security tools such as antivirus. This tool is meant to provide another perspective when deciding on whether or not to click on a link that is present in your email.\n\nCurrently supporting Yahoo and Gmail."
