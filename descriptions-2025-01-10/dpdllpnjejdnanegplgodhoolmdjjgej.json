If you're like us, when something stops working, you start going a bit crazy until you understand that the problem lies in the service. \n\nIsDown.app offers a solution to that problem. You can easily monitor the issues from your favorites SaaS. Instead of going to each of the 30+ services you use every day, IsDown aggregates the information for you and warns you when something is wrong.\n\nThe Chrome extension serves as quick access to the service status. Easily search the status of more than 2000+ services. You can find the official status situation or if other users are having issues that the official source still didn't confirm."
