Good for new players as they are learning the game and also helps track what players have in their graveyard and exile so you don't have to repeatedly ask.\nCurrent Features:\n-Creates spaces to take private notes on players' boards.\n-Allows you to send cards from the native Spelltable search to players' boards for later reference.\n-Saves board state on window refresh.\nFuture features:\n-Give us some feedback, we'd love to hear some ideas!"
