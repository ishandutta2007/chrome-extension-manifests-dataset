This extension offers one-touch access to your most useful links, keeping them easily accessible without the hassle of searching through folders. We all know how bookmarks from last year tend to get forgotten, but there's a good chance you'll revisit a link saved just yesterday. That's where this extension comes in!\n\nIts focus is on simplicity and ease of use.👌 No extra authorization is needed — it works directly with Chrome’s API, so you'll have access to your browser history and favorite links from your current account.\n\nFeel free to share your feedback! Let me know if you find it useful or if there’s any additional functionality you’d like to see.👂😊"
