See some examples below:\n\nJIRA-123 - 1h 30m - working on stuff\nJIRA-222 - 45m    - developing that amazing feature in the website\nDEV-456 2h 10m fixing bugs in my Pull Request\n1m updating my worklog in Jira!\n\n## Getting Started ##\n\nBefore using it, you need to do two things:\n\n- Make sure you are logged in to your Jira instance in Chrome. The extension leverages the existing authentication cookie when it is present in the browser;\n- Open the Options page and configure the Jira Hostname, which needs to point to the API services*. For example: https://jira.atlassian.com.\nAfter that, click Test Connection to make sure the extension can reach Jira correctly. If so, click Save and you are good to go.\n\nIf by only providing the Jira Hostname the connection fails, you'll need to configure the Basic Authentication with your user and password. Also, depending on the authentication method of the Jira API, you'll also need to provide an app token. If that's the case, please consult your IT department to get one.\n\n*The extension uses the Jira Hostname to build the URL and API calls to the Jira instance like this: https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/search.\n\nFor questions, issues and feature requests, please visit https://github.com/alfeugds/jiraworklogtool/issues\n\nContributions are welcome!"
