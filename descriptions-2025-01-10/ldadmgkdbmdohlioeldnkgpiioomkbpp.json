With CritiPage, users can actively engage with online content, share their opinions, and contribute to a community-driven feedback system for various websites. This extension aims to foster a more interactive and informative online environment.\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. Commenting System: CritiPage integrates seamlessly into your browser and offers a user-friendly comment section for every web page you visit. Users can express their thoughts, share insights, ask questions, and engage in discussions with other users who have also commented on the same page.\n\n2. Rating Functionality: Alongside comments, CritiPage allows users to rate web pages based on their quality, content, usability, and overall experience. These ratings create a cumulative score that reflects the collective sentiment of users towards a particular website.\n\n3. Anonymity and User Profiles: Users have the option to comment and rate anonymously, but they can also create profiles if they wish to build a reputation and gain recognition within the CritiPage community."
