In the opened tab choose how you want your chat to be saved (as plain text, formatted HTML, CSV or a zip-file). \n\n- If you choose 'HTML'  images, stickers and other files in the chat will be embedded in the HTML file. They will still be kept in Facebook servers and might stop being displayed after some time due to their tokens expiration. \n\n- If you choose the 'zip file' option, the chosen items (images, stickers, videos, etc.) will be saved locally to your computer and will be displayed in your chat as long as they are kept in the same folder as the HTML file. You can choose the type of files you want to save locally.\n\nThe Time Intervals option is for setting random time intervals between requests that the extension is sending to Facebook servers to fetch messages. The fastest option is No interval. However, with big chats Facebook might cut the extension requests if they are too many, because it considers them suspicious. In this case, try choosing another time interval from the options.\n\n4) Return to the messages page and click the extension icon. You can choose the start and end dates of the download, to save a chat in parts.\n\n5) When the chat is ready, it will either be saved automatically to the default folder for downloads, or you will be prompted to choose a folder on your computer to save the file to (this depends on the settings of your browser).\n\n\n---\nFAQ: https://chatsavers.org/faq.html\n---\n\n\n-------\nSUPPORT: \n--------\nsupport@chatsavers.org\nhttps://facebook.com/chatsaver"
