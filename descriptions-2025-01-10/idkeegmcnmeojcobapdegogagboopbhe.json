This has the potential to inject malicious code if https://web.archive.org/ is compromised.  This feature is disabled by default.  The extension includes a warning about this, and a link to the warning is displayed when the CSS fix feature is turned on.\n\nTHERE IS A RECOMMENDED PERSONAL VERSION OF THIS EXTENSION THAT INSTEAD LOADS BLANK CSS FROM THE EXTENSION'S FILES THAT USERS CAN CUSTOMIZE.  READ ABOUT IT HERE:\n\nhttps://crappybot.blogspot.com/2018/10/quick-eb-fixer-update.html\n\n\nSmall javascript extension to sort of fix stuff.\n\nCorrects <img> sources on forum.expressobeans.com that match either \"http://expressobeans.com/remote/...\" or \"http://www.expressobeans.com/remote/...\" (broken) to \"http://expressobeans.com/visual/IS.php?id=...\" (working) so that the images display properly.  \n\nAlso fixes the links (that cause these problems) on \"discuss remotely\" pages on expressobeans.com .\n\nNEW:\n\nIf you're signed into the site, it'll show you some neat interactive charts.  If you prefer the standard charts, you can turn off the chart features from the extension's options menu at chrome://extensions/."
