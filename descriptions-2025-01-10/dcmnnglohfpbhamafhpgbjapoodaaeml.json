This is useful to gauge participation and equal voice in zoom meetings. The aggregated statistics are:\n- overall meeting effectiveness (effective talk time vs. overall meeting time)\n- summary of talk time for each participant\n- collaboration chart to gauge who was addressed by who\n- word cloud\n\nUsage:\nOpen the zoomstats panel (click on the extension icon in the toolbar) on the recording overview page. The extension will find the audio transcript link and download and parse the transcript to generate the statistics.\n\nSecurity & privacy note:\nThe extension does not access zoom directly but only interacts with your current view in the browser. You will need to be logged into zoom and on the recording page for the recording you want to analyze. All operations happen within the browser and in memory, the extension does not communicate with any 3rd-party services nor does it store any data on your machine."
