Turn on the subtitles for your Target Language\n2. Right Click the page --> \"Translate to [Native Language]\" \n\nAlternate Method (If target language subtitles aren't available):\n1.Turn on the subtitles in your Native Language\n2. Right Click --> Translate to your Target Language\n\n(Note: Some shows in the following languages may use hardcoded subtitles which means the extension won't work: Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese. \nHowever, Netflix seems to have updated them all so it should be fine, I just can't make any guarantees. If it is the case though, the alternate method will still work)\n\nYou can click the extension icon at the top right to customize text color, size, and opacity. There's also an on/off button up there too. Don't forget to turn off Browser Translation as well when turning off the extension (or just refresh the page).\n\n----\n\nHonestly, the Alternate Method is not ideal for me since the audio likely won't match the target language text. Other people have told me they still find it very useful though so you can decide for yourself. \n\nOther things I should mention:\nThis works on Microsoft Edge but I don't know how their translator compares to Chrome's\n\n*The accuracy is determined by Google Translate, not me! *\n\nIf you care, this is open source (the website link is the GitHub repo).\n\nI prefer to keep this a simple and unobtrusive extension but feel free to email me if you really think there's a feature I should add. Or you can just message me on Reddit at /u/DuhMeTreeUs"
