Points Path is the first award flight search engine that runs directly in Google Flights, and provides both the cash price and points price of every flight in a search. \n\nUsing Points Path is easy. Just install the extension and then search for your trip as you normally would with Google Flights. In addition to getting Google’s regular cash results, Points Path adds the points or miles price to each flight, and then lets you know which is the better deal for each one — cash or points.\n\n✈️ MULTIPLE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS ALL AT ONCE ✈️\n\nWhen two or more frequent flyer programs have availability on the same flight, Points Path lists all of them. Just click the \"i\" info icon under any points price to see every award that's available for that flight. Points Path also shows you which bank credit cards can transfer to each program. And if there's a transfer bonus available, Points Path will show that too.\n\n✈️ BOOK AWARDS DIRECTLY FROM GOOGLE FLIGHTS ✈️\n\nOnce you’re ready to book a flight, click through to the normal Google Flights booking page, where you’ll find the option to book directly with the airline using your points, right next to all the usual cash options. \n\n✈️ GLOBAL COVERAGE AND LIVE AWARD DATA ✈️ \n\nPoints Path works for both one-way and roundtrip searches, and on domestic and international flights across our covered airlines and their alliance partners. All points and miles data in Points Path is retrieved live from the airlines each time you search, so it's the most up-to-date pricing info available. \n\n✈️ FREE EXTENSION COVERS ALL THE MAJOR US PROGRAMS ✈️\n\nThe free version of Points Path covers the frequent flyer programs of American, Alaska, Delta, JetBlue, and United, and has all the functionality described above with no limitations. Our upgraded Points Path Pro subscription tier also adds Air Canada, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, and Qantas, with more airline programs to come. \n\n✈️ ADVANCED FEATURES IN OUR PRO TIER ✈️\n\nWith the Pro subscription tier, you can track prices and be alerted by email when a points price goes up or down, as well as turn on Delta Amex 15% discount mileage pricing in Points Path. You'll also get a 7-day points calendar on every one-way search, access to our Lufthansa First Class dashboard, and more.\n\nPoints Path is an all-in-one solution that ensures you’re always getting the best deal for travel, no matter how you pay!\n\nQuestions?
