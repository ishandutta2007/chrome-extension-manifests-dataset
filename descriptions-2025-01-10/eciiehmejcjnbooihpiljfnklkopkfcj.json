One such extension offers several useful features that can help you better understand and summarize long-form content. These features include automatic AI summary, manual summary, text splitting, and customized prompt entry.\n\nThe first feature, automatic AI summary, uses the OpenAI API to provide a summary of long-form content. OpenAI is a research laboratory that focuses on developing artificial intelligence in a safe and beneficial manner. The API provides access to powerful algorithms and models that can analyze and summarize large amounts of text. This feature is ideal for those who need to quickly skim through long articles or documents and get a quick summary of their contents.\n\nThe manual summary feature allows users to submit text to a ChatGPT, which is a large language model trained by OpenAI. The model can provide a summary of the text submitted by the user. This feature is useful when the automatic AI summary doesn't provide a sufficient summary, or when users need a more personalized summary of the content.\n\nThe text splitting feature is designed to help users better navigate long-form content. It allows users to split long pieces of text into smaller, more manageable chunks. This feature is useful for those who have difficulty concentrating or reading for long periods, or for those who prefer to break up their reading into smaller chunks.\n\nFinally, the customized prompt entry feature allows users to enter a custom prompt for the automatic AI summary. This can help the AI algorithm better understand what the user is looking for and provide a more accurate summary. This feature is particularly useful for those who are looking for specific information within a larger piece of content.\n\nOverall, these features make this Chrome extension a valuable tool for anyone who needs to quickly and efficiently summarize long-form content. Whether you're a student, researcher, or just someone who likes to read a lot, this extension can help you get the information you need in a more efficient and manageable way.\n\nVersion: 1.1.4\n1- Support for GPT4 added.\n2- Added more GPT models and removed deprecated ones.\n3- Added support to select different subtitle language for summaries.\n\nVersion: 1.0.6\nIntroducing Pro Features and improved ChatGPT integration.\n\nVersion: 1.0.2\n1- This version now automates ChatGPT via it's Pro version. This breaks long texts into chunks so the limit of ChatGPT isn't breached and you get the accurate summaries.\n\n2- In Pro version, we support getting Captions for Youtube videos and summarize them accordingly.\n\n3- More control on prompts that can be used on both OpenAPI and ChatGPT."
