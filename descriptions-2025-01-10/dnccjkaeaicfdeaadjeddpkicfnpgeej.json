This extension is also required, if you want to use the Facebook module of Sorting Social.\n\nFor example, want to see the top pins for any Pinterest board, or the top products for any Etsy shop? All you need to do is visit one of those pages in your browser, then click the extension button in your toolbar (it should light up when you visit a page it recognizes) and Sorting Social will open, displaying the posts that were found on the page you were visiting.\n\nTry these for example:\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/dailyshirtsnet/back-to-school/\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/SerguioRogetti\nhttps://www.facebook.com/postradamuspage/"
