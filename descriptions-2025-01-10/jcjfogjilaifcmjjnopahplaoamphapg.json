It provides a suite of tools aimed at simplifying workflows, enhancing navigation, and automating common tasks, making the work environment more efficient and user-friendly.\nKey Features of Bird Extension:\nAuto-Submit Tasks: Automates task submissions on RaterHub with two options:\nAuto Submit Real-Time: Automatically submits tasks when the timer reaches the exact estimated task time.\nAuto Submit Max-Time: Submits tasks a few seconds before the maximum allowed task time, ensuring no delays in task completion.\nQuick Task Action Buttons:\nYes, No, Sexually Safe, and Error Task Buttons: Allows you to quickly select task options like \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"Sexually Safe,\" and \"Error\" directly from the extension popup, saving time on repetitive clicks.\nAppropriate for All & None Buttons: Streamlines the process of selecting key task responses like \"Appropriate for All\" and \"None of the Above.\"\nTask Link Generator: Automatically retrieves and displays task links from the RaterHub task interface for easy access and quick reference. Includes a \"Task Links\" toggle to show or hide these links on demand.\n Real AET Header: Automatically insert helpful content or custom text into specific fields. The Real AET header updates task time display to show the \"Real Estimated Time\" for better time management.\nAuto-Paste Functionality: Copy content from your clipboard and instantly paste it into the task fields, saving time on manual entry. Includes an automatic submission feature once the text is pasted.\nVisual Enhancements:\nHalloween-Themed Header & Home Screen: Apply fun seasonal visual changes, including custom fonts, icons, and backgrounds that enhance the look of RaterHub during specific times of the year.\nDynamic Progress Bar Colors: Visually track your task progress with a color-changing progress bar that turns red as the task timer nears its end.\nCustom Copy and Search Tools: Quickly copy text from task options or initiate Google searches directly from RaterHub task pages, simplifying research and task analysis.\nWhy Install Bird Extension?\nThese features are designed to automate repetitive actions, improve the speed of task submissions, and make navigating RaterHub smoother and more efficient for daily users. Whether you're completing evaluations, submitting invoices, or needing quick access to support resources, Bird Extension reduces manual effort and allows you to focus on more important aspects of your work.\nPermissions and Why They Are Needed:\nactiveTab:\nThe extension needs to interact with the active RaterHub tab to perform task-related actions like submitting tasks, updating the task status, or playing completion sounds. For example, when the \"Yes\" or \"No\" button is clicked, the script interacts with the active tab to submit the respective task option.\nTabs:\nThe extension modifies tab titles for tasks, opens new tabs for Google searches when using the \"Copy\" feature, and manages task links dynamically. This permission allows the extension to control and manipulate these actions.\nScripting:\nThey are required to inject custom JavaScript into the RaterHub page to run automation scripts, such as task submissions, custom clipboard interactions, and dynamic UI updates (e.g., changing the task timer color or inserting buttons). The HalloweenHeader.js and AutoSubmitBar.js scripts rely on this permission.\nclipboardWrite:\nThe extension allows for copying task details to the clipboard and auto-pasting content into task fields. For example, when the \"Paste + Auto Submit\" button is used, clipboard data is automatically pasted into task fields.\nDownloads:\nThis permission is needed for downloading backups of task-related data (e.g., task links or timing data). This ensures users can save important task details and logs for reference.\ncontext menus:\nThe extension creates right-click (context menu) options, such as copying task-related content or generating task links. This allows for quick actions without needing to navigate through different menus.\nSessions:\nThe extension tracks recent session activity to manage tabs and handle tasks effectively. This permission allows the extension to keep track of open or recently closed task-related tabs, ensuring seamless interaction between tasks.\nOffscreen:\nNeeded for playing completion sounds offscreen, which is triggered when tasks are automatically submitted. This feature ensures users receive auditory confirmation of task completion without interrupting their work.\nEach of these permissions plays a crucial role in automating tasks, improving user interaction with RaterHub, and ensuring smooth functionality across different features within the Bird Extension."
