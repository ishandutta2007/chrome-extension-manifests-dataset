We pass on this commission to one of Ireland’s most prominent homlessness charities, Inner City helping Homeless. \n\nThe commission we receive is between one and ten percent of your purchase price and this is collected automatically in the background. You don’t have to do anything differently. \n\nIt doesn't cost you a cent. The payment is made by the retailer at no extra cost to you.\n\nWe work closely with Inner City Helping Homeless to support the adoption of sustainable housing models in Ireland, and to empower individuals to exit homelessness for good."
