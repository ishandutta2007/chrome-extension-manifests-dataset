You can then easily build automation tests from those recordings, and collaborate with other testers / devs in your team\n\n1) Build Multi-Step API tests in one-click from manual test sessions\n\nTestChimp analyzes the payloads observed to auto-suggest assertions and variables to define, enabling one-click creation of user journey API tests, making test creation a breeze.\n\n2) Generate UI test scripts easily\n\nTestChimp watches the UI replay to extract user interactions and the context it occurs in, to write code using intelligent locators. It analyzes key UI transitions to write meaningful assertions automatically, resulting in robust and thorough tests. \n\nThe generated tests can be exported as Playwright, Cypress or Selenium scripts, or run directly on TestChimp cloud.\n\n3) Share bug reports / sessions easily with TestChimp Permalinks\n\nTired of uploading bulky video files to Jira tickets / reports etc. Going back and forth with devs to communicate more context and troubleshoot? Each session captured by TestChimp gets a unique permalink - ideal for linking in bug reports, and sharing with devs for troubleshooting - without needing bulky video uploads.\n\n4) Simplified Exploratory Testing with TestChimp Context Menu Add-ons\n\nWant to input test credit card numbers? Invalid urls? A large text? TestChimp extension adds convenient access to common edge cases, valid / invalid inputs for quicker exploratory testing. It also adds dynamic value support such as current date,  random values etc. You can select any text and add them as a custom vocabulary item, giving easy access to commonly used domain specific inputs for your systems.\n\n#DevTools #ApiAutomation #UiAutomation #BugReporting #RecordReplay #QA #ManualTesting"
