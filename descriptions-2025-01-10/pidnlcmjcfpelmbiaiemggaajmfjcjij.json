Well, you're not alone! ðŸ˜…\n\nWeâ€™ve been there too, and that's why I created this extension to make things easier for you. With this extension, youâ€™ll find a \"Match Details\" button right in the notification. Just click it, and we'll take you directly to the match where you played with the banned player.\n\nEnjoy and good luck with your games! ðŸŽ®âœ¨"
