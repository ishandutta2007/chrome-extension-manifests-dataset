Everything you need and nothing you don't.\nIf you paste an image link in here it looks like this ❉ And hovering over it, shows you a thumbnail. Slicking on that thumbnail launched the image in a minimal style modal.\nThink of Notes as a scratchpad on the go, located in your next tab. Always handy.\nLinks is a place for you to store you most frequently visited sites. Simple as that.\nAdd, Delete and Reorder them as you wish.\n\nFinally we have Tasks, pretty straight forward, here's where you add things you need to get done.\nYou can hover over the Date and Time to get a quick check of a calendar widget and slicking on a date will prefill in a Task with that date in it.\n\nThese date drive tasks are easy to spot as they're led with a ✦ diamond. If you want to edit these Tasks, simply click on them and edit away.\n\nClearing Task is just as simple. User the Clear Clear Completed Task icon in the bottom right corner. That's pretty much it.\n\nOh, one last thing. ClearSlate was designed with minimalism in mind. There are a few customisation options behind the settings icon. Here you can select from a few select Google fonts, set the fonts size, and fonts weight, and choose between light and dark mode.\n\nThis is a side project. Totally free and totally private.\nThere’s no data collection, no ads, and no tracking. Everything is stored on your machine.\n\nThat's it!\n\nHope you find it useful,\nJohn Kappa"
