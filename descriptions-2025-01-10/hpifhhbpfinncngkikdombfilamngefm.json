Now you can follow the price of WDC without ever leaving your browser. WdcPricer also displays the current price right on the badge of the extension button and is updated as frequently as every minute depending on the frequency you choose on the options page.\n\nYou can also set price alerts that will display a notification if WDC rises above or falls below a threshold you choose. You can also choose how frequently the extension checks for price changes, but the minimum frequency is every minute. This is a hard limit imposed by Chrome itself."
