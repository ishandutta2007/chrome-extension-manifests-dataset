In order to add a link you should be a registered Links&News user. It is also necessary to have at least one page with a column of type \"Links\".\n\nHaving this extension installed just navigate to web page you want to add a link to and click the extension icon located to the right of browser's address bar. A popup will open. If you are not logged in it will ask you to log in. Then select a page from \"Page\" drop down list. Then select a column from \"Column\" drop down list. The extension remembers your choice and will restore your last page and column any time you open it. Fields \"Link Name\" and \"Link Address (Url)\" will be filled up automatically. You can edit those fields if you wish.\n\nTo add a link just click \"Add link to Links&News\" button. Then go to https://linksnews.azurewebsites.net/myPages and select a page you just added a link to. It will show the link at the end of links list in a column of your choice.\n\nEnjoy!"
