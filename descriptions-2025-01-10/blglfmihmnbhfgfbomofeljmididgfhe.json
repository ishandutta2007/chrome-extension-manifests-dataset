Simply install the extension, visit any website, and click on the extension icon to display the dataLayer content. The basic setup is compatible with the default dataLayer in Google Tag Manager.  \n\nThis extension also assists you in inspecting the dataLayer enabled through Customer Events on a Shopify store. To enable this feature, navigate to the settings page of the extension and activate the “Shopify Custom Pixel DataLayer Checker”. If you have not enabled the dataLayer through Customer Events, there is no need to make any changes—the default settings will function correctly.\n\n\nReady to inspect dataLayer ? Give it a try!\n\n\nYou found a bug ?\nPlease contact us on contact@growthacademy.io\nThank you for your help and your support!"
