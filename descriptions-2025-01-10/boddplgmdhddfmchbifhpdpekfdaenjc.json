Clicking this icon will open up the \"new visual submission\" page on Weasyl, prepopulated with as much information as Waxpost can gather.\n\nNote: imgur support requires viewing the image itself instead of a gallery page. The URL must start with http://i.imgur.com/ or https://i.imgur.com/.\n\nAt the moment, only visual submissions are supported. Submitting any other type will result in undefined behavior."
