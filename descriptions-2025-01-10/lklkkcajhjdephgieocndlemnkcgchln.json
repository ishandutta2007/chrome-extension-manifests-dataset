It is the 21st century and we are still stuck in the dinosaur ages when it comes to finding information on a webpage.\n\nSome things that set this extension apart from your default Ctrl+f search: \n\n- Loose Search! Lets be honest, who really knows how to spell? Not me! I made the perfect solution for just that. Find that word on the tip of your tongue without having to pull out the dictionary first.\n- Regular expressions. You can now search using variable string patterns. Want to find all numbers on a page? search for `\\d+`  BAM easy.\n- Multiple selections. Ever want to find two separate phrases at the same time? Now you can!\n- Copy selections to the clipboard. Yup, you can now copy all selected text to your clipboard. That'll make manual data scraping easier."
