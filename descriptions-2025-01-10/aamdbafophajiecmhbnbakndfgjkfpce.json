We highly recommend that you install this extension after you are done working for today as it can cause a high rate of refresh errors when it tries to index your dashboard for the first time.\nIn order to avoid this situation, you can install it at the end of day and allow it to run overnight by pressing the Sync button in the extension when you are ready to leave the computer. By morning it will be done, your CW account will be up to date, and you'll be ready to reap the extension's benefits. *\n\nCrowdWorkers of the world, unite! Join with other workers to help make Mechanical Turk a better place to work. You can make it easier for everyone to find good work, and to make a fair wage.\n\nCrowdWorkers is a tool for Turkers that allows them to track their hourly rate.\n\nRequires permissions to access data on following pages in order to track your time spent on them:\n - crowd-workers.com\n - mturkforum.com\n - mturkgrind.com\n - mturklist.com\n - reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor\n - reddit.com/r/mturk\n - tinychat.com/turktime\n - turkopticon.ucsd.edu\n - work.crowdsource.com\n - TurkerNation.com"
