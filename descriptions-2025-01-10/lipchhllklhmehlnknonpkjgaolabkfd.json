It is possible to register the authenticity of content published on the web, be it on websites, blogs, social media platforms or portals. Additionally, from the report, a hash - a unique and exclusive code - is calculated, which identifies your document on our website.  \n\nFor that, we use the most advanced technology: the blockchain. With a register on blockchain, it is possible to prove that the evidence was not modified, with the content being preserved even if the original publication is deleted. It has also an additional lawyer of protection with the timestamp, which indicates the precise date and time that the evidence was collected. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- The plugin can only be installed on Chrome browser. After the installation, we recommend that you reload the browser or the tabs with the content you want to collect.\n\n- In the case of social media, try to use the link to the specific post.\n\n- To use the plugin, simply click on the extension icon, which can be found on the top right corner of your browser.\n\n\nATTENTION: Some plugins might try to prevent PACWeb from running, so we suggest that you DEACTIVATE all the extensions on your browser before using it. Check also the LANGUAGE OF YOUR BROWSER to make sure that the report is generated in the language you need.\nThe report generated by our plugin will only have LEGAL VALIDITY if certified on our platform.\n\n\n- After collecting the content, a PDF file is generated, which will be automatically downloaded to your computer, and from which a hash is calculated on the OriginalMy website.\n\n- In order for the PDF to be valid as proof of authenticity, it is necessary to certify its hash on blockchain or authenticate the copy of the web page at the notary. Both can be done through our platform, with administrative fees to be paid. \n\n- In the case of Notarial Authentication, the content collected must be public so that it can be accessed by the notary. Please note that this is valid only in Brazil.\n\n- After payment, you can go to the OriginalMy website and submit the PDF file to check the certification status.\n\nThis tool is intended as a mechanism to collect additional evidence for court proceedings. Its legal validity is assured in Brazil, so please refer to your lawyer to inquire about the validity in your country. \n\nOriginalMy is a platform for the authenticity of files and documents, people and signatures, connected to four public blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and DeCred."
