Just click the UPCZilla barcode icon for a dropdown search box, enter the product name or UPC code you are looking for, and let UPCZilla do the rest.\n\nNew feature added: the UPCZilla popup now also includes a feed of \"Price Alerts\" - these are products found by our Price Tracker which have been significantly discounted since our engine last checked the price. These Price Alerts will be really useful if you resell things online, or if you are just looking for a bargain for yourself. It shouldn't affect your experience if you JUST want to use the search form - you can disable this feature using the checkbox."
