It can search for fast shipping, free shipping, move through search result pages, sort prices ascending and descending, reset single filters or all, search for free shipping, and search stores with coupons all within Europe.\n\nYou may want to install this extension if you are looking for faster delivery, don't want to pay taxes, want cheaper shipping with tracking, and prefer an ad-free user experience. The extension is free to use, but you can donate $5 per month if you wish to support the developers.\n\nThe extension does not collect any personal data, but if you choose to donate, the payment processor will collect your credit card number, CVV, and email. The extension uses the \"Read your browsing history\" permission, but this is only for the donation plugin's security.\n\nThe developers will update the extension regularly and add new functionalities, and all updates will be free. However, the extension may stop working if Aliexpress changes the way search results are obtained. There is no refund policy for the monthly donation since users are not buying the extension or service, but they can always use the free mode.\n\nThe most recent version of the extension is 4.0, which has been rewritten for better interaction, added logic for removing non-relevant items, and a new algorithm for searching in warehouses. \n\nv1.0: Initial version of the extension.\n\nv1.1: Added Free Shipping, Fast Shipping, and Has Coupon options. Edited the logic for resetting filters. Edited the manifest file.\n\nv1.2: Added Price ASC/Price DESC buttons, help text, reset buttons for Countries and Pages, rewritten code for Countries and Pages, rewritten code for reset logic, removed a bug when resetting selected country + page, added a content file, added tab permissions, and edited the manifest file.\n\nv2.0: No changelog available.\n\nv3.0a: Rewrote the code for Manifest v3, used the background file for tracking URL address, upgraded the donation plugin, rewrote the code for the popup (around 70% because of the new manifest), changed the UI to a black theme with gray buttons and new icons, added a new algorithm for searching in warehouses (Aliexpress changed), and added a new manifest file.\n\nv3.1: Edited the logic for search because Aliexpress made some changes.\n\nv3.2: Added a 1-month free subscription until 28.12.2022 to celebrate having 1000 active users.\n\nv4.0: Rewrote the code for better interaction with the extension, added logic for removing non-relevant items for fast and free delivery, rewrote the code for button initialization.\n\nv4.0.1: Edited fast delivery logic because AE changed some data on page"
