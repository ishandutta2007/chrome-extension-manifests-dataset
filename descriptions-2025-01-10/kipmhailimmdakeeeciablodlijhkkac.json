However, memorizing the words that you read doesn't come naturally. You have to work on it.\n\nThis extension will ease this job. \n\nIt lets you see the definition of a double-clicked word along with its pronunciation. However, this is not a striking feature as couple of other apps do it right now.\n\nYou can quickly see all the words that you have looked up each day. Apart from a dictionary app it is also a vocabulary builder. Like other apps it doesn't inundates you with so many words that you have never seen. Memorizing the words for which you have a context will be much easier.\n\nWE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE WORDS YOU LOOKUP!"
