Play a music video playlist or redzone over commercials during your football watch party, play a spotify playlist in between innings of a baseball game, play a live reaction stream of a basketball game during the game's commercials, or find your own specific use!\n\nTo use:\n1. Insert the YouTube video ID or YouTube playlist ID into the extension's settings (also works with many non-YouTube videos and Spotify) or skip this step to use the extension's default music video playlist.\n2. Go to live video stream that has commercials and play the stream in full screen.\n3. Click \"Ctrl + Shift + F\" and follow remaining instructions presented on screen.\n\nVideo on how to use and how extension works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DlAmCWWS4c\n\nExtension code can be viewed here: https://github.com/RG-O/YoutubeOverCommercials\n\nNot affiliated with YouTube or Spotify."
