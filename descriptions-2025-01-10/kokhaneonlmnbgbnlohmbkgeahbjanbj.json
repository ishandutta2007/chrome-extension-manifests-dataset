Participants have an interest in finding out how boards could have been played in order to achieve a better result. The function of the Bridge Solver Chrome extension is to extract the hand records from results pages for use by my Bridge Solver Online app, which performs analysis and enables the user to investigate the optimum line of play.\n\nSimply navigate in the browser to the page containing the hand diagrams. The extension's icon at the right of the address bar will change to a green background. Click on it to  acquire the deals. Makeable contracts, and par scores are calculated automatically. User selected contracts can be played interactively, with card by card guidance.\n\nFor further details see the website."
