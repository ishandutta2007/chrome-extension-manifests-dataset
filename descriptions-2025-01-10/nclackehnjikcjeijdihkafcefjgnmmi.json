No more needing to edit bookmarks manually, or struggling to remember your last page when you forgot to edit the bookmark.\n\nIt will also pop-up a notification whenever there is a new update on Homestuck.com.  If there are ever any additions to the epilogues, or if a brand new story gets posted, you'll know right away with this extension!\n\nOn the Options page, you can:\n- turn notifications on or off\n- upload a custom notification icon\n- upload a custom sound clip to play when there are updates\n- turn the page count on or off (if enabled, the button in the toolbar will show how many pages you have left to read)\n\nYou can find all the source code for this extension here: https://github.com/JMTyler/homestuck-notifier\n\nThe simplified Sburb house icon was created by Chris Howlett: https://howlettstudios.com\n\nHomestuck itself and all related trademarks belong to Andrew Hussie & VIZ Media.  The green house-like icon for this extension was inspired by the Homestuck Sburb icon, which belongs to Andrew Hussie & VIZ Media.\n\nThis extension was previously called \"MSPA Notifier\" back when Homestuck could be found on MSPaintAdventures.com."
