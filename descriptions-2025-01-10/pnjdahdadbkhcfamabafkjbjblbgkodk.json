Our primary objective is to maintain the project, ensuring it remains functional on the most recent browser versions and that any bugs are fixed.\n\nRikaitan turns your web browser into a tool for building Japanese language literacy by helping you to decipher texts which would be otherwise too difficult tackle. This extension is similar to 10ten Japanese Reader for Firefox and Rikaikun for Chrome, but it stands apart in its goal of being an all-encompassing learning tool as opposed to a mere browser-based dictionary. For the addon to work users need to download dictionary files from third party websites."
