Web pass allows you keep the password for the websites you visit. It is an app lock for your websites. It is simple to use, give it a URL and set the password, that's it. Next time, when you or someone else tries to open that site, you have to enter the password to get in. Also, add a master password for the extension that will allow you to add new sites for protection. Once you enter the password and open any site, it won't ask you any password for one hour. After one hour, it will ask you to enter the password again."
