The benefit of this is that you can set a snooze time, then archive that thread so that the thread is out of your inbox until the snooze elapses. Although Gmail does provide built-in snooze functionality it is not as flexible as Snoozifier.\n\nSnoozifier requires the following permissions:\n\n★ View and modify but not delete your email - This is general access to Gmail and needed to snooze the messages. Snoozifier does not read or alter the contents of your emails.\n\n★ View your calendars - This is needed to detect what timezone you are in so snoozed emails are woken at the correct time.\n\n★ Connect to an external service - This is used to log statistics of how many people are using Snoozifier. No personal information is logged.\n\n★ Allow this application to run when you are not present - This is needed to run the timers that check if snoozed emails need to be woken."
