Moreover, it's a small word that binds us all though we are miles apart. And we are definitely proud to be one. We have scaled the summit, proved ourselves as audacious fighters and yet there's still much more to do to retain our identity and show the world what we are capable of.\n\nIt's a nightmare that we can hardly remember our own date even when we are living here only. Now, we can imagine how hard it would be for Nepalese living abroad. Hence, with an effort to make life a bit more simpler than it is, we have developed a simple application that could be a part of you. There's nothing much but a simple calendar in our own native language helping us to keep track of our own culture and events thereby, making sure that we don't get left over from the events that we'd never want to miss. Imagine a sister getting a call at the exact day of 'Bhai Tika' or 'Raksha Bandhan' from a brother seven seas away, how would a sister feel? These subtle things counts a great deal when it comes to relationship. Taking these things into account, this is our native application to bind all the Nepalese round the globe.\n\nHope we have been able to touch the lives of many. In the days to come, we hope our small effort will flourish in a way every Nepali users will help us promote our work in the whole world."
