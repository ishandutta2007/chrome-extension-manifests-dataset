If I hadn't gotten a D on that essay, my grade would be a...\")\n- See your GPA per quarter / semester live, as grades change. \n\nThis extension works with both total point grading systems and weighted grading systems. \n\nMORE TO COME SOON!\n\nPS: This extension is still in beta, there will probably be bugs here and there. Please report back to Eric if you find a bug."
