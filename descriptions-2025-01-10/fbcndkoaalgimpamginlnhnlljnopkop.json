The permissions and privacy management settings can be hidden and not easy to access. It gets even more complicated if you want to delete your account.\n\nSocial Permission makes each of those tasks very simple as it provides a unified interface to your privacy and permission settings to all major social sites. It will display an icon on a supported page giving you one click access to:\n\n* The access permission management page\n* The privacy settings management page\n* The delete account page\n\nNote: The delete account links will not directly delete your account! You will always need to confirm the cancellation of your account.\n\nCurrently all mayor social sites are supported. For a complete list please go to www.social-permissions.com.\n\nMissing your favorite site? Contact us at support@social-permissions.com\n\nNote: As this is a service provided free of charge we do not take any responsibility for the actions caused by using this tool. Use it on your own risk!\nIcon by: http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/"
