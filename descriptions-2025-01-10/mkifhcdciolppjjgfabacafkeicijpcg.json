It's way faster than making and sharing docs, but the same real-time collaboration.\n\nYour coeditors can open the link on any device and instantly collaborate, they don't need to create accounts or login. Only you can send your email.\n\nThis extension will not ever access your inbox, just the draft text when you push the coedit button. This free beta version is for non-commercial use only.\n\nAll you need is a Google account and collaborators to help you write. \n\nDo you have ideas for improving coedit.email or see an issue? \nPlease let us know: help@coedit.email"
