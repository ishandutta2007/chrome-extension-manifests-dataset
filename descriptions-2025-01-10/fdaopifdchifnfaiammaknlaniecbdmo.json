Some uses:\n• custom labeled bookmarks/favorites\n• avoid making accounts on each specific site using their custom system\n\nMore features:\n🕶 Option to use a dark theme (your device's theme is used by default)\n📚 View and manage your history\n\nSee all of our release history here: https://github.com/emogit/emojit/releases\n\nGot feedback? Issues? Badge ideas? Share them at https://github.com/emogit/emojit/issues\n\nWhat we store:\nWe only store information in our database when you add or remove an emoji (reaction) for a page. We store:\n• a randomly generated user ID to represent you\n• the URL of the page you're looking at \n• the emoji you reacted with (or removed) for that URL\n• the day and time you added the emoji\n• badges that you earned\nYou can delete your current and all past interaction for a URL through this extension.\nYou can download or delete all of the data we're storing on you through the extension's options.\n\nWe care about your privacy! We will not store long URLs because they might have identifiable information in them.\n\nWe will not sell this raw data. This contains our own browsing data as well as the data of our friends and family, so we really do care about its security. We might one day sell access an aggregated anonymized version of this data. For example, to let a website owner only see all of the emojis used on their site in a given month (they would not get the user IDs or any personally identifiable information). In other cases, we might share times of reactions to a page but we would modify them (for example, by rounding to the nearest hour). This can be useful to help website owners know how people's perception of a page changes over time and the site owner can learn this well enough without knowing anything about you. If we do start to share any non-aggregated data externally, it would only be new data (we would not share data already stored before a specific date), and we will update this text and identify it in Google's privacy and data usage information for this extension's information.",
