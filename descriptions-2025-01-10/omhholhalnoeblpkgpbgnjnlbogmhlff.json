This will add it to your routes in the dynamicWatch system. You can also set it as your current route in the popup that is shown.\n\nThen just start dwMap on your Garmin watch or routeCourse on your Garmin Edge GPS and the route will be immediately downloaded to the device.\n\nNote that some of the import source websites may require that you are logged into your account on the website, and that your account includes a paid option on the website, in order for your routes to be available for exporting.\n\nWith the dynamicWatch Chrome Extension you don't even need to visit our website to send exciting new routes to your Garmin device. It's that simple!"
