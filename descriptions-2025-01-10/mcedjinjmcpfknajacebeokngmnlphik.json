It will then insert these issues, along with their current status, right into the GitHub UI alongside the labels.\n\n* No JIRA plugins necessary\n* Authentication is done simply by acting as the user you are logged in as on JIRA.\n* Minimal permissions required, only needs access to websites you configure.\n* Specify exactly which GitHub repositories you want connected to which JIRA installations.\n\nThis project is open source, and you can find it here: https://github.com/samlanning/github-jira-links"
