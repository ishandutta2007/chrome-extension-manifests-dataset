Adding Tabrary to Chrome means that you can display all your open tabs and bookmarks together as a tiered library, so that you can easily organize your tabs into bookmarked folders according to activity or project, move tabs between folders, or remove tabs from your library altogether--all while browsing normally.\n\n* Drag and drop tabs to save, organize, and retrieve your bookmarks\n\n* Save memory by reducing the number of tabs in you main window\n\n* Create new folders and rename bookmarks without opening the bookmark manager\n\n* Build your Tabrary to organize browsing thoughts by project and topic folders\n\n* Add, view, and organize local pdf files"
