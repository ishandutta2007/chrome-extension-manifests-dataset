This allows for restrictions on media control and simulation of expected behavior to ensure that all pages behave normally. Main and most requested feature: this blocker has a customizable white list, so you may add your favorite sites to exclude from blocking autoplay. To deactivate a function, simply uncheck the related item from toolbar-panel. With this extension you will never have to worry about videos auto playing in the background. In addition, the video will be automatically buffered if necessary."
