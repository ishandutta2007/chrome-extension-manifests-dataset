As the size of the product collection increases alongside its corresponding number of categories, it can become progressively difficult for shoppers to view the items on offer\nwithout having to continuously scroll through the webpage or open new tabs for each desired product of interest. Thus, this project aims to fill this gap between the current state of retail websites and an improved state by extracting products from the current tab and displaying these in an alternative interactive 3D manner to enhance a userâ€™s browsing experience.\n\n- Use left click to select the product, this will bring you to the product webpage\n- Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out \n- Use the slider button in the bottom left to increase the size of images\n- Use the mouse pointer to rotate the globe"
