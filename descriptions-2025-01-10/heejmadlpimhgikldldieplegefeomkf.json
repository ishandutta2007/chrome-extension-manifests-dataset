This add-on to Pepper Flow allows your company to review web pages and apps in their interactive, native format, regardless of the web content management system you use. The result? Your team saves time and improves communication during the review process.\n\n\nANNOTATE DIRECTLY ON WEB CONTENT\nInstead of commenting on a PDF of screenshots, place annotations directly on the web page. Other Pepper Flow users will see these annotations right where you left them, enabling them to view comments and confirm functionality in context. \n\nTAKE SCREENSHOTS FOR EASY RECORDKEEPING\nKeep track of what your team reviewed with screenshots. Select the type of screenshot you’d like, and Pepper Flow will do the rest, saving the screenshots for later version comparison or audit needs.\n\nCOMPLETE AN ENTIRE JOB WITHIN THE EXTENSION\nPepper Flow Digital Review also provides other capabilities to help you complete your web jobs, such as viewing task progress, editing metadata, managing assignees, and downloading review summary reports.\n\nACCESS WEB CONTENT FROM PEPPER FLOW\nAccess digital content from the Pepper Flow library, jobs board and notifications.\n\nFor more information on Pepper Flow Digital Review, visit https://www.vodori.com/products/pepper-flow-digital-review"
