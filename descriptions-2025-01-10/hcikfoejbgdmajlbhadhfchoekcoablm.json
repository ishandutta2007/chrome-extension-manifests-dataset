YOUR CHAT DATA WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR COMPUTER. WE DO NOT COLLECT PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION EITHER. WE WILL ONLY CONTACT YOU WITH YOUR DIRECT CONSENT\n\nThis extension is 100% privacy-safe 💯. We DO NOT collect your chat data or personal information. We will NEVER sell your data to any third-party companies in any shape or form. Cooby Inc. is a U.S.-based company that complies with U.S. laws.\n\nThe permission requested on Google Chrome while installing Cooby might sound scary, but it's far from the real needs of the extension. The permissions are technically required for the following reasons:\n\n- Read and change your data on cooby.co and web.whatsapp.com: Required to add tabs to the top of WhatsApp Web. We don't collect any chat or contact data from your WhatsApp.\n- Read your browsing history: As scary as it sounds, we only need this permission strictly for the One-Click to WhatsApp Web (WAW) feature. We do not collect your browsing history at all. In fact, this is the \"tab\" permission from the Chrome Developer Guide, which DOES NOT allow us to read your browsing history. It only allows us to know what tabs are open right now.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————— \n\nCONTACT US \n\n————————————————————————————————————————\n\n For any concerns or feedback, please feel free to email support@cooby.co.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————— \n\nLEGAL \n\n————————————————————————————————————————\nWhatsApp is a trademark of WhatsApp Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.
