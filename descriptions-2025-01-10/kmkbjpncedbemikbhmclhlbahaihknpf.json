If two people have a given item on their list and one of them has it at position 2, and the other at position 3, Thatsmybis.com will show a 2 for Player A and a 3 for Player B. This is a good system but not every guild follows this system as it is laid out and some want the flexibility to use a third party priority system.\n\nThis extension will allow loot priority display to be controlled by linking to an external Google spreadsheet (exported automatically to comma separated values) which should be configured as a single column with a list of raider names top to bottom to indicate loot priority. Using extra columns or superfluous formatting on your priority list could cause the code to fail."
