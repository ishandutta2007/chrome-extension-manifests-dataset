Instead of managing dozens of tabs in one window, split them into sessions. All your sessions are saved to a dedicated folder in your bookmarks.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n* It lets you save all your tabs and groups as a session. \n* You can create as many sessions as you want (simply open a new window and save it by clicking the \"Save current session\" button).\n* In order to switch to a session - simply click it via the Tabbouleh extension menu. This will close your current session/window and open the chosen session.\n* In order to open a session in a new window, without closing the current one, simply middle-click the session.\n\n* It also closes duplicate tabs automatically to reduce clutter (this functionality can be turned off via the Tabbouleh extension menu)\n\nWhat it doesn't do:\n\n* It doesn't track your browsing history.\n* It doesn't rely on a server. Everything happens in your browser.\n* It doesn't share your information with a 3rd party."
