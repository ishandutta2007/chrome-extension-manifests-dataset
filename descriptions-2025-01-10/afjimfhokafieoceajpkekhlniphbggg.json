It animates an unobtrusive border around sites you visit to remind you to breathe, stay present, and repeat an optional mantra (or prayer or intention). \n\nFEATURES\n‚Ä¢ Animate your browser with beautiful mandalas\n‚Ä¢ Select from common mantras, or write your own prayer or intention for the day\n‚Ä¢ Customize a breathing pattern (pranayama) to focus your breath \n‚Ä¢ Customize the Mala display colors, fonts, and size \n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n1. Add the Mala extension to your Chrome browser.\n2. Click the Extensions icon (üß©) in the top right of you browser, then click Mala to customize the display.\n\nüí° Pro Tip: click the pin icon (üìå) to make Mala easy to access in your browser bar.\n\n\n\nWHY IS IT CALLED MALA?\nMala combines a very ancient and very modern technology. Traditional mala beads are used in a variety of spiritual lineages to help a practitioner focus on a particular intention or prayer. The Mala Chrome Extension takes this same concept and brings it to the modern web!\n\n\nSECURITY & PRIVACY\nMala does *not* collect or share any data about you or the sites you visit. \n\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPER‚Ä®\nAs the sun rises each morning, I get out of bed and begin the day with a seated meditation. Focusing on my breath, I observe thoughts arising and passing by, like clouds amidst a vast blue sky. In this spaciousness there is a deep sense of peace and joy.\n\nYet a few minutes later I open my laptop and am quickly met with a sea of emails, messages, and stories of things I have to do. Often within minutes I notice my breath shortening, heartbeat quickening, and anxiety rising. Where has the peace gone that I felt only moments earlier?! ‚ÄúTake a deep breath,‚Äù I remind myself. Ah, right!\n\n‚Ä®I built Mala as a simple tool to remind myself of the stillness and beauty that I know is available to us in each moment. I offer it as a gift to you, hoping you find it useful in your daily journey. Please pass on the love. \n\nWith Gratitude,‚Ä®\nBen"
