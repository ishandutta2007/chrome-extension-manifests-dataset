Now, to visit that website, simply type '/' and space in the search bar or omnibox, followed by your shortcut. \n\nSlash Space Go will instantly navigate to the linked website. Simplify your browsing experience with Slash Space Go!  \n\nSlash Space Go! is a powerful browser extension designed to revolutionize the way you navigate the web. With this tool, you can create custom shortcuts for your most frequently visited websites, making browsing faster, more efficient, and personalized to your needs.\n\nImagine this: You're working on a project and need to frequently visit a specific Notion page for notes. Instead of searching for the page each time or scrolling through a long list of bookmarks, you can simply save it as '/notes'. Now, whenever you need to access the page, just type '/notes' into your browser's omnibox, and you're there in an instant!\n\nOr perhaps you're in the middle of a lengthy YouTube tutorial but need to pause and return later. No need to bookmark or save the link elsewhere. Just assign a shortcut like '/ytutorial', and you can easily return to the exact point you left off.\n\nThe same goes for your favorite news site (saved as '/news'), your most-used Google Doc (saved as '/doc'), or even a complex web app you're testing (saved as '/test'). The possibilities are endless!\n\nWhat's more, Slash Space Go! is not case-sensitive. Whether you type '/notes' or '/NOTES', you'll be directed to your desired website. And if you enter a shortcut that doesn't exist, you'll receive a notification, ensuring you're always in control.\n\nThe extension also helps manage your shortcuts. If you try to save a website that's already saved, you'll get a popup stating it's already linked. Similarly, repeating shortcut names is not allowed for clarity and ease of use. And don't worry about long, complicated shortcuts - there's a limit of 15 characters, keeping your shortcuts quick and easy to type.\n\nIn essence, Slash Space Go! is more than just a tool - it's a new way of browsing. It's about making the internet work for you, not the other way around. So why wait? Start your journey with Slash Space Go! today and experience the web like never before.\n\nUnfortuantely does not work on Vivaldi or ARC browser"
