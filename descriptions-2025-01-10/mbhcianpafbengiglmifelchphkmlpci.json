This approach, known as Syntax Highlighting, has been enhancing the readability of programming language texts with significant benefits for over three decades. Completely free to use, the coloring is effortlessly applied and activated instantly with the addition of the extension.  Add to Chrome now; the future of reading is in color. \n\nKey Features:\n---------------------\n1. Intelligent Emphasis: Our Syntax Highlighter intelligently de-emphasizes common functional words like prepositions and articles, so you can effortlessly skip them and focus on crucial content.\n\n2. Emphasis on Relevance: Proper nouns, symbols, and abbreviations are highlighted in a reddish color, making them stand out for quick recognition.\n\n3. Numbers in Blue: Easily identify numbers in a bluish hue, ensuring you never miss important numerical information.\n\n4. Verbs Anchored in Green: Verbs, the backbone of any sentence, are highlighted in a greenish color, drawing your attention to the key actions.\n\n5. Natural Nouns: Nouns retain their standard color (black for white backgrounds and white for dark backgrounds), maintaining readability while keeping the focus on critical elements.\n\n6. Block Highlighting: Blocks of text, such as quoted text and content within parentheses, are highlighted as units, helping you swiftly skim or concentrate on specific parts.\n\n7. Constant Improvements: We're committed to continuous improvement! Expect updates with new features based on the latest research and user feedback.\n\nAdd to Chrome now and see for yourself!\n\nWhy Read with Syntax Highlighting?\n---------------------------------------------------------\nStudies have demonstrated the remarkable benefits of syntax highlighting for programming languages, streamlining comprehension and improving productivity. See the Wikipedia page for Syntax Highlighting at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting. With Synhix, our innovative Chrome extension, we're extending these advantages to natural language reading. \n\nColor Taste is Personal\n-------------------------------------\nPersonalize Your Reading Experience with Synhix.\nWe understand that color preferences are as unique as you are. That's why color customization lies at the heart of our design. With Synhix, you're in control of how vibrant or subtle your reading experience is.\n\nSelect Your Theme: Choose from our diverse range of themes, from the detail-rich 'Liberal', which colors most elements, to the more restrained 'Moderate' and 'Conservative' options. For a minimalist approach, the 'Black and White' theme offers various shades of gray.\n\nExplore Color Biases: Fine-tune your experience with a 'color bias' setting â€“ a feature best explored firsthand to truly appreciate its impact.\n\nAdjust Contrast Levels: Cater to your visual comfort with five levels of contrast. From 'Very Soft' for a gentler view to 'Very Sharp' for striking clarity. The default 'Medium' setting offers a balanced view, but the choice is yours to make.\n\nAdd to Chrome now and dive into a reading experience that's tailored just for you.\n\nUnderstanding Synhix Permissions and Your Privacy\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike many browser extensions, Synhix requires permission to read and modify (by adding color information) the content of all websites you visit. However, Synhix is designed to respect your privacy: it does not make any other changes to the websites nor does it use the website text for any purpose other than enhancing your reading experience.\n\nAdd to Chrome now and try different color themes."
