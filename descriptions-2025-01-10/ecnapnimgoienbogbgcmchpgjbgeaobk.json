I wanted to call this \"Poncjs\", but I also didn't want it to be difficult to search for.\n\nIt is the spiritual successor to dotjs, which is no longer maintained.\n\nExtensions have security restrictions that stop them reading from the filesystem, so you'll also need to install the Punkjs Bridge App (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ecnapnimgoienbogbgcmchpgjbgeaobk).\n\n## How to Use\n\n* Install the extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dkjpmglejjkidbgnokkgkiablgbdabpk).\n* Install the app (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ecnapnimgoienbogbgcmchpgjbgeaobk).\n* Create your ~/.js directory.\n* Launch the app to configure the directory.\n* Hack on some js.\n\n## How it Works\n\nThe Punkjs extension and Punkjs Bridge app use the Chrome runtime messaging API for communicating.\n\nWhenever you navigate to a webpage the extension will tell the bridge what domain the page is on. The bridge will try to find matching files, starting with the TLD and working down through the levels. The extension then runs the returned Javascript in the context of the page.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Google Chrome."
