(primary, secondary and wheel)\n\nWith other input devices such as 5-button mouse or Apple's trackpad and magic mouse, navigating pages (Go back/forward) in the browser is seamless. This extension solves problem for easy navigation with a 3-button mouse.\n\nJust like swiping the trackpad to go back/forward, user can wheel-click then drag horizontally to go back/forward. (Drag to the right - Go Back a Page, Drag to the left - Go Forward a Page)\n\nUser has options to change the drag threshold length (in pixels). (e.g. if user wants dragging to be shorter, they can change settings in options page)\n\nThe source code for this extension can be found at https://github.com/j-shim/drag-to-go-back."
