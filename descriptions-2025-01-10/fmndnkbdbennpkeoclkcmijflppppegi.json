Well, do you? Do you really!?\n\nSee, these days we ‘like’ posts and videos because we want to seem socially active online. We can’t possibly watch everything out there so a lot of ‘likes’ are based on the popularity of a piece of content.\n\nWhether we want to admit it or not, our eyes always flick to the bottom corners of a post and, inevitably and subliminally, our opinion is influenced. If it's got a million views we're more likely to to 'like' it than if it had a dozen. This extension is an experiment in bringing integrity back into ‘liking’ something.\n\nActivate the plug-in and the number of ‘likes’ and views will disappear from content on YouTube and Facebook letting you ‘like’ things on their own merit.  \n\nyouLike? is still in alpha stage. Please tell us about any other sites you'd like to see supported and let us know if you experience any bugs."
