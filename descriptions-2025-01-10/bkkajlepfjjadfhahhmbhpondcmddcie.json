We need to access your search history by an affirmative opt-in first before we are able to provide the functionality.\n\nOnce the auto-clean mode is switched ON, our tool will automatically remove all the terms you browsed. When it’s switched OFF, you can manually do the job by reviewing the list of items you browsed and remove whichever item you want to.\n\nPlease note that the extension can only display the keywords you looked for after you have installed it. If you installed this extension to your browser, granted the access, but don’t see any keywords in the list on the UI, please don’t worry, the extension is working fine!\n\nThis extension can only remove your browsed keywords from Yahoo.

Access to \"<all_urls>\". we require this permission to check the default search engine of the user.\n4. Access to “history” (optional). We require this permission if you want to use the functionality of this extension. \n5. Access to \"storage\".
