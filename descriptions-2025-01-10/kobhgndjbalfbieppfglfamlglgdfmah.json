Servers marked with a green check mark do not spoof their player count, servers marked with a red cross and the text \"SPOOFED\" do spoof or fake their player count. This extension is basically an anti-seeder; server owners are misusing the seeding plugins, filling servers with all these fake players to stimulate real players to join too, but instead they are killing the game. When a real player joins a server that was supposed to be almost full, it is very disappointing to see that the server is actually empty after sitting through many minutes of loading screens. You can clearly see which servers are empty when running this plugin, and you can clearly see the servers that are actually full of players too!"
