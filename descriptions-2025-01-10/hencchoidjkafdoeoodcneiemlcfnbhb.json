Download and this extension\n2. Run A Product Search On AliExpress\n3. Every Product That Offers ePacket Shipping Is Highlighted For Quick Discovery\n\nThat’s it! \n\nAnd unlike other extensions that may charge you for different search options… \n\n…This app is completely free to use from start to finish.\n\nIf you’re doing any kind of dropshipping through AliExpress, here’s why you should install it today:\n\n1. Find Products Right On The Search Page:\nAliExpress doesn't show you the shipping methods available on the search results page so in order to find out what the product offers and how much it costs, you typically have to click through into each product and then click again on the shipping methods to see if ePacket is offered. Now, the products that offer ePacket Shipping are highlighted right on the search page with no extra clicks saving tons of time from clicking back and forth!\n\n2. Pricing On Search Page:\nNot all Shipping is equal. In fact, some vendors mark it up quite a bit so you won't notice. Now you can compare every product on a search page side by side. You'll have all the information in one easy view to make better choices about what vendor to use.\n\n3. Availability Per Country:\nePacket is offered in more countries than just the US. Just select the countries that you are interested in and we'll show you whether this shipping method is available in that country or not.  \n\n4. Filter Out Products\nIf you are not interested in products that don't offer ePacket, select the option to hide those products so you can focus on the products that work for you.\n\nAbout this app:\nThis is a project from the team at Dropified. If you haven’t heard of Dropified, it is a platform packed with tools and features to run and automate an eCommerce business. Many of its features are focused on automating AliExpress so it is a perfect fit for anyone looking to save time and put their eCommerce business on autopilot."
