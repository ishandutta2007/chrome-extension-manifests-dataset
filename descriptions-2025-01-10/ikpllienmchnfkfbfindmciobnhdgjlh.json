What makes it unique is the fact that the meeting tab does not have to be focused for you to be able to use push to talk (hence global).\n\nTo achieve it's global nature, Talkey consists of two components, a browser component, which is this extension, and a platform component, which is a desktop app, so be sure to download it. More information and usage guide can be found at the website (GitHub repository).\n\nTalkey is open-source so you are welcome to suggest features, report bugs and improve the software by submitting your own code."
