Enjoy a new convenient interface with the same speed and security!\n\nFOR DAPPS\nEVER Wallet injects the RPC API object into every website’s DOM context so that the distributed applications can read from the blockchain and interact with smart contracts. Be it a decentralized exchange, browser game, cross-chain bridge, or multi-signature wallet, EVER Wallet will serve you as a lightweight, configurable, and reliable Everscale client.\n\nPRIVACY AND PERMISSIONS\nThe extension does not and will not collect any data from you, so we will be grateful if you provide us your feedback in the Chrome store, on our Github page, Telegram chat, or send us an e-mail. See the “Useful links” section below.\nHowever, it will require your permission to read and write to any webpage, as it enhances the functionality of the normal browser context. You can always view the source code of EVER Wallet on Github.\n\nUSEFUL LINKS\nEverscale site: https://everscale.network\nSupport chat in Telegram: https://t.me/EVERWallet"
