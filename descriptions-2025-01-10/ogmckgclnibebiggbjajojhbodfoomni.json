Place the words you don't want to read in your own replacement list and, if you like, add a replacement text (or don't!), and enjoy your web navigation without those pesky words. You can even create replacement sets on Google Spreadsheet and maintain them from there. Replacements are private and personal only, but you can share the same sets with your friends. \nKudos to Douglas Adams for the name. Version 1.1 extracts key from full Google Spreadsheet's URIs, prevents from working on Google searches, and fixes some typos"
