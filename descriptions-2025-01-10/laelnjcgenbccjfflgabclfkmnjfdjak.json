This extension provides that context, in the form of an info bar on the side of a cashtag's search page. \n\nðŸ¤” No need to memorize ticker symbols, we look up the company name for every cashtag\nðŸ“ˆ 5 day share price chart\nðŸŒ“ Supports light, dim, and lights out modes on Twitter!\n\nOnce you've downloaded the extension, grab a free API key from alphavantage.co, and follow the instructions to enter that key into the extension's popup window. \n\nThen head to Twitter and click on any cashtag to start seeing results!\n\nNote: The free API tier from AlphaVantage only allows for 5 queries per minute, and 500 per day. If you run into errors where certain data won't display, it's because of these limits. Just wait a minute to try again, or you can personally upgrade to a paid API key with higher query limits.\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: This Chrome extension has no affiliations with Twitter Inc.
