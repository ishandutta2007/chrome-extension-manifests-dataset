Gopher is the predecessor of the World Wide Web and HTTP, so Gopher sites look very \"dated\" to today's users. However, Gopher provides a much simpler, cleaner browsing experience, and many former Gopher users fondly remember the Gopher web.\n\nThere is still a community of Gopher enthusiasts who continue to run servers and sites, but it can be hard to access these in standard browsers. Google Chrome, for instance, does not offer a native Gopher client. Burrow attempts to make Gopher access and navigation possible for Chrome users.\n\nCurrently this extension rewrites all gopher:// links to point to Floodgap's Public Gopher Proxy. It relies on Javascript to accomplish this, so make sure that Javascript is enabled!\n\nBurrow is an open source project published under the MIT license. Source code is available at https://gitlab.com/burrow-project/burrow-chrome-extension.\n\nv0.5 (8/24/22): Fix issue where new installation screen pops up on browser update"
