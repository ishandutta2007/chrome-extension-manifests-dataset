Reading time is calculated based on a reading speed of 200 words per minute.\n\n\nUpdate 13 Nov 2018:\n\n    1. Removed permission for reading clipboard. Planned feature has been cancelled, so don't need this permission anymore.\n    2. Made word count non-selectable, so it doesn't get included when doing select all (Ctrl/Cmd + A) on a webpage.\n\n-------\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://c306.net/apps/privacy/word-counter/"
