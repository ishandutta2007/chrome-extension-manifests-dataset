Tab Defenders is a memory manager for Chrome that automatically shuts down inactive tabs and frees up precious memory so that your system remains speedy and responsive!\n\nTab Defender has two different modes of operation:\n\nMODE 1: CLOSE TABS AFTER SPECIFIED DURATION\nYou can specify a duration (in minutes) after which any background tab (i.e. a tab that hasn't been visted) will be shut down and its URL saved to storage. This mode is great if you wish to periodically clean Chrome tabs while ensuring that they are always available for recovery if needed.\n\nMODE 2: CLOSE TABS USING LEARNT PATTERNS\nThe second mode of operation automatically learns your usage behaviors and shuts down tabs when it thinks that the chance of you returning to them is negligible. Tab Defender uses a state of the art statistical modelling module to track your domain-wise habits and automatically clean tabs in the background.\n\nRECOVERING CLOSED TABS\nIf a tab was accidently closed by the extension and you wish to recover it, use the 'View Complete History' option under the 'History' tab to see closed tabs and recover them with the click of a button.\n\nWHITELISTING DOMAINS\nIf there are some domains whose tabs you do not want to be automatically closed, you can add them to the whitelist directly from the extension.\n\nTHEMES\nThe extension offers a modern UI theme (default) as well as a more retro look. You can switch between the two by clicking the 'Tab Defenders' button in the extension popup. Please close and re-open the popup to see your changes in action.\n\nAbout the Developers\nThis extension was developed by Aman Ladia, Jean Laguerre, Anthony Mensah, William Lam and Hung Bui of Stanford University."
