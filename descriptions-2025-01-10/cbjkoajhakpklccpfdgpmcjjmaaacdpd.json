The file contains one URL per line. It is further possible to open all URLs from a given file in new browser tabs.\n\nAttention: This extension saves URLs to a file on your local machine in plain text. While it is bad practice to include sensitive data in URLs, this is still not uncommon. Be aware that this sensitive data may be accessible to other users. Therefore, it is recommended to use this extension only in browsers that are solely used for security analysis or development purposes.\n\nThis extension does not send any data to any third party. However, it is possible that the extension itself contains vulnerabilities. There is automatic static code analysis in place to detect such vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the source code before using this extension."
