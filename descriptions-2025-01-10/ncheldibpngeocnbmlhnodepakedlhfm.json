Once completed, add an account to your personal account. Now, go to Hapara Workspace and sign-in through your school account. Hapara currently has a glitch, where you might have to sign-in multiple times.\n\nThis should solve the problem and as a bonus, teachers can't see your screen since you are still in your personal account. :)"
