This research made it evident to me that some sort of a tool was needed to remind people that what they say online can affect others. The links to such research are in the link below, if you are interested in reading more. I wanted the tool to be purely informational and advisory without restricting the user from posting what they want to. Therefore, I created a plugin that highlights offensive text being used by showing toast notifications specific to the type of language used to remind the user that the language they are using can be deemed as offensive to others and could be hurtful. This plugin works on Reddit, Tumblr, and Facebook. It is available for download on Google Chrome and Firefox. Link to research sources: https://gitlab.com/Mary-Phelan/browser-exstension"
