Have you ever had a file on Google Drive shared with you, but gotten an error because it was shared with your secondary account? Some of those services have an icon in the top right-hand corner to switch your account, but some of them don't. This extension helps with those services that don't.\n\nNever again settle for the advice of \"log out of all your Google accounts and log back in with just this one.\" If you're like me, you've been there, and are in no rush to get back.\n\nThe permissions are limited and reasonable. It should not significantly affect performance. All the code is short, readable, commented, and completely open source (https://github.com/agoldstein03/Account-Chooser-Extension)."
