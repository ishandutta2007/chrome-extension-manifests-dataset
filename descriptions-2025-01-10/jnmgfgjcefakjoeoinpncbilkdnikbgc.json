The functions are: Group and Clean.\n1. Group\nUsers can easily create, search, and close groups. They can focus on a specific task within a group, allowing them to stay organized and efficient.\nUsers can summon a pop-up window on any page by using the default shortcut key cmd + shift + O.\n* Pressing \"Enter\" selects a group. \n* \"Cmd + Enter\" closes a group. \n* When searching for a keyword that doesn't match any existing groups, pressing \"Enter\" creates a new group. (If you want to specify a color when creating a group, you can use \"[[\" to separate the color keyword. Currently supported colors include \"grey\", \"blue\", \"red\", \"yellow\", \"green\", \"pink\", \"purple\", \"cyan\", and \"orange\". For example, \"demo[[red\" creates a group named \"demo\" with the color red. )\n* In the omnibox, you can also use the keyword \"tp\" to trigger the group creation. \n* When focused on a group, any new tabs created will automatically belong to that group.\n2. Clean\n* It allows you to search and filter tabs by keywords in titles or URLs, and easily close or pin tabs.\n* After retrieval is complete, press Enter to call up the operation box, which supports closing and pinning. You can also click the button on the right side of the input box."
