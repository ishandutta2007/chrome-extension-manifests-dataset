Inspired by sleepyti.me, Slumber suggests times to go to bed so you feel rested and energized in the morning. \n\nSimply set your wake up time and find out when to fall asleep.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nSleep cycles consist of periods of deep sleep and REM sleep, together they last about 90 minutes. Slumber calculates sleep times by counting backwards in sleep cycles based on the time you have to wake up. Falling asleep at one of the suggested times will ensure that you wake up in between your sleep cycle!\n\nSLEEP WELL, FEEL GREAT\nWaking up in between sleep cycles allows for your mind and body to feel more refreshed in the morning, which will improve your energy, mood, and mental sharpness.\n\nSlumber is a simple extension intended to help make waking up just a little less terrible."
