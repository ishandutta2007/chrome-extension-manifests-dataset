In this game, you take control of a small piece of paper and navigate it through a virtual world. The objective is to expand your territory by claiming as much space as possible. You can do this by moving your paper character around and leaving a trail behind. Be careful, though, as other players will try to cross your trail and eliminate you. To protect yourself, you can attack and eliminate your opponents by crossing their trails. The more territory you conquer, the higher your score will be. With its simple yet engaging gameplay, Paper.io 2 promises hours of fun and fierce competition. You can also play this game for free on the website https://classroom-6x.org/. So, gather your friends and start dominating the paper world!\n\n\n*Note: We have added \"Classroom 6x, Poki Unblocked\" button, making it easy for players to quickly access the games on our website https://classroom-6x.org, https://poki.ee"
