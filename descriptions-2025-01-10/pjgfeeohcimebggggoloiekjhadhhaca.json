The extension delivers AI-powered ambient noise reduction and echo cancellation to both customers and agents for a clear, crisp and focused conversation when enabled across CXone Agent via the feature toggle in tenant management. Voices are instantly isolated and all background noise is removed in real-time from both sides of the call from start to finish.\n\n\nWhen the CXone Agent Noise Cancellation extension is installed and enabled and the Noise Cancellation feature toggle across CXone Agent in Tenant Management is enabled and the Noise Cancellation slider will display in CXone Agent. The agent can then adjust the sensitivity using the displayed sliders for eliminating the background noise from the agent and patron side. It is set to 90 for the mic slider (agent side) and 70 for the speaker slider (patron side) by default.\n\n\nIn the event that CXone Agent is refreshed or unexpectedly closed, the active audio path between the agent and patron will not be disrupted."
