It is not meant to make the decision for you, it is just a quick assessment.\n\nHere is some of the criteria we look for.\nIt is **important** to note that missing some of these is not a huge problem. They add up in total to more than 100% of a possible score. So, one missing can still allow a perfect grade.\n\n- Has License file or section in the README. It is an immediate fail if no license is found.\n\n- Stars count being above 100.\n- Has Readme file.\n- Most recent commit. Scaled to within a year. 1 year ago being a 0 and now being a 20.\n- Amount of contributors being greater than 5.\n- Amount of commits.\n- Has a sponsors section.\n- Has a releases section\n- Has docs folder.\n- Frequency of commits for root level files and folders. Checks amount of time between most recent and oldest. Also checks for varied dates between and ratio of unique commits.\n- Open issues relative to star count or commit count, whichever is greater.\n\nYou can even configure which ones you want to have as part of your check list by clicking the cog icon. (changing exact weight values coming soon.)"
