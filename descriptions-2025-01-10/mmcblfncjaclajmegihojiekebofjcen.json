The last addition (in the current version 7.0) is the permission scanner. For the next versions we plan to add even more plugins management and security related features.\n\n🔑 This extension requires the following permissions:\n-- \"Context Menu\" -- needed to add the plugins links to the right-click menu\n-- \"Active Tab\" -- that is required for the \"Allow/Block on current site\" to work\n-- \"Management\" -- it needs that permission in order for the \"Plugins Manager\" and \"Permission Scanner\" to access extensions, apps and themes installed\n\n🔒 Privacy:\nWe do not collect any data and this extension does not communicate with any external servers. \n\n💲Paid Promotions:\nThis extension includes affiliate (promotional) links to third-party extension called: \"Guardio Protection for Chrome\". If you click on those links, we may get compensated."
