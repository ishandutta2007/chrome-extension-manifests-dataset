I wanted to enlarge the font-size of Chinese characters without changing the size of English text or any other elements on the page.\n\nHow does it work?\nThe current version of Hanzisize is able to selectively resize Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, English, Georgian, Korean, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, and Thai text. Other languages may be added later based on demand.\n\nHanzisize allows for easy increasing and decreasing font-size on the page, with a few limitations. For example, the font size of an element can never be smaller than it was when the page was first loaded. This prevents headers and other large font size elements from shrinking while small paragraph text is enlarged.\n\nPrivacy\nHanzisize does not collect or transmit any user data. The only information that is stored are the most recent language and font size settings for user convenience. This data is stored in the user's browser and is not transmitted externally or used for any other purpose.\n\nHi there. I'm Ryan, the sole developer of Hanzisize. I've spent hundreds of hours working on Hanzisize while making it available for anyone to use for free. If you are able, please consider donating so I can continue to improve this tool for all of us. If you're not able to donate, please leave a review of this extension so more people can find it.

The default hotkeys are:\n\n\"Shift+Alt+Q\" - Initiate resizing using the most recent language and fontsize settings\n\n\"Shift+Alt+W\" - Open the Hanzisize menu\n\nThese default hotkeys can be changed to the key combination of your choice in your browser settings."
