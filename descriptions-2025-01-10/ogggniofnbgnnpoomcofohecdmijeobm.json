Are they throwing the ticket number at you, hoping you can catch up? With this simple extension, you are always ready to receive a Freshdesk ticket number. Just click it, fill the ticket number in and hit the enter key. And there you go.\n\nThis extension uses no tracking or what so ever. It does never look at your tickets, it doesn't store what you are doing and what ticket numbers you are entering. It's not sending anything to any server. It just opens a new tab with the right URL."
