Therefore, this extension aids in centralizing all of your GeeksForGeeks solutions to GitHub in an organized manner.\n\nüìå Also, manually adding your GeeksForGeeks solutions to a GitHub repository is an extremely time-consuming and tedious procedure. Therefore, this extension automates the entire process without you needing to put-in any extra effort.\n\nüìå Centralizing your solutions means easy and fast access to all your solutions.\n\nüìå Having all your solutions in one place helps you to keep track of your progress.\n\n‚ú® Features :\n\n‚úÖ You can create a new repository / link an existing repository to this extension by simply entering the repository name during the onboarding process.\n\n‚úÖ The extension popup sports a dashboard that maintains difficulty-level-wise count of the problems you have solved on GeeksForGeeks.\n\n‚úÖ Each solution is pushed into a directory named as the difficulty level of that problem. So, the repository is extremely organized.\n\n‚úÖ A README.md file is created for each new problem solved. This README.md file contains the problem details as it appears on the GeeksForGeeks problem's page.\n\n‚úÖ This extension also supports multi-language submissions, which means that if you solve a problem in both Java and C++, a separate file will be created for both languages under the same directory.\n\n‚úÖ A solution file is committed to your GitHub repository only on successful submission on GeeksForGeeks.\n\n‚úÖ The extension popup also features a Dark Mode toggle, so you can choose a theme of your choice."
