This is a more feature-rich version of Simple Tab Sorter, designed to contain feature requests that might conflict with Simple Tab Sorter's design goals of remaining \"Simple\" and lightweight.\n\nIn addition to standard URL or title-based sorting, its \"killer features\" are:\n\n1. Respects Google Chrome's Tab Groups.\n2. \"Sort By URL\" sorts by domain, sub-sorts by host name.\n3. \"Sort By Custom\" is like \"Sort By URL\", with the ability to simply override the order of tabs manually - demonstrated in https://github.com/pwhite2/super-tab-sorter/blob/master/STS_Custom_Sort_Demo.mp4\n4. Optional dedupe while sorting.\n5. User configurable sort behavior for handling tabs suspended by extensions derived from The Great Suspender (please review the User Guide under Options for configuration instructions).\n\nIf you encounter any issues, or have ideas for improvements, submissions at https://github.com/pwhite2/super-tab-sorter/issues and pull requests are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\nPeter\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE INSTALLING AND SUBMITTING NEGATIVE REVIEWS:\n\n1. Simple Tab Sorter v0.4.0 and later require Chrome version 88 or later. If you're using an older version of Chrome, you can manually install v0.3.3 by following the instructions at https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter#install-as-an-extension-from-source .\n\n2. \"Read your browsing history\" permission warning during install in versions 0.4.0 and later...\n\nChrome changed the permissions message for \"tabs\" permissions for manifest v3 extensions. The new release (0.4.0) isn't doing anything with the tabs API that it wasn't doing before - i.e., it doesn't have access to your browser history, just the currently open tab URLs which are required to sort by URL.\n\nYou can see the requested permissions for this extension at https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter/blob/master/src/manifest.json. The developer documentation for the \"tabs\" API (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs) states:\n\n\"The \"tabs\" permission\nThis permission does not give access to the chrome.tabs namespace. Instead, it grants an extension the ability to call tabs.query() against four sensitive properties on tabs.Tab instances: url, pendingUrl, title, and favIconUrl.\"\n\nAs you'll see, there is NO mention of \"history\" anywhere in the \"chrome.tabs\" developer documentation. To have access to your browsing history, an extension would have to specify \"history\" in the manifest.json permissions, which you can verify this doesn't, as documented at https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/history.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n2024-01-04: Version 0.5.2 released\n* Fixed sort all windows bug resulting from conversion to manifest v3\n\n2023-12-19: Version 0.5.1 released\n* Removed \"Test\" from Settings dialog and removed unused file.\n\n2023-12-18: Version 0.5.0 released\n* This is the initial release, forked from my work on Simple Tab Sorter 0.4.0 (to be released shortly after this)\n* Added \"Dedupe tabs (in current window)\" option and disabled it by default\n* Sort By URL sorts by root domain name and sub-sorts by host name"
