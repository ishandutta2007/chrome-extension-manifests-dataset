Its features are meant to be used while at the keyboard, and not meant for set and forget (AFK).\n\nThe extension adds functionality to the client such as scripts, command repeater, and some common event handling during combat and non-combat scripts. It comes with a collection of scripts you can use and reference when writing your own. Future releases will add more scripts and features!\n\nIt does not capture or send data over the wire whatsoever, the only thing it stores locally within Chrome is a copy of your scripts to save them between sessions.\n\nPlease do not rely on the extension to permanently store your scripts, as Chrome's local storage can be cleared in a number of scenarios. Be sure to back up your scripts.\n\nYou can find out more about the extension on its GitHub page: https://github.com/jdalley/tecext. It has instructions for installing the extension in Developer mode (unpackaged), if you want to play around with code changes yourself. Feel free to submit an issue if you'd like to see something fixed or added, or to check out the source code before you install it."
