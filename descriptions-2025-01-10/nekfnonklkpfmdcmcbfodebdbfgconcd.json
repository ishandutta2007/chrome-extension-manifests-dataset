Look to the top of your browser window and count how many tabs you have open right now. Is it a lot? In a recent poll I conducted on the highly respected opinion platform known as The Twitter, 60% of respondents had more than 15 tabs open at voting time.\n\nIf that describes your browser window and you're anything like me, a few of those open tabs are staples -- your email and perhaps one or two other essential tools. Maybe even a news publisher or social media site. The rest are likely pages that fall into a category I like to describe as \"too important to close but not important enough to bookmark\".\n\nThe problem is bookmarking tools are just too high friction for your average bookmarking use-case. Few of us are trying to build vast curated personal libraries of web sites (any longer!). Yet this is the assumption they seem built around. We don't need no stinkin' folksonomy! Instead, we just want a simple means to stash away something noteworthy for future reference or deferred digestion.\n\nIt should be very easy (although largely unecessary) to delete them. They should be instantly searchable. And they should never ever live in a drop-down menu!\n\nUrly Solo is a Chrome extension (obviously) that uses synchronised storage to work across all your desktop Chrome instances. This does constrain Urly to a maximum data store of 512 bookmarks - so after installation there are a couple of policies you can choose from to manage this.\n\nYou can use keyboard shortcuts or a menu from the browser toolbar to quickly save and close a tab, which is why our icon is a fancy \"x\". Think of it as an alternative to the standard tab-closing \"x\".\n\nAdd this extension and free yourself from the tyranny of tab clutter!"
