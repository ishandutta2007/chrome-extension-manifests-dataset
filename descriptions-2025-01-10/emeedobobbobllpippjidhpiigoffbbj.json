If you are looking for a new password manager, you may want to consider other, more convenient, alternatives.\n\n-----\n\n--- Troubleshooting ---\nAs long as you remember the master password, you can recover all the other passwords, even without the extension. The algorithm is published on our website, and you can use it with any md5 generator.\nUnfortunately, if you forget the master password, you won't be able to recover it in any way, nor any of the generated passwords, so make sure you remember it and perhaps note it down somewhere so that you won't forget it.\n\n--- Permissions ---\nRead your browsing history:\n  More accurately, this is used to get the URL of the website you are currently viewing.\nModify data you copy and paste.\n  This is needed for copying the generated password (when you click it).\n\n--- Website ---\nairdevs.com"
