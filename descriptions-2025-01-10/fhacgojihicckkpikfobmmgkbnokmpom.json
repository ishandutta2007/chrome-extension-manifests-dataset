If you are outside of Croatia it is unlikely that this will be of much use to you.\n\n## How to use\nInstall the extension and right Click on any selected text for which you would like to check if OIBs is valid or not. Menu item \"Check if OIB is OK...\" will be shown and upon clicking it, you will be shown message containing if those number are Mathematically correct OIB or not.\n\n## How does it work\nOIBs are created by first generating 10 digits and then calculating the final, 11th, control digit that is used to validate the OIB. The last digit is generated from first 10 digit using the ISO7064 (MOD 11,10) specification.\n\nThis extension just checks if OIBs are Mathematically correct or not. If OIB are valid this does not mean that it is used by the citizens or companies in Croatia.\n\n## Privacy\nAll calculation is done locally (on the client) and none of personal information is shared via internet"
