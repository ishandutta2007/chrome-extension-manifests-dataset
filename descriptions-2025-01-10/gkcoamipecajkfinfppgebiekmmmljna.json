The purpose of this extension is to help prevent scams by ascertaining who owns a particular smart contract. It works with Etherscan so that when you view a contract on Etherscan.io, you will see a checkmark if the contract ownership is verified. Otherwise, you will either see a question mark (?) if the owner is unknown, or an X mark if the contract ownership has been revoked."
