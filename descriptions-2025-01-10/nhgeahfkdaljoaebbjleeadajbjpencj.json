Can't be very good then.\" This mindset hinders the discovery of interesting new content.\n\nIntroducing ViewNew, a Chrome extension that automatically randomizes all YouTube views and like counts. No longer will you be a slave to popular opinion. Each video on the page is assigned a random view count between 100 million and 1 billion. The like counts are randomized as well. Freely click on the videos you think are interesting without having to compare and contrast popularity.\n\nYou'll know you're being lied to, but at least YouTube will be more fun."
