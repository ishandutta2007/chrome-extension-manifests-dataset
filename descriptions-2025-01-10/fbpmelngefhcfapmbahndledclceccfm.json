There are several unit converters available in Google extension now. However, none of them focus on the application in the civil/environmental field. \n\nFor instance, I often need to convert flow rate from gpm to m3/second when I worked at a consulting firm as senior engineer. The hydraulic loading rate is also frequently calculated for reactor design, changing unit from gpm/ft2 to ft/second.\n\nCompared to version 0001, the version 0002 fixed a bug in conversion of temperature. It also created a better user interface than the first version."
