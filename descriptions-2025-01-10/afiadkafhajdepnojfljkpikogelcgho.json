However, we do respect important meetings and have implemented a system to delay a meme by up to an hour because a meeting longer than that isn't worth going to without memes! The autoscroll feature automatically scrolls memes for you after every 20 seconds. There is even a 'Next' button with which you can manually scroll or skip a meme. The memes are sourced from 60+ subreddits across Reddit and are filtered to exclude any Not Safe For Work (NSFW) posts. We can't wait to see you get lost in a never ending world of instant gratification!\n\nHow to use?\n- Add the extension to Google Chrome.\n- Click on the extension icon.\n- Set the timer using the slider.\n- Once set, click 'Done'.\n- Get back to work, a new chrome window will pop-up in the selected time with memes!"
