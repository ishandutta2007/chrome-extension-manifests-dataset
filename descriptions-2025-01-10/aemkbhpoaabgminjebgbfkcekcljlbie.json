It's Apple news without the sharp bits... unless you want that, just click the permalinks & headlines to read the full unedited story.\n\nRead the best tech news curation on the net without feeling grumpy about the world each morning.  Keep the site insightful, just make it Not Negative.  Enjoy!\n\nNew in version 1.0.1\n* Adds compatibility with the \"Daring Fireball With Comments\" & \"Comic Fireball\" extensions\n* Now filters linkblog pages, but leaves permalink pages intact\n* Filters out more James Bond stories\n\nNew in version 1.0.2 - 1.0.7\n* More improvements to keyword filtering\n* Improved detection of James Bond stories.\n* Filtering of more non-tech stories.\n* Better filtering of Kubrick stories.\n\nNew in version 1.0.8 - 1.1.0\n* Huge update!  Added an options page to choose what you want to show/hide.\n* Added \"The Reckoning\": option to hide ads on Daring Fireball!  (Off by default.)\n* Selectively show or hide stories about Sports, James Bond, Kubrick, Politics & Snark.\n* Hide quotes from other websites & see how little original DF content there is.\n* Also works on the https version of DF. Not sure why I didn't think of this before.\n* Now filters out stories about Trump and the White House.\n\nNew in version 1.1.1\n* We missed some Bond / Spectre stories. Fixed now!"
