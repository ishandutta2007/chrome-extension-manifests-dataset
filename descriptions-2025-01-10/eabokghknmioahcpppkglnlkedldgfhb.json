You can specify urls or parts of them to match visited sites. If a match is found your time limit begins to deplete. When the time is used up, the blacklisted sites are blocked. You can also whitelist sites to not deplete the time. For example you can block the whole domain reddit.com, but allow www.reddit.com/r/programming/. \n\nYou can whitelist or blacklist specific YouTube channels or genres.\n\nYou can set different rules for different times of the day, different days of the week or anything you can come up with using multiple independent block sets. You can have up to 50 of them.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nPatch notes:\n\nVersion 1.5.2\n- Save indicator made sticky to always be on screen\n- Small visual improvements\n\nVersion 1.5.1\n- Fix inability to add more than 15 block sets in options.\n- Switch to overall more usable whole page options menu\n\nVersion 1.5.0\n- Added compression for saves to allow more blocking rules for each block set \n   (from ~80 rules to 500 and more depending on shortness of the rules)\n- Improved save indicator \n   * Message shown is clearer than before when settings are successfully saved\n   * Now shows a message if there was an error when saving, eg. storage is full\n- Fixed timer not resetting in some situations\n- Improved annoy mode banner consistency on different websites\n- Added hover tooltip to show full contents of long blocking rules\n\nVersion 1.4.7\n- Fixed bug where deleting drag and dropped block sets would break the settings user interface until reload\n- Annoy mode banner made more consistent on different websites\n\nVersion 1.4.6\n- Fixed colors in typing test to be visible in dark mode\n\nVersion 1.4.5\n- Fixed bug where \"Require active\" setting could not be unchecked\n\nVersion 1.4.4\n- Fixed bug where youtube playlists would get blocked unintentionally\n\nVersion 1.4.3\n- Numbers in number input now distinguishable from the background in dark mode\n- Fixed bug where first blacklist/whitelist rule was always deleted regardless of button pressed\n- Fixed typos\n\nVersion 1.4.1\n- Fixed old help message\n\nVersion 1.4.0\n- Implemented settings protection system, which allows you to edit settings when timers are zero\n\nVersion 1.3.1\n- Fixed bug that caused the wrong blacklist rules to be removed when the amount of rules exceeded 10\n\nVersion 1.3.0\n- Removed unintended regex matching (eg. characters \"?\", \"*\", \"+\", and \"=\" didn't work correctly)\n- Added intentional regex matching\n- Added ability to choose if unfocused tabs deplete time\n- Small tweaks\n\nVersion 1.2.1\n- Active dates now applied more reliably\n\nVersion 1.2.0\n- Now uses a much more reliable alarms api for resetting timers\n- UI improvements on Firefox\n- Cursor now clearly shows when an option is disabled\n\nVersion 1.1.6\n- Fixed a bug where users could not add YouTube channels from the options page\n\nVersion 1.1.4\n- Sorted out library links to satisfy Mozilla's security policies\n\nVersion 1.1.3\n- Fixed a bug where timer would reset every time when opening the browser\n\nVersion 1.1.2\n- Popup buttons are now not disabled when annoy mode is on (same behaviour as options page)\n\nVersion 1.1.1\n- Annoy mode banner font more reliably pretty\n- Firefox specific css optimization\n\nVersion 1.1.0\n- Annoy mode\n   * shows overtime in a banner instead of blocking\n   * less intrusive way to discourage website usage\n- Dark theme\n- Slight visual update\n- Small stuff\n   * periodic saving made more bandwith efficient\n   * corrected typos\n   * fixed issue, where in rare cases time elapsed at double rate"
