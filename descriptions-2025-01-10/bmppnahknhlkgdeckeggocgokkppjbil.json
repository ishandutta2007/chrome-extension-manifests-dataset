These reduced-quality versions are made public, while the original high-quality versions are made unlisted (unsearchable). For each video, publishers set a list of eligibilities that give people access to the high-quality version. An eligibility may be a subscription to a music streaming service, possession of an iTunes track associated with the video, or a code distributed with physical media or at events. The aim is to give people an incentive to buy music.\n\nThe descriptions of reduced-quality videos have a link to a page where an eligibility can be verified. Once verified, the user is given access to the high-quality version by having it added to a playlist in their YouTube channel.\n\nThis extension makes it easier to access your high-quality video entitlements:\n\n1. Links to the public reduced-quality versions in YouTube search results are replaced with links to the high-quality versions, so a normal click-through will bring up the high-quality version.\n\n2. An \"RQ\" link is added to high-quality video-view pages, and a \"HQ\" link is added to reduced-quality video-view pages, making it easy to switch between them to see comments, etc.\n\n3. Links to the reduced-quality versions around the Web are replaced with links to the high-quality versions.\n\n4. Embeds of reduced-quality versions around the Web have an \"HQ\" link superimposed (the HQ versions may not be embeddable)."
