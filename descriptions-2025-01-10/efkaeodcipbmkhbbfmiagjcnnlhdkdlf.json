It also shows the currently available items in the store and makes them easily searchable.\nBased on this data automatic calculation of optimal CCU chains to create ships with the most savings for you is provided.\n\nThe extension helps to get the data from robertsspaceindustries.com which is otherwise not accessible to ccugame.app. The extension only runs in your browser and doesn't send any data to another server. You need to be logged in on robertsspaceindustries.com, you don't need to login in the extension itself, so your credentials stay secure.\nPurely optionally, you can sync your data through the cloud with the https://ccugame.app website (e.g. to access the data from your mobile device).\n\nThe video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFug1OKWJs by Karolinger gives a good overview of the tool.\n\n--\n\nThis is a hobby project (free of charge).\n\nWhile I try to do everything to the best of my knowledge and belief, this software comes without any warranty whatsoever and I assume no liability for any problems or damages which might occur due to its use."
