It is meant to be run alongside the desktop app to allow easier bookmarking.\n\nTurtl is open-source, allowing anybody to audit the source or run their own version: https://github.com/turtl\n\n***\n\nWe believe you should have control over who has access to your data. This is a real problem: with increasing threats from hackers and government surveillance, how can you trust the online services that store your private information? The idea behind Turtl is that you shouldn't have to.\n\nWe've set up our service so that only you have the keys to your data and it gets encrypted before it leaves your computer. That way, even if the NSA wiretaps your Internet connection, even if an army of mercenaries storms our data-center and steals our hard drives, your data is unreadable to everyone, including us.\n\nBecause it's nobody else's business but yours."
