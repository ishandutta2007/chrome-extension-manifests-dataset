Have you ever been tired of people writing things just to p*ss you off? You don't have to waste your time seeing posts you don't want to read.\n\nOnce you feed extension with troll names while visiting a forum/webpage all posts written by trolls are hidden. Simple as that. No more rubbish. Of course, you can see the post if you really want - each hidden post has an 'eye' icon to show/hide the post.\n\nChangelog:\n0.1.1 to 0.1.4:\n* Move 'show post' icon (eye) next to username. Make this place configurable via pages scripts.\n* Remove unnecessary files (tagify source code) from build\n* Remove unnecessary permissions. Matches for content_scripts automatically requests access to listed sites\n* add support for optyczne.pl"
