Send your feedback to mschedulerteam@gmail.com\n\nNOTE 1: Schedule Builder is subject to change (especially during new semesters) and could affect the functionality of MScheduler. If a feature is no longer working as expected, please email us @ mschedulerteam@gmail.com and we'll get right on it!\n\nNOTE 2: MScheduler is an independent extension and is not affiliated with College Scheduler or the University of Michigan. It was created and maintained by current University of Michigan students."
