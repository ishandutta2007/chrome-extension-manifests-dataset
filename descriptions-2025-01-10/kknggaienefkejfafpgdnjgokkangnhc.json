There is no better way to remember to complete your habits than seeing them on every new page you open! This extension has helped me master the art of showing up, and I hope it can do the same for you.\n\n-Each habit is a movable bubble timer, that resets each day. \n-You can adjust the size, color, position and duration of each habit to your liking. \n-Lots of sea themed backgrounds that change on every page, and it automatically adjusts for dark mode according to your system settings. \n-Upon completion of all your habits, you'll be greeted by a lovely fireworks show for that needed dopamine boost. \n-100% free.\n-Open source on Github.\n-Completely private, no data ever leaves your device. Also completely offline.\n\nMore updates are on the way, and please let me know what you would like to see in future updates, I'll try my best to implement them!\n\nThank you for considering it, and best of luck with your daily habits!!"
