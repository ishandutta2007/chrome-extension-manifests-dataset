The plugin can remember and securely store passwords used on websites. The security of passwords is ensured by the chosen master password. Passwords are stored locally on the user's computer in a well-defined file, but access to the file's data requires the master password. However, the file containing passwords can be transferred between different computers. One license is associated with one email address, so passwords associated with the same email address can be accessed from an unlimited number of computers. This is at the user's discretion. It is important to note that the master password should be a truly secure password! Please read the user manual!"
