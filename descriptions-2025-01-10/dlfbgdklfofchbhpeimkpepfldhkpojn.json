This way, you will be able to easily jump back and forth between different calendar sets.\n\nUseful for viewing an entire team's availability, or previewing several conference rooms' load all at once.\n\nEasily showing or hiding all calendars is also supported.\n\nHint: Consider combining this with the Event Merge for Google Calendar extension for cleaner visuals: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/event-merge-for-google-ca/idehaflielbgpaokehlhidbjlehlfcep\n\nIssues and Limitations\nFeel free to reach out to us in case you encounter any issues. Current known limitations are:\n-  Only one Google account per browser profile is supported. If you need to use several Google accounts, you can use several Chrome profiles for this: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\n- Very large (ca. 50+) numbers of calendars cause issues, especially on slower machines\n\nDisclaimer\nNo representations are made about the suitability of this software for any purpose. It is provided “as is” without express or implied warranty.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nWhen you use this extension, your presets (including the names of your calendars) are stored in your browser’s local storage. They synchronise across your signed-in devices using Google Chrome’s cloud-based mechanism — in case you have enabled it. Your presets are not shared with anyone else and no further private data is uploaded to any servers. Only anonymous usage data (such as the event of opening the extension) is collected, using Google Analytics. You can opt out of this at any time by going to the extension’s options and unselecting the respective checkbox.\n\nHomepage\nHosted at https://orestta.github.io/MultipleCalendarsSelector/\n\nCredits\nIcon by https://www.flaticon.com/authors/vectors-market\n\nAuthor\nMade by Orest Tarasiuk & Igor Tarasiuk at Dessert Ventures: https://dessertventures.com?ref=MCS",
