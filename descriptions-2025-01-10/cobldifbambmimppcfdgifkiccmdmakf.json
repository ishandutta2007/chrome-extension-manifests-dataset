It offers a flexible policy that does not strictly forbid any content, but instead gives YOU the power over your browsing choices. You can still visit distracting websites after completing a small challenge, and if you really take the effort to do so, you are getting notified by the extension in a regular interval until all of the distracting content gets closed. Pleasant design, productivity quotes, or ability to specify your upcoming task are just a few of the convenience features you will have access to. Everything is for free and highly customizable.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nRelease Notes\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.0.1 - press 'TAB' to browse settings - hint removed\n1.0.0 - initial release"
