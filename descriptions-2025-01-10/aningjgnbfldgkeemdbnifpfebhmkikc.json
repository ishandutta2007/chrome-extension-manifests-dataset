My LinkedIn, my GitHub, my portfolio, along with some other basic information. So to combat that and to speed up the submitting the application process, I quickly built Jobsnag.\n\nOpen Sourced\nJobsnag is open source, so you can look at everything from how the logic works to how the data is being stored, etc. (using Chrome's API so nothing that you add here goes to any database or anything)."
