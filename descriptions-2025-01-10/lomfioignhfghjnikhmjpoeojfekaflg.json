Also, there is no set time limit on how long the mail is good for. This means that the mail will be deleted after a certain amount of time.\n\nUsers usually use temporary emails so that they don't have to sign up for a lot of email lists. It helps users avoid getting emails that they didn't ask for.\n\nHow do I get an Edu mail account?\n\nOnce you get to the change area, you will start getting email and university mail. If you have an Edu email address, it will be easier for you to sign up for free accounts on many premium sites.\n\nAbout Temporary mail\n\nThe word \"temp mail\" is made up of the words \"temporary\" and \"email.\" We use temporary mail to sign up for social media, websites, blogs, and many other online services. Temp mail is a useful tool that will help you get an email address without having to sign up for that website.\n\nTo join any website, you will need to give an email address. You need an email address to play online games, apply for anything, or sign up for a website. We'll be able to use those websites because of this. \n\nYou will find it easier to get in if you have a temporary email address. If you have a lot of unwanted emails that need to be deleted, you could use temp mail to get rid of them since it won't bother users to delete emails from storage. If you are worried about this, you can get rid of them by sending them temporary mail."
