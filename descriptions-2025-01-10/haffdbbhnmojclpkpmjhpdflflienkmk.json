Tabminder helps make you more mindful of browsing distracting sites by providing a gentle reminder every few minutes, preventing quick visits to Reddit, Twitter, and Hacker News from turning into work-sucking time vortexes. \n\nWhen you open a distracting tab, Tabminder starts counting down from your preset time limit. When time's up, it  prompts you to close the distracting tab or restart the timer. It's just annoying enough to keep you aware of distracted browsing, but not so strict that it prevents you from taking a break once in a while.\n\nTabminder 1.0 is a significant update including a new Chrome-style UI, test coverage for better reliability, bult-in help, and an improved background script behind the scenes.\n\nChanges in version 1.0:\n• Improved UI using native Chrome widgets.\n• Built-in help page.\n• Removed content script and refactored timer.\n• Background script and settings page test coverage."
