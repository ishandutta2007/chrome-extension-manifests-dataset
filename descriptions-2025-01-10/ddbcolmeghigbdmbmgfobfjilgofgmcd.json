When those students are in a walled-garden at school and the school/district cannot manage Khan Academy, this extension will help maintain student privacy and prevent unmoderated chatting. Google admins wanting to use this in their domains should force install this extension on student Google accounts with Developer Tools disabled otherwise they could use the Inspect Tool."
