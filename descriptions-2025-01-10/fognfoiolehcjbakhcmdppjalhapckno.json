In the above images you can see a Tweet from Elon Musk one shows the revenue that tweet could potentially make another shows twitters view count\n\nThis Google Chrome Extension changes the views button on a tweet to show the estimated revenue the user made from that specific tweet. According to Twitter( X? nobody really calls it that lets be honest), A user needs to pass three cases to become eligible for revenue\n\n1. Be subscribed to X Premium or Verified Organizations.\n2. Have at least 5M organic impressions on your cumulative posts within the last 3 months.\n3. Have at least 500 followers\n\nI wanted to figure out how much a tweet \"Could\" make per its views. According to CalculateBuddy, there is a rough estimation formula we can use for this which is:\n\nAdRevenue = 0.0000085 x Number of Impressions\n\nWe can receive a tweets number of views(impressions) and use the formula to calculate the potential of revenue received per that individual tweet"
