Or worse yet, cancelled?\n\nSee how reliable airlines are when you shop for flights on Google.  \n\nWhen you visit https://flights.google.com/ or https://www.google.com/flights, this extension will show you \nhow often an airline causes you delays & even cancelled flights.  You'll see these numbers on the screen next to an airline, color coded to tell you if it's more or less reliable than its competitors.  \n\nThis way you can ask yourself: Is the price difference worth it if you face a lower chance of actually getting to where you want to go?"
