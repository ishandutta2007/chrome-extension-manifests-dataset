Just click the icon to turn DIM on and bright pages will be gone forever.. or well.. until you turn DIM off.\n\nDIM utilises intelligent page styling and image processing algorithms that make sure every page looks great! It also has a thorough options page which lets you set exactly how DIM behaves. These options include theming, automating, image processing, whitelisting etc. You of course don't have to bother changing any of these settings in order to get DIM to run, we've already done that for you. These settings are just little extras that allow you to configure everything JUST the way you want it. There is a quick guide and tooltips for every option so you don't have to be an advanced user to figure it all out!\n\nSome of the features DIM has:\n✓ Easy one click toggling\n✓ Complete white/blacklisting system\n✓ Advanced methods for styling pages\n✓ CORS bypassing for images\n✓ Filtering based on HSV\n✓ Simple automation\n✓ Works for dynamically added content (AJAX loading etc.)\n✓ Caches images on a per page basis to improve page loading time\n✓ and many more..\n\nDIM is more than just a universal dark theme. It protects eyesight and prevents nearsightedness.\n\nLogo designed by Sebastian Amen (http://be.net/amen)."
