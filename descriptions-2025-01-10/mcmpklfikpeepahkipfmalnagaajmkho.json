The extension uses cheerio for web scraping and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 models for querying and generating response. For this reason, an OpenAI account is required. \n\nUpon first time usage, user is expected to provide an OpenAI API key, which will be encrypted and stored in Chrome's storage session. This information will persist until the browser is shut down.\n\nUser is given the power to customize their Shepherd with any GPT-3.5 model. They can change the model as well as reset their API key any time by going to the settings page. User can also hide chat history; with one click they can choose to see only the last Q&A. This feature was developed to give a clean and less clustered user interface.\n\nNote: please address the current web page as an article to the model. The model is trained to take in article inputs and yield better results when the content is addressed that way."
