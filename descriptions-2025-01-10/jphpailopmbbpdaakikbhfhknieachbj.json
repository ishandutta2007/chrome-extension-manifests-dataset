It is designed to allow you to quickly review status codes and headers for the requests that Chrome makes and the responses it receives. Headers are always listed alphabetically, and very long values are truncated to a single line until you hover over them with your mouse, to keep the list easy to read.\n\nDescriptions of common headers are included to help you understand what each one does. Clicking on a value will copy that header to the clipboard in the standard HTTP header format.\n\nThe extension's icon will display a badge indicating either the status code of the response, or the total number of requests the browser made, including redirects. The color of the badge always indicates the status of final response.\n\nThis extension is open source and the source code is available at https://github.com/farski/http-headers-crx"
