No need to reach for the mouse to turn on subtitles or go to the next episode. Make the shortcuts your own: each action is configurable.\n\n*‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE READ ‚ö†Ô∏è* March 28 2022: Netflix is currently *blocking* rapid time skips, leading to \"üõë ERROR M7375\". This is not an issue with the extension, but a protection that Netflix recently added, presumably in order to prevent scripts from downloading movies. An update to this extension is coming soon; in the meantime you might find that some \"time skip\" shortcuts will not work. Recent testing shows that pressing 0‚Äì9 to go to 0%‚Äì90% of the video seems to work, but short skips like +/- 10 seconds do not.\n\nEach shortcut is easily configurable with a click on the extension's icon at the right of the address bar. Make sure to \"pin\" the extension icon for easy access!\n\nCurrently available, all configurable:\n\n- Play or pause a video: K\n- Go back 10 seconds: J\n- Skip forward 10 seconds: L\n- Go back 60 seconds: Shift-J\n- Skip forward 60 seconds: Shift-L\n- (new) View show info or movie info, jump to episode, like/dislike: I\n- (new) View and edit watch history: H\n- Go back by 1 frame: , (comma)\n- Go forward by 1 frame: . (dot)\n- Toggle subtitles: C\n- Change subtitles language: V\n- Change subtitles size: S\n- Change audio track: A\n- Play slower: < (by how much can be changed)\n- Play faster: >\n- Play next episode: Shift-N\n- Play previous episode: Shift-P\n- Back up (save) current position: B\n- Restore saved position: R\n- \"Like\" with thumbs-up rating: + (plus)\n- \"Dislike\" with thumbs-down rating: - (minus)\n- Remove current rating: Shift-Backspace\n- Jump to 0%, 10%‚Ä¶ up to 90% of the video: press 0, 1‚Ä¶ up to 9\n- Set custom shortcuts for volume up/down\n- Configure the amount of volume change for your volume shortcuts\n- Some variants of the above and more are also available.\n- Jump forward/backward by *any* amount with a shortcut of your choice.\n\nA visual indicator can be configured for each action: there can be a very brief flashing symbol on the screen (with different styles), or just no indicator at all if you prefer it that way.\n\nYou can also create your own new shortcuts and assign them a custom number of seconds to jump by, forward or backward. For example, you can create a +10 minutes shortcut by setting the \"seconds\" value to 600 and choosing your own key combination.\n\nOther options also built-in:\n- Automatically skip series intro credits or episode recap (can be turned on or off)\n- Automatically play the next episode for series (can be turned on or off)\n- Automatically select your preferred language for subtitles\n- Automatically select your preferred subtitles size\n\nSuggestions, bug reports, feature requests and feedback are all welcome! Please send them by email to keyboard-playback@pm.me\n\nChanges in 1.1.2:\n- Prefer regular subtitles to descriptive.\n- Better fallback if subtitles language preference is not found.\n- Non-English languages: better subtitles language detection.\n\nChanges in 1.1.1:\n- New: add \"skip recap\" option, to skip the recap of a previous episode at the start of a new one.\n- Fix: toggling subtitles didn't always work.\n\nChanges in 1.1.0:\n- New: view movie info or series info by pressing [I] (configurable). Navigate with arrows and jump to another episode with [Enter]. Vote to like or dislike (can use configured keyboard shortcuts).\n- New: view watch history by pressing [H] (configurable). Navigate with arrows and delete entries with [Del] or [Backspace].\n- New: this extension is now available in English, French, and Spanish.\n- Better language detection for subtitles.\n- Cleaner design on Windows.\n\nPrivacy:\nThe extension does NOT track your data.
