The row ids were removed and the plugin can no longer work.\n\nTo help our internal bookkeeping workflow, we created this app which has the simple task of allowing the addition of comments on transactions shown in:\nhttps://c15.qbo.intuit.com/app/banking\n\nYou can use this extension to allow more efficient communication between the bookkeeper and the purchaser in the company.\n\nYou need to agree with your coworkers on a password, and enter it the first time the extension runs. The extension should automatically recognize the correct web page.\n\nImportant: this App is third-party and is not affiliated with Intuit or Quickbooks. Do not write personal information or sensitive details in those notes. The developers of this app do not have access to the data entered, as it is hosted by a third-party database service, unrelated to Tyto Robotics: https://keyvalue.immanuel.co"
