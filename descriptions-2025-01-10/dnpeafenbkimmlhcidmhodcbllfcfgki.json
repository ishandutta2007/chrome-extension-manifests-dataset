It is is my first foray into Javascript so it might not be quite as efficient as it could be. The original code was heavily based on HNBlocker by Finbarr Taylor (also available on Chrome Web Store) but has been heavily modified since.\n\nYou are free to borrow the source code for your own project but please provide credit if you do so. There are several articles on the internet that describe how to see the source code of an extension.\n\nHappy Blocking!"
