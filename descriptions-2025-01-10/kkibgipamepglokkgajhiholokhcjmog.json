Note that it's fairly important to use a pen-tablet or stylus for this web app.\n\nYou are tasked with replicating photos within 2 minutes each. Why that? We often tend to get lost in the details - things that don't really matter for the composition. Our creations and our productivity suffer as a result.\n\nWith the 2 minute time-limit you are forced to focus on the important aspects and make the most of every stroke. You will get more effective and efficient, plus you will study lots of interesting photos from Flickr!"
