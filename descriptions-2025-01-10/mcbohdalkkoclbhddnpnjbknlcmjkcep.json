Those JS snippets can be arranged into groups with unlimited nesting, and there is a nice UI to navigate through. Convinient editor and jQuery-like syntax for your code are another cool features.\n\nIt would be easier to understand how these JS shortcuts works, if you just install extension, take a look at it's settings and try out default config.\n\nQuick start: install, then open any page (http://example.com is a good one) and press \"E\", \"O\", \"Enter\" on your keyboard.\n\nPlease note: it will not work on any special pages, like new blank page, extensions list, etc., and Chrome Webstore - it's a browser restriction.\n\nPermission to read your data on all websites needed solely for inserting keypress listener.\n\nThis extension has an open source code, it can be found at https://github.com/dchekanov/scriptsnap.\n\nSuggested usage:\n\n1. Bookmarks: simple (just static URL), smart (URL dependent on current URL and/or page content), parameterized (URL with parameters values taken from user input), mixed (parameterized with extra logic).\n2. Page content and look modification: transform page in any way you may need to simplify your job.\n3. Small helping scripts, like calculations based on predefined formulas with variables dependent on page properties and user input.\n4. Server interaction via AJAX.\n\nDetails on how it works:\n\nKeystroke may be a sequence of any english letters and numbers 0-9. Each step in that sequence can have a JS code binded (optionally with field for user input) or serve as a container.\n\nThere is an UI to aid orienting in available keystrokes. It will be shown at left top corner. Keystokes will be represented in a nested lists, with each element consisting of title and corresponding key. Ones having code binded to them will have an ↳ symbol. If there is an input field, there will be an ↦ symbol, as well as some tip for what you are expected to type in. Branches will expand dynamically as you press keys. Current keystoke will be highlighted. Binded code can be executed and input be passed by pressing Enter."
