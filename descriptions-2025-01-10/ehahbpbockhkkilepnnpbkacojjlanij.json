Doing so manually consumes time and mind space.\n\nCheckoutBreeze automates this process for you. It automatically fills in each field and completes your test order in seconds. It's fast and you don't have to think about it.\n\nNOTE: CheckoutBreeze uses test credit cards provided by Shopify. It's not designed to make real purchases with real credit cards.\n\nRequirements for the app to work:\n\n* The store has test payments or the Bogus Gateway enabled\n* Credit card or the Bogus Gateway is the default payment method of the store\n* You must not click into / shift focus into another window while autofilling\n\nHint: Pin the extension to be able to quickly toggle it on and off!\n\n---\n\nSometimes Shopify updates their checkout or runs A/B tests that break CheckoutBreeze. In these cases, please try to delete site data (cookies, local storage, etc.) for your shop and/or send me an email. I'll look into it."
