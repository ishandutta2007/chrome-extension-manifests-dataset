My email address is located at the bottom of this text. \n\nThe extension is not going anywhere but the name will be fully updated in the next few versions.\n\nWhat is Zillow Data Exporter/Property Data Labs?\n\nThis extension lets you export Zillow property listings directly from your browser for free.\nYou can choose to save the property listings in a CSV or XLSX(Excel format) file.\n\nüìä What kind of listings can you export?\n\nYou can export 4 types of listings:\n- properties for sale\n- properties for rent\n- sold properties\n- saved/favorite properties\n\nSimply navigate to the page where the listings are located and use the drop down in the search bar on Zillow to select the type of properties to view. Then click the export button.\n\n‚ùì Do you need to create an account to use the Zillow Data Exporter/Property Data Labs?\n\nYes, you need to create an account before you can use the extension. \n\nWhen you create an account, you are automatically subscribed to the Free plan. You do not need to add your credit card number or pay anything to create an account.\n\n‚ùìHow many properties can you export on the Free plan per month?\n\nYou have 50 exports per month included on the Free plan. If you need more than that you can upgrade to one of our paid plans. \n\n1 export is basically one page of listings. There could be up to 40 listings per page, so in total, you should be able to export 2000 listings per month on the Free plan.\n\n‚ùì What kind of file formats are supported?\n\nThe extension can export listings to CSV and XLSX(Excel format). On the Free plan, you can only export CSV files.\n\n ‚ùì How many property listings can I export?\n\nYou can export 40 listings at a time on the Free plan. If your search results contain more than 40 listings, you will need to navigate to each page and click the export button each time.\n\nFor example, if you have a search that gives you 3 pages of results, you can export the first page, then navigate to page 2, export those listings and then navigate to page 3 and export the final property listings.\n\nThat should give you either 3 CSV or 3 Excel files which then can be combined based on your own needs.\n\nOn the Starter plan or on the Hobby plan, the extension will download all the listings automatically even if those listings are on multiple pages.\n\nThis is not a bug.\n\nüí∞  Is there a paid version of the extension with better features?\n\nYes, there are multiple paid plans.\n\nThe Hobby plan gives you:\n- 300 exports per month\n- export up to 800 listings at a time. \n- choose which columns you want to export to avoid polluting your CSV or Excel files with unwanted data.\n- remove empty columns from your exported files to keep the clutter to the minimum\n- export up to 35 data points per listings (it varies depending on the listing)\n- choose to always start from Page 1 or the current page when exporting listings\n- avoid exporting duplicate listings by choosing to export only listings you haven't exported in the last hour, day, week, month.\n- export all image urls from a listing\n- export all sub-listings for rent (units for rent located in a single building) if the data is available on the listing\n\nThe Starter plan gives you:\n- export data to Parquet files (only via the Cloud Importer)\n- everything from the Hobby plan\n- unlimited number of exports per month\n- export your files to Google Sheets automatically\n- save your exported listings history in your account\n- access to the Cloud Importer\n- access to the Cloud Monitor\n- you have the ability to create and use custom export templates so that you can easily switch your export settings without having to do any manual work in the extension\n\nüó∫Ô∏è  Which websites are supported?\n\n- zillow.com only hence the name.\n\nüìß How can I contact the team for feedback or support?\n\nYou can contact me, the extension‚Äôs creator if you need help or to report a bug by sending an email at: support@zillowdataexporter.com\n\nYou can also contact me by going to this page https://www.zillowdataexporter.com/contact and filling out the contact form.\n\nüßëüèª‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßëüèª  Great extension! How can I support it?\n\nIf you‚Äôre enjoying the extension, please consider leaving a five-star rating and telling your friends and family about it. Your support helps a lot and means a lot to me.\n\nüîí  What happens to my data?\n\nNothing. Your data is stored in your browser. I don‚Äôt have access to it. It is NOT backed up anywhere else. If you uninstall the extension, your data will be automatically deleted from your browser.\n\nOnly your file metadata is saved if you choose to do so. All the settings are opt-in settings. You can also opt-in to save your spreadsheets directly to Google Sheets. This functionality is available only on the paid Starter plan.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è  What is propertydatalabs.com?\n\nI am updating the extension's name and website to avoid any potential copyright infringements.\n\nSoon the website https://www.zillowdataexporter.com will redirect to https://www.propertydatalabs.com and eventually only the new website https://www.propertydatalabs.com will remain.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\n\nThe files are generated in your browser and I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THEM.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Disclaimer\n\nhttps://www.zillowdataexporter.com/disclaimer"
