Unfortunately, due to colour-blindness, many rugby fans find it difficult to even follow the match. That’s why we developed ‘See Green’, a Google Chrome extension to improve the viewing experience for all rugby fans with colour vision deficiency.\n\nSo, whether you have trouble Seeing Green, or any colour, install See Green to ensure you can follow all the action.\n\nHow to set up See Green:\n\n•Select the colour deficiency that is relevant to you (red, green or blue). If you don’t know which one applies, just select the row with the faintest IRFU crests.\n•Use the contrast slider to adjust the intensity of the colour correction until receiving the best result for you.\n•You can further adjust the strength of the filter by simply adjusting the strength slider.\n•Now you can just sit back and follow all the action.\n\nHow See Green works:\n\n•Colours are first altered by using a colour matrix to simulate the relevant colour deficiency.\n•Colours are then compensated for colour vision deficiency by an additional colour matrix – this step shifts wavelengths away from the portion of the spectrum invisible to the colour deficiency, towards the visible portion.\n•The end result emulates that of Daltonisation. Daltonisation is a colour correction technique that attempts to adjust colours in such a way that there are less colour combinations that would be confusing to someone with colour vision deficiency."
