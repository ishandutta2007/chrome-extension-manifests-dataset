After our apps on iOS, Mac and Web, we're excited to introduce  Async for Gmail & Chrome!\n\nEmail being the most popular async communications tool by far, and also, the coldest 🥶, we wanted to build the best way to bridge voice and email, right inside of Gmail.\n\n✉️ Announcing Async for Gmail\nHave you ever wanted to respond with a voice note to an investor asking for an update? A candidate? A ref check? A contractor you're working with? \n-> Add an async voice note right from Gmail’s compose window on Chrome (and Arc), and your recipient will be able to:\n✌️ listen to it, \n✌️ read the AI summary,\n✌️ read the transcript, \n✌️ add timestamp reactions to address the different topics in the note. \n\nAll of this without having to create an account!\n\nBut there’s one more thing:\n🌎 Meet Async for Chrome. \nSame extension, multiple powers! Sharing a quick voiceover on top of a docsend deck to give context on your raise? A Figma to give feedback on a new design? An airtable doc before sharing your new CRM with people?\n\nWell, that’s exactly what it does. Find our mic at the bottom right of the screen, start recording, and the URL you’re currently browsing is automatically attached to the voice note. Then share the unique link to any of your Gmail or iOS contacts or simply grab the URL and insert it anywhere. \n\nIt’s the fastest way to share feedback or context on anything you’re working on. Period!"
