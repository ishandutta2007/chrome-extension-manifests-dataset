In the tab user can see network logs and mocks. Any network call from the logs can be mocked by simply clicking mock button then response can be edited. User can also search logs. Mock can also be created from scratch from create mock button.\n\nDetailed Release notes: https://github.com/mukuljainx/Mokku/releases\n\nv2.0.6\nRemove sentry from inject script\nError handling while searching mocks\n\nv2.0.4\nFeature:\nload Mokku in separate window as well\nAdd sentry for error tracking\nMock headers from log as well\n\nv2.0.1\nFix: status not reflecting in mock\nFeat: add option to edit mocked log\n\nv2.0.0\nNew UI\nDark Theme\nResizable modal (log and mock)\nBetter code (allows adding feature quickly)\nBug fixes\n\nv1.8.2\nFixed the broken build.\n\nv1.8.0\nUpdates the manifest and other packages to latest version. Nothing new, this can break things but a required change to improve the extension and to release v2.0.0 \n\nv1.7.0\nAllow user to create multiple mocks with same url and method. On creating new mock any previous will be disabled, same goes for enabling any mock.\nAdds description field for mocks.\n\nv1.6.1\nBug fix\n\nv1.5.0\nAdd text response format.\n\n\nv1.4.0\nAuto format JSON after pasting, if valid\n\nv1.3.0\nImport and export Mocks\nCopy a mock for quick duplication\n\nv1.2.0\nNew JSON Editor with linting more verbose errors \n\nv1.1.0\nDynamic URL Mocking \nURL such as \n1. \"service/chat/user/:userId/messages\" can be added. All the URL such as \"service/chat/user/u1/messages\", \"service/chat/user/u2/messages\" etc will be matched though response will remain same. In future userId will available as param just like express and you can provide a handler function.\n\n2. \"service/some/thing/(.*)\" can also be added, (.*) will match anything just like the above.\n\nAll URL's are accessible but Mokku doesn't inject scripts into any pages apart from which are served locally and accessed using 'http://localhost*' until enabled from the Panel.\n\nCollections & Dynamic mock generators coming soon!\n\nYou can submit issues, bugs or feature request at https://github.com/mukuljainx/mokku/issues"
