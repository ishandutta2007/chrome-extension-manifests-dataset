I am not responsible for any missing/damaged teams through the use of this project**\n\nHow does this work?\n\nThis extension backs up and downloads a text file of the showdown_teams value in localStorage that is used to store a user's teams. The restore function uses the same showdown_teams key and injects the value of an uploaded text file. As this extension works locally, any file uploaded is merely for the extension to process and inject data into the browser and is not uploaded to any server.  Nevertheless, be wary of what text files you load into the extension and only use the ones that you have generated.\n\nThis project is open source!
