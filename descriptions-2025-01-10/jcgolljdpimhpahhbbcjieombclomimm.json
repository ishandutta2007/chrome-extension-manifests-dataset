Along the way, we bookmark many of the sites we find, for later deep diving. As it happens, you always end up forgetting about some of the saved items. This is pretty bad when the things you saved are important either for your work or for personal use. Some of us use pocket or similar bookmark management apps, but unfortunately, the number of bookmarks always piles up and becomes close to unmanageable. This is the reason why we developed a super simple google chrome extension that will remind you of the most recent saved bookmarks and will help you NOT FORGET about the important things you saved for later.\n\nThe first version of the product brings the following features:\n- 1x per day (by default at noon) a reminder message is triggered inside your google chrome browser, showing a random bookmark you saved\n- the reminder message displays 2 buttons, so when the message appears you can choose between: \"not interested\" and \"remind me in 30 min\"\n- you can trigger the reminder manually at any given time, and it will always display another saved bookmark\n- the reminder does NOT display any bookmark more than once unless you select \"remind me later\""
