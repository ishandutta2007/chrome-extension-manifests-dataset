The Chrome version has a few missing features, and doesn't perform as well as the native versions. It also only supports x86_64 based hardware (e.g., ARM-based Chromebooks are not supported).\n\nThis is a alpha release of a port of the Beam pilot software to Chrome. It is missing many of the features from the native Windows and Mac client. Here is a partial list:\n- Gamepad support\n- Screensharing support\n- XMPP/HTTPS proxy support\n- Language support\n- Playout device enumeration\n\nThe Beam pilot software is used to drive Beam Smart Presence Systems (https://suitabletech.com/).
