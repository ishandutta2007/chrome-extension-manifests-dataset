It has two modes: an RPN-mode and a stack-mode. The well known RPN stands for Reverse Polish Notation and it saves you time as it avoids the use of parenthesis. The only catch is that the entry of data is a bit different to what most people expect, so you have to learn to work with it. The stack-mode of this calculator is new. It's a bit similar to RPN in the way that is also uses a stack an avoids the use of parenthesis. But it's unique in the way that it has no reversed data entry but follows the 'normal' sequence. All calculations can be done by use of the keyboard, so no time consuming mouse clicks. It can handle both real and complex numbers and supports different notations. Mouse Stack-Calculator is available as Chrome extension, as desktop app and can run in a webbrowser window.\n\nMain features\n\n- Flexible and intuitive user interface\n- Complete insight in entered expression\n- All the advantages of RPN in RPN-mode\n- Keyboard for all data entry (as you would expect from a calculator)\n- Most frequent used instructions only need 1 key;
