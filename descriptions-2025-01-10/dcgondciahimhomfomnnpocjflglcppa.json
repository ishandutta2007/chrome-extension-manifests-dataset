There is no need to do anything else.\nIf you are using Gmail POP3 emails to retrieve emails from other email accounts, you may have noticed that it sometimes checks for new emails very slowly.\n\nWith Gmail POP3 auto-refresh, you can refresh an unlimited number of POP3 email accounts at a rate of one minute for free.\n\nClick on the extension, it will open Gmail on the right page and automatically refresh POP3 emails. Just leave this page open and open a new one to view your emails which will finally be up to date!\n\nFeedback and comments are welcome. Feel free to contact me at contact@evanjuge.fr if you have any problems.\nI will see your email very soon because I use my own extension!"
