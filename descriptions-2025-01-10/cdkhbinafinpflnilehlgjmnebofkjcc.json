You don't have to deal with the bad styling, slow navigation and the inability to annotate. \n\nWhat LUReaderDownloader does:\n\t1. The extension detects which reader you are viewing and offers to download when you open the extension.\n\t2. The pages will get downloaded by the extension, merged to one PDF and saved to your downloads.\n\nNote: LUReaderDownloader only lets you download readers you own.\n\nDisclaimer: This extension is not affiliated with Leiden University and it may stop working at any time when they decide to change the way readers work. Ideally you should bother your course coordinators so they can bother the appropriate people to spend some resources to improve the situation. \n\nRelease notes:\nhttps://github.com/MiraiSubject/ReaderDownloader/releases\n\nSource code is available here:\nhttps://github.com/MiraiSubject/ReaderDownloader\n\nFound a bug or have a feature request? (and if we share a group chat you can also tag me)\nhttps://github.com/MiraiSubject/ReaderDownloader/issues"
