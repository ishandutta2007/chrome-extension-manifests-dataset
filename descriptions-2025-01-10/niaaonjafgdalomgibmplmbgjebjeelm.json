There are three levels of difficulty, differing in the size of the maze. To help the player, the game has a map of the entire maze, but it is not always available, which forces memory training.\n\nSelect the difficulty level and go through the maze.\nTo go through the labyrinth, you need to collect three keys and find the exit door from the labyrinth.\nControl is carried out by pressing the left mouse button or touching the screen, as well as using the arrow keys."
