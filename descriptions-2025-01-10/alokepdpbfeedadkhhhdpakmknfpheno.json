What has bothered me is that when I move the browser off-centre, the audio and video do not align anymore. I see the person giving the speech from an angle, but I hear them from the centre. This feels jarring.\n\nTo solve the above problem, I wrote this extension. For a given tab that's running Youtube, I can navigate to the extension popup and turn on stereo. Now the tab's audio follows the video wherever it goes on my desktop. And when I turn the extension off, the tab's audio goes back to normal.\"\n- Riku Soikkeli, the author of the extension\n\nFor those people who either don't sit at the centre of their monitor setup, or who have monitors connected to their PC which are not part of their work setup, there's extra configurations to make sure that the audio is always adjusted correctly.\n\nIn the extension's popup, there's the \"Centre\" button which allows the user to define their own non-default centre against which all deviations are calculated. In the popup, the user can also unselect those displays which are not part of their work setup.\n\nSo far, the extension only supports Youtube and Windows. The extension also requires stereo speakers to work properly. The speakers need to be positioned somewhat correctly on the user's sides."
