There is no setup and no connections or permissions. We don't take any data from your wallet; we don't have access to your tokens.\n\nWhen you use the MetaMask desktop browser extension with all decentralised exchanges or aggregators (swap applications such as Uniswap, Pancake and 1inch), Wallet Guardian will scan the token you want to swap to for scams and threats in a few seconds.   \n\nWhat you will see: \n\nOnce you click Swap, the Wallet Guardian browser extension will open automatically; you have nothing to do, and scanning the token smart contract (Ethereum - ERC20 and BNB Chain- BEP20) will start automatically. \n\nYou will see the result in a few seconds as a colour RED for STOP, YELLOW for ATTENTION and GREEN for CLEAR. \n\nIt is then up to you if you decide to reject or confirm in MetaMask. You choose, but we always recommend you do your own research as the decision and responsibility are solely yours.\n\nWe hope you like this first version of Wallet Guardian, and we will release NFT scanning and more Blockchain networks soon. Mobile versions will follow.\n\nPlease come and join our Guardians of the Blockchain - GBC.AI Telegram community and let us know what you think and would like to see: https://t.me/gbc_ai\n\nFind out more here: https://gbc.ai/"
