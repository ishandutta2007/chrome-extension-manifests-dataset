When building a team for formats that don't play at level 100, such as official Battle Spot or Little Cup, these bars look really bad because it's still comparing a level 50 Pokémon's stats to a level 100.\n\nThis extension tries to scale the color and length of the stat bars to the equivalent at level 100 so that you can have a better intuition of whether a stat is good among its peers, especially after some investment."
