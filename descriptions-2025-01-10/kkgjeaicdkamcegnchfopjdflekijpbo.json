Want to spice things up? Or prank your friends? Introducing WordQuake, an application that transforms entire webpages before your very eyes. Create new meanings from online news articles, editorials, classic literature...even your best friend's Facebook posts. \n\nWordQuake runs on WordNet, a database developed at Princeton University that maps the relationships between tens of thousands of nouns in the English language. Our program accesses this database to analyze your text on the fly and hands you back a unique blend of chaos and creativity. In particular, each noun on a webpage is located in WordNet and then replaced by a random neighboring noun in WordNet.\n\nClick the WordQuake icon on any webpage to begin quaking! To return to the original page, simply refresh your browser. Addressing privacy concerns: no data is accessed unless the WordQuake icon is clicked, and no data is stored on our server.\n\nFeatured on WordNet 'Related Projects' page: http://www.princeton.edu/wordnet/related-projects/.\n\nQuestions?
