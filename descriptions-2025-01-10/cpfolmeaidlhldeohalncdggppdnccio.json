Available for Salesforce, Hubspot, Pipedrive, Zoho, and Redtail.\n\nScreen Pops: Connector will initiate a search in the target CRM or website of the inbound calling number. This feature is supported in over 80 CRMs and websites.\n\nClick to call: By clicking on a number on a website, an inbound call will be initiated to your extension and then connected to the dialed number.\n\nIn order to use Connector, use your standard Business Voice credentials (username and password) for Single-Sign-on convenience.\n\nPlease note your user profile must be licensed for Connector.  Unlicensed extensions will not be able to log-in and will get a message that the user is not entitled.\n\nIf you need help enabling your user profile to use the Connector extension, please contact your IT Administrator, Sangoma Partner, or Sangoma sales or customer support representative."
