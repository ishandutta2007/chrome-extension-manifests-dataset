Create lists of tasks, check as complete, highlight priority, delete, sort, share and calendarize!.\n\nLanguage coverage includes English, Spanish, German, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, Bengali, Russia, Portuguese, Urdu.\n\nMany to do lists are over engineered and veer towards calendar events and project management. TTDList is designed for fast task additions that can be sent to calendars as events and also shared quickly without sign ons or risking having your data stored on third party servers.\n\nData is stored in the browser. This means it is private to you. However as this is a cache store, if the browser cache is cleared then this data will be deleted.\n\nOur aim is to keep this as simple as possible with as little distraction on the page.\n\nWe look forward to your ideas to improve TTDList.\n\nHappy Tasking!",
