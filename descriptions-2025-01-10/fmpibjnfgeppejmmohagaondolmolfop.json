Once people get to certain point in their progress they enter a Code Ninjas created software known as GDP. This software does not auto-save which results in many people losing their code. Hence this extension; created by a Code Ninjas Newport Beach employee in order to prevent losing code from ever happening again. Happy coding -Joseph (: \n\n(this extension is currently in beta testing), feel free to send possible issues."
