Below is the list of its functions and the rationale behind them:\n\nHiding the timeline (progress bar) during the game:\nWhen the game is close near its end and the viewer moves their mouse or skips an ad block, they will instantly spoil the results by seeing how much (approximately, of course) time is left in the game - by deducing whether the game went into OT or not.\n\nHiding the clock:\nSame reason, as someone who watches most of the games, seeing whether the game took 2:30 or 3:20 will instantly tell me whether it went into OT or not most of the time (barring some special circumstances).\n\nHiding the match panel on the right:\nDuring the playoff, when trying to watch a series-clinching game, seeing there's another game planned in 2 days kinda gives up the result eh?\n\nRemoving the \"fade\" effect that comes up whenever viewer moves the mouse or uses a keyboard shortcut\nThis is just annoying, especially if there's no control bar visible."
