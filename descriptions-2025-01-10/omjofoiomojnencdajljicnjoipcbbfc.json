Here's what makes Orian truly exceptional:\n\nKey Features\nVersatile Chat System:\nEngage with an open-source chat system that provides insightful responses powered by your local Language Model (Ollama LLM).\n\nGmail Integration:\n\nEmail Interaction: Chat with your emails for personalized and seamless communication.\nQuick Replies: Effortlessly reply to emails with AI-generated suggestions (currently limited to yes or no).\nEmail Composition: Rewrite and compose new emails with prompts directly from your inbox. You can further tailor the email by clicking the create button to generate a prompt that will adjust the email as you expect.\n\nGoogle Search Enhancement:\nLLM Responses: Receive AI-generated responses for your Google search queries. (Note: Live search functionality is currently under maintenance and will be released soon.)\n\nNote: Initially, the Gmail Integration and Google Search Enhancement features are turned off. To enable them, click the + icon in the input box of the side panel to go to settings, and then navigate to the settings page to turn them on and save the settings.\n\nAlso, the model used for generation is the one set in the side panel. Ensure you change the model there to suit your needs.\nWe are also working on including features for LinkedIn integration.\n\nContextual Website Interaction:\nSelect specific parts of web pages to interact with, enabling more tailored and relevant AI assistance. When the side panel is open, you can select text from any website and chat with the selected part.\nIf not working, reloading the website will fix the issue. Otherwise, this feature may not be compatible with that specific website.\n\nAI-Powered Side Panel:\n1 .Panel:\nAccess an intelligent side panel using a simple keyboard shortcut Crtl+Shift+Left on windows (or Cmd+Shift+Left on mac), providing quick AI assistance and interaction without leaving your current web page. This includes the ability to chat with documents like PDFs and coding language files, provided they contain text.\nCode Generation:\nGenerate visually appealing code snippets\n\n2. Settings Customization:\nEasily enable or disable email and Google search features through the settings page.\n\n3. Website Chat:\nEngage in conversations with entire websites to get tailored responses and obtain exactly what you need from the website.\n\nBenefits\nEffortless Integration:\nSeamlessly connect with your local Ollama LLM to leverage advanced AI capabilities within your browser.\n\nImproved Communication:\nEnhance your email interactions with intelligent, context-aware responses and composition tools.\n\nInnovative Web Interaction:\nInteract with web content in new and intuitive ways, making your browsing experience more productive and enjoyable.\n\nOrian (Ollama WebUI) transforms your browser into an AI-powered workspace, merging the capabilities of Open WebUI with the convenience of a Chrome extension. Experience the future of browsing with Orian, the ultimate web UI for Ollama models.\n\nNote: The AI results depend entirely on the model you are using. For example, using a deepseekcoder model for email generation may not yield the expected results. Ensure that the Ollama app is running locally, as the extension will not function without it.\n\nWe are continuously improving our product. If you encounter any issues or notice features not working as expected, please contact us. Reloading the extension in the extensions page will fix some of the issues if encountered. Please note that the document chatting is not RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)."
