The platform is built on open source Selenium and offers excellent automated test tracking, management and reporting; enabling centralized, version-controlled test catalogs for a range of external interfaces, yields, licenses as well as workforce cost reductions while significantly boosting productivity in an agile-iterative product development lifecycle. \n\nQARA supports remote test execution, grid execution, multi-browser, multi-platform testing, test scheduling, test case management and test data preparation along with JIRA and Team Foundation Server (TFS) integration. QARA also supports testing with Angular JS, BrowseEmAll, BrowserStack and Grid Execution giving users the ease of handling tests using just one platform. \n\nQARA is tailor-made for organizations that wish to convert their manual test cases to automation scripts with a lean automation engineering team and want to dramatically reduce the testing cycle times without compromising on the quality of test scripts which get automatically generated. It presently generates Selenium C# which can help the testing departments service larger client needs and focus on improved team productivity. CIOs can now vouch for QARA to suit their automation needs as it works seamlessly with products developed using Sun, Microsoft and all open source technologies."
