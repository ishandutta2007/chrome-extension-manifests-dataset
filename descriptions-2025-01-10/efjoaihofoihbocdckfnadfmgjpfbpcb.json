You can also specify relationships between environments and modes so that the environments will change alongside the modes. \n\nWith Snap Environment Switcher/Exadel Environment Switcher for AEM, you can:\n\n - create an unlimited number of projects\n - configure several modes and environments\n - easily switch back and forth between your modes and environments\n - switch between environment domains \n - create several sub-environments (an environment with the same name that corresponds to another mode)\n - set up a relationship between your sub-environments and modes, so when you change the mode, the sub-environment and domain will change automatically, too \n - switch to a new mode or environment in a new tab\n - share plugin configurations between team members through the Import and Export operations\n - keep track of your current operating state—you’ll never be confused about which project, environment, and mode you’re in\n\nHave fun!"
