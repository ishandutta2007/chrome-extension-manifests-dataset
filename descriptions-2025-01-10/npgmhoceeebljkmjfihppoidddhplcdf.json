It offers simple keyboard shortcuts for Chrome and Chromebook users to manage their windows more effectively. Here's what it does:\n\nIt lets you move a window to one of three spots across the screen while keeping it stretched from top to bottom, so you can easily see three different windows next to each other.\nIt also allows you to adjust a window's height to either fill the top half or bottom half of the screen. With a quick keyboard shortcut, you can toggle between these height settings."
