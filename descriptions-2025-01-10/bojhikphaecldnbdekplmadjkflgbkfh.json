(transparentmode will always be active in the background while drawmode is enabled(so the scene doesnt redraw its background))\n\n4.500\n- Performance improvement, found a bug in code that resized the canvas each frame. Drawmode is back and working (except for in opengl scenes: spinningcube, sinusmode and madness)\nCanvas is no longer following scrolling. \n\n4.420.9\n- Madness Scene added :O\n\n4.420.8\n- stability and performance update and removed drawmode(was not working with newer chrome).\n\n4.420.7.2\n- Canvas width will no longer make a vertical scrollbar, and canvas will now be locked to scroll height. (can make it an option, if anyone actually liked being able to scroll away from the canvas)\n\n4.420.7\n- New icon! :)\n\n4.420.5-6\n- New feature: DrawMode (located under settings) for cool effects (does not work on hexagon, spinningcube or sinuscolormix)\n- Save Scene Bugfix\n\n4.420.1-4\n- bugfixes (context offset ++) new forked-scene (PainScene from WormScene)\n- Added full-screen setting.\n\n4.420\n- two new scenes(DotsAndLines and ParticleCircle), better options and options experience and general code improvements(hopefully).\n\n4.20\n- Major bugfix regarding spectrum data, so everything is much better now.\n  revamped some scenes, added webgl support and addeed 2 new webgl scenes.\n\n3.52042\n- fftSize added to options\n\n3.420\n- fleshed out options\n\n2.43\n- stability etc\n\n2.41\n- improved gui/options and errorhandling\n\n2.37\n- categorized gui + new scene \"Swipe\"\n\n2.36\n- Custom example included, changed some scenes(some earlier saves may break)\n\n2.35:\n- Now you can save and load custom scenes, and view/delete them in extension options."
