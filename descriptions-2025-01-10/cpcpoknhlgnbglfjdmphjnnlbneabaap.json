As some w**ker company has parked my domain, it was dumping advertisements in the extension. I have fixed this (v 1.0.6)\n\nThe Memelords Lenny Face extension is designed to give you an easy way of accessing your favourite one-line ASCII arts. These include things such as your favourite Lenny Face, the Nazi symbol, and much more! New ones will be added, including ones from requests sent via email.\n\nTo copy some art, you do not need to highlight it. Simply right click and it'll automatically highlight the line, bringing up the menu, and thus, you can instantly hit \"copy\".\n\nFor bug reports and to request a new piece of art to be added, feel free to email here:\ntom@byonex.co.uk\nThis extension is provided to you free, and that also means ad free. To support this and future plugins, I rely heavily on donations.\nIf you can ever help out, please, donate or send money to:\ntom@byonex.co.uk\n\nEvery little helps <3"
