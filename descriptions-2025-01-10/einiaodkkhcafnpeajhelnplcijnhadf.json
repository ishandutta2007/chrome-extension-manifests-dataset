However, when you think about it in terms of how many hours you'd have to work in order to purchase it, it changes your perspective on the value of the product entirely.\n\nJust enter your yearly or hourly wage and start highlighting prices on your screen. Spending Buddy will automatically calculate the number of hours of work the price tag equals.\n\nThis tool is especially useful for chronic online shoppers or people looking to become more frugal with their purchases. It only works when you highlight prices and numbers, so you can leave it on and highlight text as you normally would."
