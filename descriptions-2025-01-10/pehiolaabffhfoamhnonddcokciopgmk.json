You have 45 seconds to get to 36 points. Each donut you collect in the \"Hole-y Holder\" basket being held by \"Donut Don\" will result in a point being added to your score. But, each piece of broccoli you put in the basket will result in a point being taken away. Drag your mouse across the game screen left to right and right to left to have Don collect those donuts! If you fail to collect enough donuts or get too much broccoli in the basket, you can always replay the game! Good luck to you!!"
