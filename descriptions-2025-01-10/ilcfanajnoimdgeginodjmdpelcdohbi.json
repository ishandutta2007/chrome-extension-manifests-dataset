This extension is designed to read one or multiple \"enex\" files and prompt for the Evernote password used to encrypt these blocks. Subsequently, the extension replaces the encrypted blocks with decrypted content. Additionally, users can instruct the extension to convert complex HTML blocks into text-only equivalents. If your new note-taking application supports encrypted blocks, you can also request the extension to generate a compatible block for seamless integration.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Decrypts all encrypted embeddings in \"enex\" files.\n2. Optionally replaces complex HTML blocks with text-only equivalents.\n3. Re-encrypts each block using a user-defined encryption.\n\nUsage:\n1. Decryption Process:\n   - Upload one or multiple \"enex\" files to the extension.\n   - Enter the Evernote password used for encrypting blocks.\n   - The extension seamlessly replaces encrypted blocks with decrypted content.\n\n2. Optional HTML Block Conversion:\n   - Users can choose to convert complex HTML blocks to text-only equivalents for enhanced compatibility.\n\n3. Re-encryption with User-defined Algorithm:\n   - Specify your preferred encryption algorithm for re-encrypting each block according to your new application's requirements.\n\nThis tool operates entirely offline, ensuring the encryption and decryption processes occur locally. No data is sent or received from any remote server, reinforcing user privacy and security throughout the entire process."
