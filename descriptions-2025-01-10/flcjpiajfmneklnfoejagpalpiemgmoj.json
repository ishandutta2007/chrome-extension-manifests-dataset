But this is different, really different. \n\nWith Catadoo, you get a cute little cat who goes by the name of Turbo whom you will have to look after like an actual cat. \n\n😻🙀😽😻🙀😽😻🙀😽😻🙀😽😻🙀😽\n\nDo😻\nComplete your tasks → earn crystals → buy food → feed Cat → Cat lives 😻\n\nDon't🙀\nIgnore tasks → health drops → RIP 🙀\n\nFeatures\n\n- Todolist\n- Create sub tasks for tasks\n- Hide everything\n- A really really cute cat\n- more features soon (if you tell me, I'll add them)\n\n\n### How does this work?\n\nCatadoo works like any other todo list out there. You add tasks and complete them. But here’s the catch! When you complete tasks, you’ll receive crystals. Crystals are the currency that can be used to trade with other resources at the shop.\n\nWith enough crystals, you can buy food or milk for your Cat. Food and Milk keep them strong and healthy, so if you don’t take care of them, they’ll eventually die. So, keep the cat alive at all cost!\n\n### Shop\n\nThe shop is where you can trade your crystals that you acquired by completing tasks for resources such as food and other things. \n\nHealth Meter\n\nYour cats health decreases by 10 points every hour, so by the Thirteenth hour, your cat will be no more😞. So keep an eye on the health meter and use your crystals to buy resources from the shop.\n\nRestore to Life\n\nIf your cat succumbs to death, then you can restore it to life but it’ll cost you all your resources and you’ll have to start all over again.\n\n### Frequency of Earning Crystals\n\nTo keep the game challenging, you won’t receive crystals for every task you complete. But to keep it fair to you, occasionally you will receive multiple crystals for a single task.\n\n\nIf you have some feedback, feel free to contact me at jbnj@ottoapp.me or slide into my dms on twitter [https://twitter.com/iamnottheway](https://twitter.com/iamnottheway)\n\nFeedback : https://airtable.com/shrFBadJ03QzN6kT4\n\n😻🙀😽😻🙀😽😻🙀😽😻🙀😽😻🙀😽\n\n\nChangelog v.0.5\n- You can now enable/disable sounds in the settings dialog\n- Add sub tasks \n- Enable/Disable subtasks \n- Hide Mode - Hides everything on the screen (use this while sharing your screen or presenting)\n- increased health points for food\n\nChangelog v.0.6\n- You can now edit tasks\n- Health doesn't change when the pause/focus button is on"
