All data are stored inside your Chrome local storage, a special memory your browser has, so exclusively inside your device.\n\n\n\nHOW MANY WANTED LIST AND CARTS CAN I UPLOAD?\n\nThere is virtually no limit to the number of WL and carts you can upload, except for the Chrome local storage memory, which is about 5 MB.\nBut you would really need to have an insane amount of WL and carts to exceed it.\nI tested the extension with a couple WL of thousands of elements and it was ok.\n\n\n\nHOW DO I INTERPRET THE COLORS IN THE EXCEL?\n\nInside the generated Excel File, you will find a second sheet called 'Color Guide' that will explain you everything.\n\n\n\nSPECIAL CASES\n\n1 - USED ITEMS: When reading the WL BrickBuddy© doesn't distinguish between New, Used or Any condition.\nSo if you have 3 lots of the same item, all with the same color (1 new, 1 used, 1 any), you will see three of them in the table loaded in the User Interface, but in the Excel File will be merged in a single row with wanted quantity equal to the sum of the quantities specified for each lot.\nThe Excel file will still notify how many of the selected items are Used in a comment inside the cell (Used items cells have RED BOLD text)\n\n2 - COLOR NOT APPLICABLE: In the WL it is possible not specify the color for a certain part, leaving it as \"Not Applicable\".\nUsually is done for parts that will not be visible in the final build, so can be of any color.\nIf you have lots with \"Not Applicable\" color in your WL, BrickBuddy© will interpret the lots in your carts with the same Bricklink Code as candidates to fill that \"Not Applicable\" wanted items (unless you have a wanted lot with that specific color).\nExample: you have a WL with 10 1x1 bricks white and 10 'Not Applicable', and a cart with 5 1x1 bricks blue, 5 red and 10 white.\nThe 10 white will fill the lot with the color white specified, the 5 red and 5 blue will fill the 'Not Applicable' lot.\nIn the Excel file, the 'Not Applicable' rows will have specified in the store cells comment the quantity for each color"
