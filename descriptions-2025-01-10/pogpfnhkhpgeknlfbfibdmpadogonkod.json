You can discover for example that autonomous driving research is booming. You can find out if a topic will likely grow for the next years or if it has already peaked. \nWhether you are an academic researcher, a wanna be entrepreneur, a journalist, a venture capital firm, or a curios citizen, this extension is for you! It requires no special permissions and is free to use.\nIf you find any problem, please report it in the appropriate section before leaving a negative review, I will do my best to fix it!"
