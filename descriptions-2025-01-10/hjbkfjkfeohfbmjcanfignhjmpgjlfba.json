These channel points can be used to purchase rewards from the streamer's channel for your dedication to their stream. The extension tracks how many gift boxes it has collected and runs in the background so all you have to do is open a new tab and navigate to the streamer(s) that you want to collect from. Spawn as many tabs as you want and it will collect the channel point gift boxes from each stream you have started!"
