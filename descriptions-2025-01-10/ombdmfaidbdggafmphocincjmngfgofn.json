Can't stand someone and don't want to see them @mentioned? This is the extension for you.\n\nMuting and unmuting #tags and @mentions is accessed via the context menu â€” just right-click on a #tag or a @mention (known issue: due to the asynchronous nature of Chrome's context menus, the Hashmute menu might not be displayed on your first right-click; try closing the menu and right-clicking again).\n\nMuted tweets are still displayed, collapsed and dimmed, so you can still click on them and expand them (on the timeline) or open them (on the new profiles)."
