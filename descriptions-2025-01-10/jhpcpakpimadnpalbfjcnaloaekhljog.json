See the netusage website for full list of supported ISPs.\n\nPermissions Explanations:\n\n* Your data on all websites\nNeeded to fetch/scrape usage information from your ISP's website.\n\n* Your tabs and browsing activity\nNeeded to open a new tab to display your ISP's usage page (for the open ISP page option)."
