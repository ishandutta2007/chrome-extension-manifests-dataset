The extension is very simple, but it provides a lot of details for a current weather and even hourly and daily weather forecast.\nThe data is fetched from OpenWeather and if you have your own API key it is highly recommended to set it in the extension options for better extension performance. You can also choose Celsius or Fahrenheit temperature units (Celsius is default).\nNow you can see the weather of the current web site location.\n\nYou can check our web page: https://weatherforfree.rf.gd/"
