This extension allows you to see those captions on the YouTube website.\n\nCross captions are designed to let you understand a language you don't speak in real time. You can immerse yourself right away, without knowing a single word.\n\nThe AxTongue website/app has many features that are not available with this extension, including a system for generating cross captions with AI, and a sophisticated flashcard-like system that integrates into videos. And there are many other features. However, the basic concept everything else revolves around, viewing cross captions, is fully available in this extension."
