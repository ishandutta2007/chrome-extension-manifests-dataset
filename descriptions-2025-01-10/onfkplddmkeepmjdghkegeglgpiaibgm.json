Inclusion on the watch list may be due to lack of adequate peer review or other fundamental standards of scientific publishing integrity. There are definitely false negatives, and there may be false positives.\n\nYou can now also filter PubMed search results by journal impact factor. To do this, go to the extension options and set an impact factor threshold and also upload a list of journal impact factors for the extension to use (CSV format). See screenshots for details.\n\nSubmit corrections and comments to davidaustincraig@gmail.com. Thank you!"
