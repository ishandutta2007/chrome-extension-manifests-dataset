This extension is designed to allow the developer to quickly swap environments when they are on a page while keeping their path intact.\n\nDomain Switcher allows you to organize the environments for the various projects you work on. Simply create a \"project\" on the options page and enter the associated domains for the various environments for the project. We'll do the rest, and you'll be able to simply switch between environments by clicking the arrow icon in your address bar when you are on a page that matches one of your project environments.\n\nFor example, if you are working on a project about \"coffee\", you could enter environments: \"localhost:3000\", \"test.coffee.com\", \"coffee.com\". Then, when you are on any of these domains, you will have an icon in your URL bar that will allow you to switch to the other environments. The path of the page you are on is preserved in the URL.\n\nThis extension is open-source and hosted on GitHub. If you find an issue, help out by posting it there as an issue or submit a pull request. https://github.com/stevehanson/domain-switcher-chrome"
