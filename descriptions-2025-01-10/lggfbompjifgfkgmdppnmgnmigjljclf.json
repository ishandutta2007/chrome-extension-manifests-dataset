Users can input URLs into a text field, select how the links open (in new tabs or windows), and set a delay between opening each URL.\n\nKey Features:\n\n- Mass URL Opening: Users can paste multiple URLs into a text box, and the tool opens them all in either new tabs or windows based on the selected option.\n- Selection Mode: Pressing the \"Z\" key enables a mode where users can highlight specific URLs on a page, then press \"Z\" again to open only the selected ones.\n- Opening Delay: A custom delay can be set between opening each URL, helping to control the flow of opened links and avoid overloading the browser.\n- Auto URL Formatting: URLs are auto-corrected by adding \"https://\" when needed, ensuring all links open properly.\n\nHow to Use Selected Links:\n\n- Activate Selection Mode: Press the \"Z\" key to enable selection mode. A dashed selection box will appear, allowing you to click and drag over the area containing the links you want to select.\n- Select Links: As you drag, the tool will highlight all visible links within the selected area.\n- Open Selected Links: Once your links are selected, press \"Z\" again to open all highlighted links in new tabs.\n- Cancel Selection: If you want to cancel the selection, press the \"ESC\" key to reset the selection without opening any links.\n\nThis feature gives you more control over which links to open, perfect for when you only need specific URLs from a webpage.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Efficiency: Saves time by opening multiple URLs at once, either from a list or selected on a page.\n- User Control: Customize how links are opened, with the option to set a delay for a smoother experience.\n- Easy to Use: Simple interface with keyboard shortcuts and flexible options, making it accessible for any user."
