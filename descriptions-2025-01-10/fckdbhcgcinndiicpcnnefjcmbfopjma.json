Wait a few seconds and your roster should print. Either print it or save it as PDF.\n\n** If you have more than 100 students, you'll need to print them 100 at a time by clicking the \">\" button at the bottom of the class list, as Banner only supports 100 entries per page.\n\n*** If you use a content blocker, please be sure to whitelist wichita.edu in order for this to work!\n\n**** Finally, if you have problems, please let me (John Hammond) know.  It's a fragile hack that relies on Banner working the way it does right now (including some entries that are misspelled!).  Please be patient :-) \n\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/jmhammond/visual-student-roster"
