It requires that your login details are auto-filled so that we never see or directly interact with your details. This extension will activate when you land on a firefly login page. So any URL beginning with any of the following URL's : \"https://caterham.fireflycloud.net/login/*\", \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/*\", \"https://federation.caterhamschool.co.uk/*. \nOnce activated the extension will click a button on the first page of the login process, taking you to the second page. Upon that page opening it will send a message to the driver via the browser requesting that the user click enter. By clicking enter the user will complete the actual login faze. This relys on the user having entered their own password or having it saved in a password manager. The script simply 'clicks' the input box so that upon pressing enter the login details are checked by the server. The next page that will pop up to the user as part of the firefly login process it a checkbox asking if you want to see that checkbox appear less. The extension will automatically click this checkbox. Following this the user will arrive on the firefly page they were attempting to access. That is the complete usage of the extension. This extension saves your time by doing the annoying box clicking for you while maintaining user privacy and security."
