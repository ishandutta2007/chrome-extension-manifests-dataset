With one simple click, Print My Recipe automatically finds and triggers the hidden “Print” button on any recipe page, instantly presenting you with a clean, print-friendly version—ready to save, print, or share. It’s the simplest way to get straight to the recipe without distractions.  \n\nHere’s how it works. First, the extension scans the webpage for buttons or links that function as print triggers. It looks for text containing “print,” common class or ID names, or onclick functions that call window.print(). If it finds a match, it clicks the button for you, instantly opening the recipe in its clean print view.  \n\nIf no print button exists, the extension uses smart fallback logic to extract the recipe directly from the page. It scans for structured recipe data that websites often include using schema.org standards. It looks for ingredients, instructions, and notes by identifying list items, paragraphs, or elements labeled with common recipe keywords like “ingredient” or “instruction.” The extracted recipe is then displayed in a simple, clean format that you can easily copy, save, or print.  \n\nThis extension is perfect for home cooks, meal planners, or anyone who wants to grab a recipe without the hassle of scrolling through ads or lengthy stories. Print My Recipe is lightweight, fast, and user-friendly. Just click the extension icon while viewing a recipe page, and let it do the work for you. If there’s a print button, it’s triggered instantly. If not, the clean recipe is extracted for you automatically. No distractions, no ads—just the recipe you need.  \n\nPrint My Recipe focuses on what matters most: getting you a clean, ad-free version of any recipe as quickly as possible. It’s a must-have tool for anyone who cooks, saves recipes, or plans meals. Click, print, and cook without frustration."
