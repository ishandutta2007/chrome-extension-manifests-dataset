The Greenpeace Links Chrome extension allows a quick option to use the links and redirect directly in the browser by entering the \"gp/<link>\" short option.\n\nThese shortened links often redirect the users to the original, long URL via the Greenpeace Links shortener app, and this is very useful to use setting up short links to internal systems by shortening their name.\n\nTO give an example - assuming the short links are setup, you can, for instance, access the internal mail system from the browser with \"gp/mail\", or you could access the intranet with \"gp/intra\" - the benefits are the time savings in remembering short name than long URLs."
