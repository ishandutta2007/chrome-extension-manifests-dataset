OVER 10 MILLION TOTAL INSTALLS! Join OVER ONE MILLION happy WEEKLY ACTIVE users! Boost your volume up to 1000%!\n\nUnleash the power of sound, no matter what speakers or headphones you're using. I made this extension so I could blast music on my laptop. Pick how much louder you want the sound to be on audio from any chrome tab. This will work on any audio coming from any tab, and has been successfully tested on both Mac and Windows. This will work on one tab at a time, so please press the \"turn off\" button before you turn on Volume Booster on a new tab.\n\nIf you are on Windows and are having issues with Fullscreen, press F11.\nIf you are on Mac, maximize the window and then press cmd+shift+F.\n\nIf using earphones or small laptop speakers, moving the slider past the 1/4 of the slider will lead to crackling noise.\n\nI am not responsible for any damage done to your speakers/earphones. Please use this extension with care, especially with moving the slider to the red section.\n\nTRUSTED BY MILLIONS OF ACTIVE USERS\nALWAYS FREE TO USE\nNO ADS! NO MALWARE!"
