Charts can be hidden to remove 3D GPU overhead when not being used.\n\n- Addition of PPD Total at top of screen for multi-slot users to be able to gauge performance of all slots at a glance.\n\n- UI Layout changes to hardware folding slot layout to provide detailed information at a glance for each slot without the need to click the slot to view PPD, points etc.\n\n- Friendly names applied to folding slots for GPUs and CPUs.\n\n- GPUs current performance is shown via indicator on PPD score showing the +/- percent of the current PPD over the average baseline.  Positive values show green, negative red for at a glance monitoring.\n\n- General CSS updates and optimizations\n\n- General JavaScript optimizations \n\n\nVersion 1.1.1 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\n\nNew Feature -  No sleep mode and animation toggle states will be persistent, with storage of the variables held in the extension itself.  This will return the plug-in to it's last known state after browser updates, page refreshes etc.\n\n\nVersion 1.1.0 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\n\nFix - Case where project description does not match currently displayed GPU comparison WU project ID when in no sleep mode.\n\n\nVersion 1.0.9 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\n\nFix - Case where project description does not match currently running WU project ID when in no sleep mode.\n\n\nVersion 1.0.8 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate – LTT Skin return of optimized animated GIFs alternative based on CSS toggles to reduce browser 3D rendering overhead allocating more GPU resources for folding.\n\nUpdate - LTT Skin option to disable animation in extension modes\n\nUpdate - No sleep mode no longer forces page reload, updates current window in place.\n\nFix - Green border around folding icon / animation, CSS values changes to suppress, should fix most instances of users with screen scaling.\n\n\nVersion 1.0.7 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate – LTT Skin removal of animated GIFs to reduce browser 3D rendering overhead allocating more GPU resources for folding\n\n\nVersion 1.0.6 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\n\nFix - GPU performance data displayed on fresh load when \"Finishing\" a WU\n\nUpdate – LTT Skin style and image updates\n\n\nVersion 1.0.5 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate – LTT Skin style and image updates (the folding shirt lives on)\n\nUpdate – Add the number of work unit samples for your GPU and current WU that are being used to calculate the performance score.\n\nUpdate – Add the overall rank of your GPU compared to all others in the database\n\nFix – Change logic for displaying GPU performance to hides cases where you see double notifications on new GPU/WU combinations added in real-time.\n\n\nVersion 1.0.4 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\nUpdate – Add operating system identification when submitting work units to allow for implementation of more accurate PPD averages based on Windows, Linux and OSX driver and OS overhead differences\n\n\nVersion 1.0.3 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\nFix – Address blank GPU on comparison display on pause / restart in clean session condition.\nUpdate – CSS styles and share icons to header area\nUpdate – CSS styles to sleep mode area, addition of disable sleep mode URL in status area\n\n\nVersion 1.0.2 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\nFix – Reduction of URLs required in permissions that apply styles\nFix – Make GPU stats recall and profile URL more distinct for GPUs that register with the same common name in the F@H GPU list\n\n\nVersion 1.0.1 – Beta Updates & Patches\n---------------------------------------------\nFix - support for incognito windows\nFix - support/testing for latest build of Linux Mint 19.3\nFix - client will now load first in client.foldingathome.org wrapper so they can still provide / users see client update notices before the extension loads the custom interface in the iframe.\nFix - extension only breaks out into its own window when extension modes are used.\nAdd - links to LTT Folding forum\nAdd - user stats link to folding.extremeoverclocking.com in points area\nAdd - LTT forum badge level icons to PPD level indicator (Team LTT Only)\nAdd - Direct link to LTT badge request forum thread (Team LTT Only)\nAdd - muted share icons to better fit in with dark theme brightness\nAdd - client information details in panel footer\nAdd - extension modes and no sleep toggle link to panel footer\n\nVersion 1.0.0 – Beta Release\n---------------------------------------------\nInitial launch version."
