It usually takes minutes to add a website to the pool.\n\nThis extension enables browser to ignore Same Origin restriction in HTTP headers when embedding third party web application in an iframe of search.seenami.com as long as the it is under the search.seenami.com browser tab. The extension does not impact any web applications under the tabs other than search.seenami.com tab.\n\nAlso the extension relays traffic from search.seenami.com application to the web application embedded in the iframe of the search.seenami.com web application and executes the scripts generated in search.seenami.com on the web application embedded in the iframe and returns the results to search.seenami.com web application for further processing.\n\nEmphasis: All of above functions have to be under the search.seenami.com tab, no other tabs on the same browser are affected."
