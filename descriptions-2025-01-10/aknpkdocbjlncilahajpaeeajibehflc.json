So, AmericanSearches conveniently displays search results from BOTH Left-Leaning and Right-Leaning news sources in unobtrusive sidebars with conventional Google search results displayed in between.  \n\n\nHow do I use it?\n--------------------------\nAmerican Searches is a Google Chrome web browser extension.  Click on the blue button above to ‘Add to Chrome’ (if you’re already using a Chrome web browser) or ‘Available on Chrome’ (if you’re using a different web browser, such as Microsoft Edge or Explorer) to install American Searches on your computer.  Once it is installed, simply click on the American Searches icon in the upper right corner of your Google Chrome browser to get started (it will look like a small circle with an American flag).  Go to Google.com, type any search term and American Searches Left/Right sidebars and sources will automatically appear alongside your normal Google search results.\n\n\nDo I have to pay to use it?\n-----------------------------------------\nNo, American Searches is provided as a free Public Service for those who are interested in preserving convenient access to – and awareness of – BOTH sides of every story or current event. \n\n\nHow does it work?\n------------------------------\nAmerican Searches simply displays the most relevant search results (a summary list of titles and sources) from Left-Leaning sources in a blue sidebar window to the left of conventional Google search results, along with the most relevant search results from Right-Leaning sources in a red sidebar window on the other side.  Summary results in each Left/Right sidebar contain ‘clickable’ links that you can explore at your leisure.  You can also minimize or maximize one or both sidebars/tabs as needed.\n\nContact Us:\n-------------------\nSupport@AmericanSearches.com"
