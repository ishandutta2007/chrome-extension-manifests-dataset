ATAAPS lacks some of the features modern web applications have, like autocomplete and search features.\n2. While ATAAPS has a feature to automatically fill out your timecard every paid period some organizations either don't do it, or want to do it.\n3. But lastly this is made because I can (well I wanted to see if I could.)\n\nFirst time setup:\nTo allow the extension to get the ATAAPS options\n- Go to to the labor page and add a new row (this pull the options for schedule templates)\n- ATAAPS Menu => Labor => insert row\n\nTo get the leave request options\n- Go to the create new leave request window (that's it)\n- ATAAPS Menu => Leave Request => New Leave Request\n\nVerifying data\n- To verified that ATAAPS data has been loaded, click on the extension icon and then click on \"show data\""
