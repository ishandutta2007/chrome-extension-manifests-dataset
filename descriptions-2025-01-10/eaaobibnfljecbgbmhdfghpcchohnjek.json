Even if your content is English, you can significantly improve the experience of such users by ensuring that pages and sites you link to will display in their preferred language.\n\nMany web sites can detect and serve content in the preferred language of a visitor. This obviously requires the web site to be localized and less obviously that links to that site do not \"force\" a specific language by passing language as URL parameter, and instead use \"language neutral URLs\".\n \nThis extension allows you to visually review a web page by highlighting links with different colors, according to what a non-English user is likely to experience when they follow that link. \n\nIt will highlight links on a page as follows:\n- Hardcoded English - The URL of the link has a hardcoded 'en-us' language code.\n- Known unlocalized site - The link goes to a site known to lack localization.\n- Known localized site - The link goes to a site that can typically detect and provide the visitor's prefered language.\n- Redirection - The URL of the link is a redirection service. \n- Other - Other sites\n\nHistory:\n1.0.1: Adds highlights for \"safelink\" URLs. Red highlight are easier to see. Extra sites recognized as not localized. Fixed icon issue."
