It might work on a browser on desktop but have issues in the same browser on mobile.\n\nThe cause of these bugs is usually developers that use features that are not available in all browsers. Volunteers track, troubleshoot even contact the site authors and help them overcome these issues.\n\nIf you ‚ù§Ô∏è the open web, join the community and track web compatibility üêú! Thank you! üåà"
