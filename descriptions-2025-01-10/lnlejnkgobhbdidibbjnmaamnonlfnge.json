It can also hide metrics from all tweets.\n\nThis extension allows you to hide certain types of tweets from most tabs:\n   - Reply tweets\n   - Retweets\n   - GIFs\n   - Videos\n   - Cards (embedded links)\n\nWorks for the home timeline, Media tabs, Likes tabs, Profile tabs and lists. You can also whitelist users or lists you don't want the extension to hide anything for.\n\nIn addition, you can use the Misc configuration options to hide the \"Trending Topics\" and \"Who to Follow\" panes that appear on the right of the Twitter webpage, and to hide the Explore link on the left navigation menu.\n\nNote that the extension will only hide these tweets for you, not for other people viewing your Twitter profile (unless they have installed the extension as well). If you want e.g. something that hides all GIFs from your media tab for all Twitter users, the extension is not able to do that; it can only hide tweets for you in your browser.\n\nVersion 1.8 changelog:\n\n- Modified the main scripts to run on both twitter.com and x.com, as twitter.com links are being forcibly redirected to x.com recently, breaking script functionality.\n\nVersion 1.7 changelog:\n\n- Added option to hide the Grok tab in the Advanced Options -> Misc area.\n- Fixed a bug where the saved settings for removing sensitive timeline overlays was not properly reflected in the options checkbox.\n\nVersion 1.6 changelog:\n\n- Added an option to remove all sensitive content overlays, in the Advanced Options -> Misc area.\n\nVersion 1.5 changelog:\n\n- Metrics can now be hidden from all tweets. The options for this can be found under Advanced Options -> Metrics.\n\nVersion 1.4 changelog:\n\n- Added options to hide the \"Who to Follow\" pane from the right of the Twitter page, and the Explore link in the left navigation menu. These options can be found under Advanced Options -> Misc.\n\nVersion 1.3 changelog:\n\n- Added the option to hide the \"What's happening\" / \"Trending topics\" pane from the top right of the Twitter page. This option can be found under Advanced Options -> Misc. Additional options will come in future updates."
