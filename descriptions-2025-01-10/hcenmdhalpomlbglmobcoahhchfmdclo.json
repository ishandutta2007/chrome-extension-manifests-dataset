Simply highlight two numbers & it magically calculates the percentage difference. Automatically loading it into your clipboard.\n\nThe 1st number that's highlighted by double clicking or dragging is stored as the \"old\" value.\nThe 2nd number highlighted is stored as the \"new\" value.\n\nAs soon as you highlight the 2nd number, this extension automatically calculates the percentage difference between the two & loads the answer into your clipboard for easy pasting. \n\nFAQ\n\n* How do I reset the numbers?\nHighlight new numbers, it should automatically calculate again. If that doesn't work, hit the X in the banner. This will wipe the memory of the values stored. \n\n* Are international number formatting supported?\nYes, whether you use commas or periods to break up large numbers it should work. \n\n* Does it support highlighting 1k or 1m?\nYes, it supports k, m, b, t shorthand for percentage differences. \n\n* Does it calculate values across tabs?\nNot right now. It only works for values within the same tab. If people would like to see that functionality, let us know!\n\n* How is it calculated?\nPercentage change is calculated by dividing the change in value by the absolute value of the original value and multiplying by 100.\n\nPercentage Change = ΔV / |V1| × 100 = (V2 − V1) / |V1| × 100\n\nWhere:\nV1 = Original value\nV2 = New value\nΔV = Change in value (V2 − V1)\n\nThis formula expresses the proportional change between two values as a percentage."
