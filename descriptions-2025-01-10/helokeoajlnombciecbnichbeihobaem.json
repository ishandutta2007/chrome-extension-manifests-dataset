One player has the dark pieces (usually black); the other has the light pieces (usually white or red). Players alternate turns. A player can not move an opponent's pieces. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.\n\n\nCONTACT\nPlease feel free to contact us at: https://www.w3technic.com/contact\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nRead at: https://www.w3technic.com/privacy-policy\n\nUSER'S REVIEWS\n....\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\nv1.0.0\n- First release"
