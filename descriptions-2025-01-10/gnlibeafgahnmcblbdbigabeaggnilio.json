In order to use this extension, you must be a While1 While1 Voice customer.\n \nThis plugin automatically opens a Screen Pop in Chrome Browser in Customer's (private) CRM for every incoming call.\n \nThe extension DOES NOT gather any data nor from the User (the While1 Voice Customer's Employee), neither from other Data Subject. The extension stores in user's browser (locally) the username and the While1 Voice PBX hostname.\n \nInformation we process:\nThe extension receives from While1 PBX Server only one parameter: an URL to a private app, in order to open a Screen Pop in Customerâ€™s own private CRM / ERP.\n\nThe URL syntax could contain data recognised as a PII (personally identifying information), eg. incoming phone number of a data subject or it could contain encrypted data exclusively, depending on how the While1 Customer decides to provide the necessary URL in order to use this plugin.\n \nWhile1 Voice Notifier functionality falls under the obligation of the mandatory Data Processing Agreement signed with the While1 While1 Voice Customer.\n\nMoreover, While1 Voice Notifier functionality is complying with While1 Voice Privacy Policy in its capacity as SaaS developer and Data Processor."
