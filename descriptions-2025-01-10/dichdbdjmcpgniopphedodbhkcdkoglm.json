It analyzes the ads you receive in Facebook and shows you what attributes Facebook has inferred about you, what attributes advertisers use to target you, and much much more.\n\nIt works silently in the background while you are browsing Facebook without any overhead to your browsing experience.\n\n\nWarning! If you are using some ad blocker like AdBlock Plus, you need to disable it on Facebook in order to get the most out of AdAnalyst. Also, you need to set your language in Facebook to English (US) or French (France). Currently, we do not support other languages."
