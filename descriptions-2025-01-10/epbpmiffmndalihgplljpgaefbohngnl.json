By default, the Chrome history UI only shows you one page of results at a time, and you have to manually keep deleting all the results. This extension automatically deletes history in batches of 100 (max allowed by Chrome search) until there are no results left.\n\nThis extension is completely open source and is less than 100 lines of code:\nhttps://github.com/raoneel/history_deleter"
