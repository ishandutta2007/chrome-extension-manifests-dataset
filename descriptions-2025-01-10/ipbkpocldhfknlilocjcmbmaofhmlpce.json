Because Quora uses a lot of JavaScript to insert posts after initial page load, this extension takes some time to detect and remove extraneous posts. It may take several seconds to work fully, depending on the size of a given thread.\n\nReporting issues / Requesting features:\nPlease reach out via email with any questions or concerns regarding this extension."
