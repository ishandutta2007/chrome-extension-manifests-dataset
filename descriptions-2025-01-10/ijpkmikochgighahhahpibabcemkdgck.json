This extension solves that by adding download buttons to videos that are missing it, making it easier than ever to survive the next Ilias outage.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/McLP2/Ilias-Video-Download-Button\n\nIf you want to try this add-on but do not have access to an instance of ILIAS with Opencast, you can host your own. You can find information about this process at https://www.ilias.de/ and https://opencast.org/, especially at https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_4975_1357.html."
