I created this because bookmarklets are more trouble than they're worth on Chrome, including the need to keep the bookmarks bar visible, and even if that weren't objectionable, each group would need their own bookmarklet because of the way ELGG works.\n\nAfter installing, right click on the Landing icon and go to Options to save your Landing username.\n\nThis extension is not officially supported by or endorsed by Athabasca University."
