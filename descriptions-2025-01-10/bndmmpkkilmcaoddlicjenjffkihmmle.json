Works with all language audio tracks, closed captioning, and all of the available video streams.\n\nControls:\n- [space]: pause / play the video\n- m: mute / unmute the video\n- [up arrow] / [down arrow]: increment / decrement the volume by 5%\n- [left arrow] / [right arrow]: backward / forward by 5 seconds\n- j / l: backward / forward by 10 seconds\n- f: fullscreen\n- [1]...[9]: skip to 10%...90% of the video\n- [home]: seek to the start of video\n- [end]: seek to the end of the video\n- [s]: synchronize timestamps between video feeds in different tabs\n\nRelease Notes for 0.4.4\n- Fixes tab sync\n\nFAQ / Troubleshooting:\n\nI've got the extension. How do I cast?\nRight click on the video and click 'Cast media to device'\n\nWhen I cast, it just mirrors my screen instead of casting the video. How can I fix this?\nYour Google Cast device needs to pull the new config that supports the Google Cast receiver for F1 TV. Power cycle / reboot your Cast device and it should pick up the F1 TV Cast Receiver\n\nI see a blank screen that says F1 TV (Unofficial) but the video does not load. How can I fix this?\nThe authentication token for the stream expired. To renew it, click on one of the other video tracks (like a driver stream) and then click back to the video track you were watching.\n\nAdditional information + support at https://github.com/outlandnish/ext-f1-tv"
