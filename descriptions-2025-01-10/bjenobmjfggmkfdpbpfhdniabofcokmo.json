Next.js will display the error message along with the line number, but finding the correct file among hundreds can be a challenge. This is where Talaria comes in.\n\nWhen the extension detects an error on the page, it lists it in the popup. You can then click on the error, and the extension will open Visual Studio Code, take you to the correct file, and jump to the line with the error. This feature saves you time and helps you quickly address issues in your code, streamlining your debugging process during local development.\n\nTalaria Client(the chrome extension) needs to work with the server(the vscode extension) which you can download from here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sylvestersarpong.talaria-server"
