Data held in protected 'bubbles' can be accessed by applications authorised to act on behalf of your Bubble ID.  Web pages designed to use Bubble Pass do not need a back-end server to provide authentication, restrict content for specific users or store user account data. Web developers can instead upload content to a bubble, specify custom access controls in a smart contract and let users authenticate with their Bubble ID to access the content.  Bubble Pass manages the authentication process and all the platform calls so that developers can include protected content in their web page with just a single line of code.\n\nBubbles can be used with Bubble Pass to:\n- replace user accounts\n- limit private content to the owner of an NFT\n- limit access to registered members of a site\n- implement private file sharing\n- much more...\n\nNB: This version is experimental and runs on the Bubble Test Net.  We'd love to hear what you are doing with this technology so please reach out and let us know."
