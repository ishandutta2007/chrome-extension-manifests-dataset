Enjoy this thrilling game without the need for an internet connection.\n\nPaper.io is a highly addictive multiplayer game where your goal is to capture as much territory as possible. In this version, you can enjoy the game without distractions, competing against AI opponents.\n\nIn Paper.io, you control a square that leaves a colored trail as it moves. The aim is to expand your territory by enclosing areas and returning to your base. However, you need to be careful—if another player crosses your trail before you close the loop, you'll be eliminated. Likewise, you can eliminate opponents by crossing their trails. The game becomes more challenging as the map gets crowded, and you'll need to outsmart your rivals to dominate the board.\n\nInstructions:\n\nUse the arrow keys to control your square and claim territory by surrounding areas with your trail."
