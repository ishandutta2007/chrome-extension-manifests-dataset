When solving algorithm challenges, sometimes knowing how difficult a problem is by its label can impact performance. Knowing a problem is \"Easy\" and then struggling to solve it can reduce confidence; knowing a problem is \"Hard\" may lead to prematurely giving up. Hiding the difficulty makes problem solving similar to live interviews where candidates are given problems completely blind to how difficult a problem is rated.\n\nUsers can obfuscate Easy/Medium problems, Medium/Hard problems, or choose to hide all difficulties. Users can also choose to reveal the difficulty of a problem once it is solved and hide problems' acceptance rates. \n\nWith this extension, you can solve problems blindly and practice your algorithm skills without mental blockers!\n\nLeetCode's client is built with React. This extension uses DOM APIs on React's Virtual DOM which may mean the extension will not work perfectly at times. If the class names on the website change, that will also cause problems. Please raise any issues you encounter on GitHub."
