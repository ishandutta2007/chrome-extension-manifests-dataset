If the icon is grey then you haven't logged into Yammer.\n\nClicking on the icon will take you to the Yammer website.\n\nDesktop notifications are displayed for each new message using Chrome's notification system. You can set a limit on how many notifications come up.\n\nBased on code from Cain, with permission (thanks!). See the source code repository for complete history. If you have any problems with the extension, please follow the Support link to log an issue. Thanks."
