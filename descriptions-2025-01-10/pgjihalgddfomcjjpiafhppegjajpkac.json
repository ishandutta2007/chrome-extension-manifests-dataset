Those processes are replaced with a single keyboard shortcut instead.\n\nHOW TO USE:\n\n1. Head to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in the browser and set the keyboard shortcut you'd like to use.\n2. On any WordPress site, hit that keyboard shortcut to log into and switch to/from the WordPress admin.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n1. You're not yet logged in to a WordPress site. Hitting the shortcut will direct you to the WordPress admin login screen. After logging in you will be directed to the admin post edit screen for the post/page/custom post type you were viewing before you logged in, if possible, or else the main admin screen.\n\n2. You're logged in and are on the front end of a WordPress site. Hitting the shortcut will direct you to the Admin post edit screen for the post/page/custom post type you were viewing, or else the main Admin screen.\n\n3. You're logged in and are in the WordPress Admin. Hitting the shortcut will direct you to the page on the front end for the post/page/custom post type you were editing, or else the main site URL.\n\nFAQ:\n\n> How do I set the keyboard shortcut?\n\nGo to the Chrome \"Keyboard shortcuts\" page by navigating to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in a browser tab. Find the \"WordPress Admin Switcher\" extension on the list click the field next to \"Switch to/from admin\". Enter your own custom keyboard shortcut.\n\n> If I'm logged in to a site, WordPress provides links in the admin bar at the top that can be used to jump back & forth between the admin and front end. How is this any different?\n\nIt's about efficiency and productivity. The more you can leave your hands on the keyboard without reaching for the mouse/trackpad, the faster you'll be. Not to mention that if you're not yet logged in to a WordPress site, the admin bar links aren't there for you to click on so you'll end up manually highlighting and deleting part of the URL and typing in \"wp-admin\" every time."
