This tool can be particularly useful for users who follow a large number of accounts and want to clean up their following list quickly and efficiently.\n\nHow to Use\nLog in to TikTok: Navigate to the TikTok website and log into your account.\n\nOpen 'Following' List: Click on your profile image in the top right corner of the TikTok homepage. In the dropdown menu that appears, click 'View profile'. On your profile page, click on the 'Following' number to open a popup window that displays all the accounts you're currently following.\n\nClick 'Unfollow All' Button: In the 'Following' popup window, you'll see a red button labeled 'Unfollow All' at the top of the list of accounts you're following. Click this button to start the process of unfollowing all accounts.\n\nWait for the Process to Complete: The extension will start clicking the 'Unfollow' button for each account one by one. This process may take a while if you're following a large number of accounts. Please be patient and avoid navigating away from the page until all accounts have been unfollowed.\n\nChange Delay\nIn the settings of the extensions you can change the delay, after changing the delay make sure to refresh the page for it to take effect.\n\nPlease remember to use this extension responsibly. Unfollowing a large number of accounts in a short period of time may be seen as spammy behavior by TikTok and may result in your account being temporarily or permanently suspended. Always respect the terms of service of the platform and the privacy of other users when using tools like this."
