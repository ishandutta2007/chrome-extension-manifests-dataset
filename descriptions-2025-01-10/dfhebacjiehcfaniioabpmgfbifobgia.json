The keyboard allows for the use of special characters found in the orthography chosen by Red Cloud Indian School for representing the Lakota language.  The keyboard relies on the use of a \"dead-key\" character, which allows special characters, such as š or ȟ to be formed while allowing full use of the regular English keyboard.  \n\nThe ^ key (Shift+6) is used as the dead-key for entering special characters.  By pressing Shift+6, followed by the letter 's', an š character is formed.  Shift+6, followed by an 'n' produces the ŋ character."
