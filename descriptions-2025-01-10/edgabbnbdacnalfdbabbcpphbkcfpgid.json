Portal lets you embed your favorite day-to-day websites in New Tab. You can also adjust the size and position of the website easily. So when you want a specific breakpoint of a website, you don't have exit full screen to minimize your window anymore. It's like a design tool but you are drawing & embedding live websites.\n\nNotes\n- Portal is safe to use and doesn't collect any user data.\n- Portal overrides some network requests to embed a live website in a safer way using declarativeNetRequest.\n- Portal ensures the network requests are overridden only in the new tab(empty url page) and doesn't effect your other web pages.\n- Although Portal overrides network requests, some websites use javascript to detect if it's embedded. Portal may not work well with those websites."
