With just one click, the extension automatically scrapes candidate data from popular job portals such as Naukri.com, LinkedIn, Cutshort.io, and others, and adds them to the \"Rekruit.it\" platform for easy access and management.\n\nOnce installed, the extension integrates seamlessly with your browser and displays a small icon on the toolbar. To use the extension, simply navigate to the job portal of your choice and search for candidates as usual. When you find a potential candidate, click the \"Rekruit.it\" icon to initiate the scraping process. The extension will automatically collect relevant candidate data, including their name, contact information, education, work experience, and other relevant details.\n\nThe collected data is then organised into a comprehensive candidate profile within the \"Rekruit.it\" platform. From there, you can easily review, manage, and communicate with candidates directly from the platform. You can also use the platform to track candidate progress throughout the recruitment process, schedule interviews, and collaborate with team members.\n\nThe \"Rekruit.it\" chrome extension is the perfect tool for recruiters and hiring managers who want to streamline their recruitment process and save time. With its easy-to-use interface and powerful data collection capabilities, the extension makes it easy to find and manage top talent from multiple job portals in one convenient location."
