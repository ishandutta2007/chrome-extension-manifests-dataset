It’s nonintrusive and fully private. When you activate it your tabs are sorted based on the duration you are actively viewing it combined with the total time you actively browse pages on that domain. It will allow you to discover greater insights about your browsing habits.\n\nRelevance will keep track of the pages you actually read, and how long you spend reading them. This information is kept completely private, on your local browser. As you open tabs, its knowledge of what's important to you grows, and when you activate it the tabs  for your current window are ordered depending on how long you have spent reading them.\n\nThis creates a natural arrangement where the tabs you have spent the longest on, which are expected to be the most relevant, are placed first, and the ones you haven't read at all are shunted to the end.\n\nI wrote *Relevance* to help me manage the huge mess of tabs you end up with after a while of browsing, like doing a web search and opening tabs for a lot of results.\n\nThis version of Relevance has an experimental integration with StartPage. After you run a search, it'll look at the results on your current page and re-prioritize the links shown to bring to the front those you have spent the longest reading."
