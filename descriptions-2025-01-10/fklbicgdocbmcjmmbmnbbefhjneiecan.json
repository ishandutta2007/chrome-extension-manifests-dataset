For details and the stable (GA) app, please see https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hcihcignkpajeehfnomlncinacagapdf\nI'm planning to make releases to this app a few weeks earlier than the GA app. If things don't work, I'm counting on your bug reports to help keep those defects out of GA.  You can contact me via \"Visit Support Hub\", then either \"contact the developer,\" or the \"developer's support site\" link + \"new issue' button if you have a GitHub account.\n\nWhat's new in the beta 1.8.0\n- Save options between sessions and use them for context menu options. (Adds \"storage\" permission requirement)\n- Ported to Typescript to catch bugs sooner\n- New option \"deduplicate\": when set, only opens one tab for identical links in the selection\n- New option: \"focus\": when set, make the opened tab active or give the opened window focus. (Note: When unset, new windows may be drawn on top without being given focus, which can be confusing)\n- Command and menu item handlers share code.\n- Content script is persistent (more reliable)\n- Better error handling in the popup\n- Unit tests!\n\nWhen viewing a page containing a list of links you want to open, such as a list of references in Wikipedia or a paper, it's convenient to be able to open them all at once rather than opening and dragging one at a time."
