This means you can browse Instagram, play poker, or use Tinder with LicenceOne installed, and we won't track or report these activities to your employer (and we won’t stock and use them ourselves either, of course).\n\n----\n\n❓Can my employer see how often I log into an application, or how long I spend on an application?\n\n👉 No. LicenceOne only ever tracks and displays the last date (not time) that you logged into an application.\n\nThey will also get notified if you haven’t logged into a paid business application for 30 or more days. That way, they know to check if you still require a paid seat or not.\n\n----\n\n❓Can I see a list of the business applications that LicenceOne tracks?\n\n👉 Unfortunately not. As our database of software subscriptions is one of the largest in the industry, we really want to keep it away from any would-be competitors with a scraping tool.\n\nHowever, once you install the extension, LicenceOne will display all the applications that we’ve tracked for your user profile. You can see this by clicking on the extension icon on your browser.\n________\n\nWebsite: https://www.licence.one/\nFAQ: https://faq.licence.one/\nSupport: help@licenceone.com"
