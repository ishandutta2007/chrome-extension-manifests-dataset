Is work or school preventing you from staying up? Want to browse Reddit in the meantime? Spoilers in titles are a pain, but with potentially dozens of posts on the same topic, having to guess the keywords they might use with a conventional feed blocker can be a pain in itself.\n\nThis Reddit feed blocker blocks content from subreddits before or after a given time and date, enabling you to browse your favorite subreddits without fear of spoilers.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Compatibility with Old and New Reddit\n- Support for many types of feeds—home, popular, all, search, individual subreddits\n- Support for multiple filters at the same time\n- Ability to toggle filters on and off at will\n- Ability to choose precise times and dates, down to the exact minute\n\nNOTE:\nReddit Spoiler Avoider may ask for permission to read and change your data on Reddit websites. The sole purpose of this is to block posts on the pages — we do not collect personal information, browsing history, or any other type of sensitive data.\n\nVersion 0.0.3\n- Added support for search and comment feeds for New Reddit\n- Fixed bug where later posts would not be filtered out\n- Fixed bug where filters would not be applied when navigating to a subreddit using the sidebar"
