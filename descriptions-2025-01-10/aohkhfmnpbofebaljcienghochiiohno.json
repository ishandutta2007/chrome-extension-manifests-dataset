This gives power to the botnet owners to promote content they choose on X. It's best not to have any of these bots in your followers.\n\nUsage:\n- Navigate to your followers list, usually at \"https://x.com/YOUR_USERNAME/followers\"\n- Open the X Bot Remover extension.\n- Review parameters, by default it will remove all followers (suspected bots) with:\n    - Less than 50 followers themselves\n    - Following more than 1000\n    - Have 0 posts (i.e. zero posting activity - you might want to increase this slightly)\n- Make sure your \"Messages\" panel is minimised before you start the process, otherwise it will interfere with the automation.\n\nMore information at: https://vanderwalt.de/blog/x-bot-remover\n\nChange list:\n- Added a \"Nr of digits in username >=\" rule - will remove followers with names like \"Karen1234567\"\n- Improved follower processing logic resulting in significant speedup.\n- Added a \"Skip number of followers\" input, so that you can resume a bot removal session from deeper into your follower list. This is useful if you have a large number of followers.\n- Bug fix on follower processing error"
