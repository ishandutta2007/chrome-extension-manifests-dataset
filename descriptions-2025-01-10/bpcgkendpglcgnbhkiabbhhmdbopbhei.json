This extension hides tweets that share the same content as a tweet you've already seen in your feed.\n\nOneTweet tries to recognize that \"10 ways to say I love you\" and \"10 Ways to say I love U\" are semantically the same; but there is still room for improvement.\n\nThe extension works in the background, and only has permissions to look at Twitter pages. \nNone of your data is persisted in any form.\n    \nIf you appreciate my work and want more features developed consider grabbing me a coffee at www.buymeacoffee.com/giladamar.\n   \nFeatures in development:\n    * A config menu where you can:\n      * De/activate console.logs that inform you of silenced tweets.\n      * Add exceptions to the rules.\n      * Block duplicate tweets ONLY from the same handle or for all tweets.\n    * A button to quickly activate or deactivate the extension.\n    * Improve recognition of two slightly different tweets really having the same content, and blocking the one accordingly."
