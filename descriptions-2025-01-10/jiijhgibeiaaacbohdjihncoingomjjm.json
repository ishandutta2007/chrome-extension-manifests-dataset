Only applies to the LinusTechTips channels, because they are the only Floatplane/Twitch channels where the WAN show is live-streamed.\n\nIt only replaces the \"offline\" box, so as soon as any livestream starts, the whenplane widget will be removed, and the livestream will play like normal.\n\nThis addon also adds a search provider, which means you can search something using The WAN Show Search faster. Type @wan into the url bar to do this. You might need to enable this in your browser's settings.\n\nThe addon also has a few other features, including a \"Show Info\" box on WAN Show VODs on Youtube and Floatplane, and a Floatplane \"Live Status\" box, which will allow you to see how long they have been live.\n\nAll features other than the main offline player widget are optional and can be disabled by clicking on the extension's icon."
