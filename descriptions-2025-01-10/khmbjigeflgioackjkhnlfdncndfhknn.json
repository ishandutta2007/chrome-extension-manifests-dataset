This is typically due to each tabs memory usage and any scripts running on those pages. \n\nThis extension puts the tabs in a minimal memory and almost zero cpu usage state. What makes this tab different than others similar to it is that you can easily recover back from idle by either clicking a simple link or using the browser back button."
