'Go Outside' presents a simple yet stark reminder each time a new tab is opened of a different customised activities you could be doing instead of mindlessly browsing the web looking at yet another cat video or scrolling yet another newsfeed.\n\nNew in 1.2.0: Chrome Extension will now work in an incognito tab, if the extension is enabled to work in incognito.\nNew in 1.1.0: Firefox plugin compatability and open the options page on first use."
