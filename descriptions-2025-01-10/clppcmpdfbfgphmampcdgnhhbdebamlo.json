Due to security restrictions it's not possible to load \"chrome://theme/IDR_THEME_NTP_BACKGROUND\" as a wallpaper. You need to save your theme wallpaper manually and then specify it via \"Choose File\" button.\n2. Do not expect sweetly decorated settings page or anything else in addition. My goal was just to replace the standard new tab page so I didn't bother with a \"nice and smooth user friendly interface\".\n3. You can freely edit this extension and make your own analogue with better functionality. I'll be only pleased if you send me a link to your better extension."
