With this extension, you'll be able to set Gmail (or your G Suite account) as your default email client anytime you click on an email address that you find online. \n\nThis extension is great for:\n\n✅ Large organizations that use Google Workspace to ensure that all your employees compose emails from their work emails and not accidentally sent from employees' private email accounts (ie. iCloud, Outloook.com, or other Gmail email).\n\n✅ Gmail users who just don't like using other email clients other than their Gmail email client. \n\n✅ Gmail users who are left wondering why clicking on an email link just never works at all. \n\nSave time from having to copy and paste email addresses from the web into your Gmail compose window with Mailto: Set Default Email to Gmail by cloudHQ\n\ncloudHQ. Helping your productivity, 1 click at a time.\n\n\ncloudHQ website: https://www.cloudhq.net/\nApp website: https://www.gmail-mailto.com\nPricing: https://www.gmail-mailto.com/pricing\nSupport page: https://support.cloudhq.net/category/browser-extensions/gmail-mailto/\nBlog: https://blog.cloudhq.net\nDemo: https://www.cloudhq.net/demo\n\nGoogle Workspace, Google Sheets, Google Drive, Google Alerts and Gmail are trademarks of Google LLC.
