This list of instances is synchronised if you are logged into Chrome (though you need to give permission to the extension on each Chrome instance).\n\nAn incoming CL is considered as requiring attention if you have not given at least +1 to it or if the author added a message to the CL more recently than you.\n\nAn outgoing CL is considered as requiring attention if it has unresolved comments (including yours).\n\nAn outgoing CL is considered stale if there was no comments in the last 24h (except autogenerated comments).\n\nSource code available at https://github.com/sdefresne/gerrit-monitor\n\nNew in version 1.2.5:\n- fix to get the extension working on gerrit instance where star: operator has been removed.\n\nNew in version 1.2.4:\n- add an option to disable \"error\" notifications\n\nNew in version 1.2.3:\n- fix error reporting in badge and popup\n\nNew in version 1.2.2:\n- correctly report authentication errors\n- reduce how long results are cached\n\nSee the extension source code for description of older versions."
