For ChromeOS, Chrome Apps will be supported until at least January 2025⁠⁠.\nPWAs and extensions can communicate bi-directionally using message passing.\nExtensions are deployed through the Chrome Admin Console in the kiosk configuration screen.\nTo receive and respond to messages from PWA, you will need to expose a background script that listens for messages to arrive from the PWA and then proxy those requests to a corresponding API call.\nA computer screen, also known as a monitor or display, is an output device that visually represents the data processed by the computer. It typically consists of a flat panel display, such as an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or LED (Light Emitting Diode) screen, housed within a frame. The screen displays images, text, and videos, allowing users to interact with the computer's graphical user interface (GUI).\nComputer screens come in various sizes, resolutions, and aspect ratios, providing different levels of clarity and detail. Modern screens often support high-definition (HD) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions, offering sharp and vibrant visuals. They may also include features such as adjustable brightness, contrast, and color settings, as well as ergonomic adjustments like tilt, swivel, and height adjustment for user comfort.\nIn addition to standard desktop monitors, computer screens can be integrated into laptops, all-in-one computers, and other portable devices, providing flexibility and convenience for users on the go.\nScreen rotation refers to the ability to change the orientation of the display from landscape (horizontal) to portrait (vertical) and vice versa. This feature is particularly useful for devices such as tablets, smartphones, and certain computer monitors that support different viewing modes.\nIn landscape mode, the screen is wider than it is tall, which is ideal for watching videos, playing games, and working with wide documents or spreadsheets. In portrait mode, the screen is taller than it is wide, making it suitable for reading, browsing the web, and working with documents that benefit from a vertical layout.\nScreen rotation can be achieved through software settings or by physically rotating the device. Many modern devices include sensors that automatically adjust the screen orientation based on how the device is being held. Additionally, operating systems and applications often provide options to manually control screen rotation to suit the user's preferences and needs.\nThe functionality of this extention is to proxy the Google API call chrome.system.display.setDisplayProperties and set property rotation.\nThe display's clockwise rotation in degrees relative to the vertical position. Currently exposed only on ChromeOS. Will be set to 0 on other platforms. A value of -1 will be interpreted as auto-rotate when the device is in a physical tablet state.\nSuitable PWA are those which need to rotate the screen from landscape to portrait and back."
