The extension can be installed from the Chrome Web Store. Instead of opening the CampusLabs website on a separate tab, users can open the extension and it will display a list of upcoming events at DePauw University. This provides a more accessible and convenient alternative to the CampusLabs website.\n\nUsers can discover new opportunities and engage with different student groups and organizations by scrolling through the list of displayed events. To promote diverse student recruitment, events that celebrate diversity and inclusion are highlighted.\n\nFor users to stay informed about campus events and increase participation, users can enable daily notifications for the extension. A notification box will appear daily to remind users to check out the list of upcoming events.\n\nUsers can integrate events into their busy schedules by clicking on the calendar icon and adding events to Google Calendars. This reminds students of upcoming events and ensures they don't miss out on important opportunities. \n\nEach time a new event is updated, a small red icon next to the extension will appear."
