The physics are made to be fun yet accurate, and multiple driving styles are supported. You can brake aggressively and attack the corner, stick to the racing line, or mark up the track with tire marks in a killer drift! If you feel your car is sliding around too much, you can also turn up the traction control.\n\nCurrently, there are eight different cars, all of which feel different when you steer. More will come in future updates. These eight cars differ in weight, downforce, power, and speed, and all give you a unique experience. There are cars we can only dream of driving in our lives, and cars that you might have already ridden in.\n\nThe game has an online leaderboard, where you can record your times and try to beat the best! If that doesn't work for you, the game also records bests for every model and track combination and shows them as ghosts!\n\nWhenever you close the popup, the game saves your progress, so no need to ever worry about having to close in the middle of a lap!\n\nCheck out https://ttr.advayratan.com for more information!"
