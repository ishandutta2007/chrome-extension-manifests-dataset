This seemingly simple tweak makes reading easier and faster because it allows you to transition between lines quickly and effortlessly. Many people are able to read 20% or 30% faster with BeeLine, even on their first try. BeeLine is used by students from grade school to grad school, including at leading schools around the world.\n\nBACKED BY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND NON-PROFIT PARTNERS\n\nIndependent, educator-led research on BeeLine has shown dramatic reading fluency and comprehension gains for students. BeeLine has been adopted by the California Public Library System, Reading Is Fundamental, and Blackboard Ally.\n\nUSE BEELINE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITES\n\nThe BeeLine extension works on millions of news websites and blogs. You can also get our PDF extension, which works on any text-based PDF (available at http://bit.ly/1Fo1hXa), or our iOS extension (http://bit.ly/1xNs76J)\n\nTRY FOR FREE\n\nBeeLine now offers a free mode that lasts forever.
