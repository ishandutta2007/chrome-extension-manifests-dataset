This means no more manual copying and pasting information into a calculator. \n\nThe plugin functions in the following way: \n1. You navigate to a Rightmove listing page and click calculate \n2. The plugin captures the price and scans the listing for the floor-plan (if there is one) \n3. Extracts the text from the floor-plan image and locates the total floor-plan area\n4. Runs a calculation and displays the price per square foot\n5. If the plugin fails to find the area (i.e. the image quality is too poor) or mistakenly picks up the wrong value, you can manually enter the square foot value, which will update the calculation.\n\nA toggle can be used to switch to meters based on user preference, and historic calculations are saved in the plug-in, meaning they do not need to be recalculated. \n\nPlease note that the calculation typically can take anywhere between 2 and 8 seconds, depending on how much text needs to be scanned. For example, larger floor-plans will take longer to produce a result."
