Moreover, you can set triggers to receive notifications whenever a specific condition is met.\n\n- Check your latest emails & set alerts\n- Check if a product is available & set alert when it becomes available\n- Check your online earnings & set alerts \n- Weather, news and everything that you want\n- Import/Export\n- Styling using CSS\n- Live support\n\nSome use cases:\n- Check your email\n- Check for new freelancing jobs and receive alerts\n- Weather, time, etc...\n- Cryptocurrency prices, wallet checker, gas prices, alerts, etc...\n- And many, many other uses that we haven't thought of yet.\n\nHow it all started?\nWe got tired of opening 10 pages whenever we wanted to check what's new (emails, earnings, messages, notifications, etc...), and we decided to have all these information in one page."
