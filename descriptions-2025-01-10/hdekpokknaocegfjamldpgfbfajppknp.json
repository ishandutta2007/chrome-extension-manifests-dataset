You can also add notes about the page. Finally, you can share it to your friends and followers in the community at 4later, who can read these in their feed on the extension (just like an RSS reader) or on the website.\n\nFor creators who publish curated newsletters, this is an interesting tool to also showcase the many, many links they go through to curate that final product."
