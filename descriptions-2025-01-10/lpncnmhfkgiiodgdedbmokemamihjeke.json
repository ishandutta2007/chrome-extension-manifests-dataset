We've built a browser extension that makes creating interactive demos as easy as clicking a button.\n\nOnce the demo is recorded, it’s easy to edit and personalize details like names, emails, logos, images, colors, and company names - no tech skills needed! These demos can be shared directly or integrated into our real-time call assistant, Blueprints.\n\nWith Blueprints, our step-by-step guide feature, you can set up custom demo guides based on what each customer wants to see and share them with the entire sales team. This way, every rep can highlight the features that matter most to each prospect."
