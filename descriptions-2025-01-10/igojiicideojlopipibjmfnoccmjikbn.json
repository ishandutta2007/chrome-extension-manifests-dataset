Moreover, the badge icon tooltip shows a detailed description (badge number break down). There is also an options page where you can adjust few settings including the total number of Gmail accounts that you have; time interval to check your Gmail account and your default Gmail account to open when clicking on the toolbar icon. Please note that this addon only shows unread emails for the \"inbox\" folder. Currently, it does not support labels.\n\nImportant note: Badge Checker for Gmail™ does NOT belong or relate to Google Inc at all. It is an unofficial extension that is developed and maintained independently by its author. Gmail™ is a registered trademark of Google Inc.\n\nTo report bugs, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/badge-checker-for-gmail.html)."
