This straightforward functionality offers several key benefits that enhance the learning and problem-solving experience on LeetCode.\n\nKey Functionality:\nSole Feature - Hiding Difficulty Levels: The extension's only function is to conceal the difficulty rating of each problem, thereby presenting them without any pre-assigned complexity level.\nWhy Install the LeetCode Difficulty Hider?\nEncourages Unbiased Engagement with Problems: Without visible difficulty levels, users are more likely to approach problems based on their learning goals or interest, rather than being influenced by a label. This can lead to tackling a wider variety of problems.\n\nReduces Intimidation and Mental Blocks: Often, a 'Hard' label can intimidate, while an 'Easy' label might lead to complacency. Hiding these labels removes such mental blocks, encouraging users to focus on the problem itself.\n\nFacilitates Deeper Learning: By engaging with problems without preconceived notions about their difficulty, users can deepen their understanding and problem-solving skills, focusing solely on the logic and concepts involved.\n\nSimulates Real-World Scenarios: In real-world coding challenges, especially in interviews, problems aren't labeled by difficulty. Practicing in an environment that mimics this reality can better prepare users for such situations."
