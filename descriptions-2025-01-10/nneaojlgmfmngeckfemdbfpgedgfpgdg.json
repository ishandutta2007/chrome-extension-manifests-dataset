After uploading an x3d file you are able to see your model on a plane, which fluctuates in size, and includes an x, y, z axis. This viewer allows for a more accurate and detailed perspective of a model because it gives you the ability to change coordinates, direction and color of light, and can take snapshots of the model that will automatically download to your computer. \n\nFeatures:\n- Upload multiple x3d files\n- Change position of models\n- Change scene settings"
