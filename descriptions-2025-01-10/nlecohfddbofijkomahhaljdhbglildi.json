But when you finally read these articles, view the videos, etc., you don’t know any more who pointed you to that interesting content. The tweet context is lost.\n\n“Who Tweeted This?” will memorize the external links that you followed in the Twitter web client. On the linked page, there will be an indicator (light blue question mark) in the address bar. Clicking on the icon will show you the original tweet, and you will be able to retweet, favorite or reply to it.\n\nThe extension will not store any data that may be associated with your identity. It doesn’t access your Twitter account. All stored data will be erased when closing the browser."
