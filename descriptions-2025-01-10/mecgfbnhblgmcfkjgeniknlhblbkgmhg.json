Make choosing a movie that much easier! Simply watch a few movies, and then click the extension icon to get recommendations. Works best with users who watch content on Disney+, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime, however Netflix and Hulu are also supported to some extent. This app is still in its infancy, so bear with me, and feel free to reach out at wac.developerOps@gmail.com if you spot any bugs or have suggestions for improvement. \n\n\nPowered by The Movie Database API, but not endorsed by them."
