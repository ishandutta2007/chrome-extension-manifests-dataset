No more ads, related searches, people also ask, multiple links, video previews, thumbnail images, snippets, widgets, etc. Thanks to the Google search options, you can hide something (for example only ads) and keep everything else, or you can hide all the intrusive contents and get just the text-based search results!\n\nThis extension is not supported by Google. It's a safe beta and requires no special permissions. Kindly report any problem or suggestion and please, if you don't like something, please send me an email and do not leave a negative review. I will do my best to help you!"
