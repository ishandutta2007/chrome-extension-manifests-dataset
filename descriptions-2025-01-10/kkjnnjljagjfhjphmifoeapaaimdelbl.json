Up late working on a paper dreaming of games? In lecture? Snag this extension and you have three little games to keep you entertained: a basic shooter, a paddle and ball game, and a sketching pad to grow reminiscent of your TI-83 drawing days.\n\nAnd just as an added bonus, we have a little banner that'll let you know if your internet is connected. Go on, grab the extension. It's party time."
