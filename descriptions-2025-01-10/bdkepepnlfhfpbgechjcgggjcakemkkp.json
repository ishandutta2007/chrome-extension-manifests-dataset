Templating: What is a **prompt template**?\n\nWhen using AI tools like ChatGPT, we often need to perform some `Prompt Engineering` to get useful results more efficiently.\n\nFor example, the following prompt makes ChatGPT to create content about renewable energy sources for high school students:\n\n```\nI want you to act as an educational content creator. Your task is to create engaging and informative content for learning materials such as textbooks, online courses, and lecture notes. My first request is \"Develop a lesson plan on renewable energy sources for high school students.\"\n```\n\nIf we want ChatGPT to create content on economics for college students, we don't need to change the main part of the prompt. Instead, we would only need to replace\n\n\"Develop a lesson plan on electromagnetism for high school students.\" with\n\n\"Develop a lesson plan on macroeconomics for college students.\"\n\nThus, we turn the above prompt into a `Template`:\n\n```\nI want you to act as an educational content creator. Your task is to create engaging and informative content for learning materials such as textbooks, online courses, and lecture notes. My first request is \"{{Your Request}}\"\n```\n\nThis tool will automatically create a named slot based on the `{{...}}` marker. The next time if you want ChatGPT to explain quantum physics to elementary school students, you only need to fill the slot with \"Explain Quantum Physics to me like I am Five.\"\n\nNow Let's say you want ChatGPT to generate content in another languages, we simply need to modify the above template to:\n\n\n```\n...\nMy first request is \"{{Your Request}}\"\n\nReply in {{lang: English|Chinese|French}}\n\n```\n\nThis will result in another template slot that defaults to `English`, and a selector with options for English, Chinese, and French. \n\n2. Organizable: You can create/edit folders to organize your templates, or move the templates/folders around by drag-and-drop.\n\n3. Extendable: You can import prompts from json file, or directly from Github repository. You can export your prompts and share with your friends.\n\n4. Privacy: This is a completely serverless extension – there's no backend server, no data collection, and no analytics. Enjoy your privacy!\n\n5. Multiple languages supported"
