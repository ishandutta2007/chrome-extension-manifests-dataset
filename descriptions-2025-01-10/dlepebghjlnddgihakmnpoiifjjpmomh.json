It is meant to help teachers guide their students through revisions as well as to ensure that students are not just copy/pasting text from AI/LLMs/ChatGPT or other sources.\n\nWith Revision History, you can see:\n\n- How many edits students made to their essays\n- How long they spent writing\n- What snippets they copy/pasted\n- Watch a video replaying the document being written\n\nIt also works with documents submitted to Google Classroom (as long as they were drafted in Google Docs)."
