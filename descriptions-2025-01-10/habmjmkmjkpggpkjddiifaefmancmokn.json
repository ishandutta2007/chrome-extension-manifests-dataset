The extension integrates seamlessly with Schwab's trading platform, providing an intuitive interface for inputting trade details such as ticker symbol, quantity, and buy/sell action. While SchwaBot offers convenience and efficiency, it's important to note that it facilitates automated trading, which carries inherent risks. Users should exercise caution, thoroughly understand their investment strategy, and be aware of the potential for rapid execution of trades across all linked accounts. SchwaBot is not a financial advisor and does not provide investment advice; it's a tool for executing your own informed decisions more efficiently. We strongly encourage users to review our full disclaimer and terms of use before installing and using this extension."
