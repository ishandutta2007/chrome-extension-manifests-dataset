This was made to help UAV/Drone operators log their lost communications and latency events during flight. All you need to do is click the Lost/Regained button to start and pause the timer. Each time you start the timer, an event is added. The timer will show you the total amount of time during the flight that you had no connection, and the events will show you how many individual events of lost comms you had. I have also added in a separate timer with the same functionality for degraded comms or high latency events. Both timers have their own reset buttons.\n\nLastly you can save the information to a simple text document using the save button for archival purposes if required. \n\nIf you like this extension, please support me by clicking the buy me a coffee button, and contributing to my venmo :)"
