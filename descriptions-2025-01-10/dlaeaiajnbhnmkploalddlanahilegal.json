You can listen to the contents of any article on the web as our extension reads to you-- without the distraction of ads or suggested stories that fill the page, and without eye strain in long browsing sessions.\n\n    Simply open the article you want to have read to you, click on the extension in the upper-right corner and click “READ” and both the title and the contents of the article will be read aloud. Our website (and extension) also have the functionality to read a text file that you provide in the same fashion."
