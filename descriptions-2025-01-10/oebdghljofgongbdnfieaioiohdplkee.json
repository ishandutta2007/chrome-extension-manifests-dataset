Avoid bookmark clutter and rediscover pages you told yourself you'd eventually look at -- just not when you're working!\n\nHit \"Later\" to close and store the current tab (which you clearly don't have time to look at now). Hit \"Now\" when you have free time to reopen the oldest tab you've stored. If you want to clear all your stored pages, hit the \"Reset\" button on top. Careful, this is not reversible!\n\nMade with <3 by Chow and Wang"
