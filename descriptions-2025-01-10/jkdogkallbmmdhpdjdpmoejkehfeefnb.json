Personally identifiable information, Personal communications, and Website Content - Meet Transcript records your Google Meet captions, chat messages, and screenshots on your computer and sends them directly to your Google Drive account.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nQuestion: When I enable \"Show screenshot button\" in the Meet Transcript settings page, I get a popup requesting permission to \"read and change all your data on the websites you visit.\" Why does it need access to all sites?\n\nAnswer: The screenshot feature uses the captureVisibleTab API to take screenshots when requested by the user. The API stipulates that either the \"All URLs\" or the \"ActiveTab\" permission is needed. However, the screenshot feature requires the \"All URLs\" permission because a custom button is created within the Google Meet UI for users to click.\n\nRelease Notes\nhttps://thanesh.dev/meet-transcript#release-notes"
