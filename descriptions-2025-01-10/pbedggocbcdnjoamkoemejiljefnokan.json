You will notice the button changes, so that there is a slash through the eye. This lets you know that all comments are hidden, should you ever forget the state of the comments. Press the button again to show all the internal comments again, and note that the eye button reverts to its open state. \n\nNote that this extension will hide ALL internal comments present in a given Google Chrome Tab. Therefore, if you have ten Chrome tabs open, each tab containing one Zendesk ticket, then pressing the hide comments button will hide *only those internal comments present in the active tab*. On the other hand, if you have one Chrome tab open, running Zendesk, and that one instance of Zendesk has ten Zendesk Tabs open within it, then pressing the hide comments button will hide ALL internal comments for every ticket present in that tab."
