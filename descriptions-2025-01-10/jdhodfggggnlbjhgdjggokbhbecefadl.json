Once one of these inputs is provided, you can click on the - Make GIF - button to create the GIF file. Please note that, before making the GIF image, there are a few settings that you can adjust. If you want to save the GIF file to your machine, please click on the - Download - button. The file will be saved to the default download location on your machine. On the top right corner of the UI, there is a reload button to reload the app (in case something goes wrong or an error occurs). Please note that the default size for the GIF image is (300 x 300) pixels, however, you can edit this value from the UI. This app uses an open-source JavaScript library called gifshot (https://yahoo.github.io/gifshot/).\n\nNote: to convert images to GIFs, please add all images at once to the app interface (top-left section). The app does not support adding images one by one. You can either drop all images or press the green plus icon to choose files. You need at least two images to generate a GIF file.\n\nIf you found a bug to report, or have a feature request in mind, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/gif-maker.html)."
