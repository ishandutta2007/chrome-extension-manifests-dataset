Fantastical twists and proportions represent imagination and playfulness and evoke a sense of wonder.\n\nAshley Lukashevsky (she/they) is a mixed Korean-White, Los Angeles (Tongva land) based illustrator and visual artist from Honolulu, Hawaii. Their work focuses on social issues related to abolition, racial justice, mental health and LGBTQIA+ liberation aiming to dismantle oppressive power structures and uplift hope. Ashley believes art can be used as a tool to strengthen social movements, and that we collectively hold the power to speak, paint, and imagine into existence the kind of world we want to live in. Their energetic and lively style has allowed her to collaborate with organizations including the ACLU, Reform LA Jails, Trevor Project, and Red State Access."
