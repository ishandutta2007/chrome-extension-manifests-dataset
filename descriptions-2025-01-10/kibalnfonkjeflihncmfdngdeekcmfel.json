I've built my very own version to make sure this doesn't happen.\n\nSecure and no useless code: No data is being collected what so ever.\n\n########################################\n\nv1.1 - Fixed an issue where an user would switch channel without quitting Twitch, causing the bonus chest to not restart the countdown (original countdown being 5 minutes before appearing). Script will now start after ~8 seconds and will trigger a click every 1 second. This should give just enough time for the stream to load properly."
