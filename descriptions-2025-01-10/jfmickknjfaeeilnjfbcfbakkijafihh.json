Need to take math notes, but can't write in equations fast enough?\n\nThe MathQuill Image Generator allows for fast and easy equation typing with the same syntax as websites like Desmos and Symbolab. After entering your equation, you can do whatever you like with the generated image from dragging it into an online word processor like Google Docs to copying the image or its address to use elsewhere.\nThis extension streamlines your ability to write LaTeX quickly and efficiently and is an essential productivity tool for any student!\n\nFUTURE PLANS:\n• Settings menu for font size, font type, etc\n• Automatically add image to clipboard (no need to drag the image)"
