Once your windows are arranged in your preferred monitors, our extension enables you to save and reload the position of each window in your monitor setup, i.e., if your Viewer window were on your left-hand monitor, it would appear on the same monitor the next time you login to Sirona. The extension can remember your window state for an unlimited number of monitors.\n\nTo install and set up our Chrome Extension, you must have an account on the Sirona Medical Platform. You can use this link here if you need assistance getting the Chrome Extension to work. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSirona Medical is a company that works with Radiologists to improve efficiency in their workflow using Sirona’s software.
