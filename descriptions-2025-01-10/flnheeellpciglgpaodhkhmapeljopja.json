Want to just quickly test a graphQL query? Altair makes this quite easy. You can provide your query and even specify headers to be sent with the request.\n\nAltair comes with a number of useful features including pretty printing your query, linting your query, showing schema docs, providing autocomplete functionality, the ability to set headers for your request, etc.\n\nData is stored so you can continue from where you stopped. The schema docs are also available offline once they have been retrieved."
