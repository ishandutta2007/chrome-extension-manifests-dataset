If you’re in between two different products, simply run the chrome extension on both products to see which one is more likely to give you the results you’re looking for.\nFor the first time ever, we’re using AI to give dermatologist level of feedback on a product you’re considering. We ask you a few questions about yourself (just like a dermatologist would), look at the product you’re considering, and then use our AI model to provide a recommendation score. Got acne and considering a product with isopropyl myristate? DermaSkan will tell you “not recommended.”\n\nDermaSkan is completely FREE to use as many times as you want!"
