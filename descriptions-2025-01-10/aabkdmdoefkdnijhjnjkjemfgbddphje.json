You know you're picking that crap up subliminally no matter how fast you scroll, right? It's making you stupider bit by bit, day by day.\n\nStop harassing your own psyche and get rid of it once and for all. For the low, low price of $0 bucks - that's half a cup of coffee - this extension will remove the Sports and Entertainment sections from your Google News feed forever.\n\nWhy $0? Well, because I paid a nice young gentleman on Fiverr $40 for this sweet ride, and so I was gonna get you to chip in $2 for gas. But apparently the Goog's decided extensions are free. So, $0. \n\nJust here doing a small service for humanity. You're welcome."
