Join the community championing the internet's new cryptocurrency-powered business model.\n\nOur mission: to make it as easy as possible to support content you value online, paving the way for the new economy of the decentralised web.\n\nWhy tip content creators online?\n\nAds don't work for everyone.\nLike it or not, the ad model is the primary business model on many platforms, YouTube included. This poses a problem: the ad model determines the type of content that can exist and thrive online. Indeed, content without a sufficiently large audience struggles to exist at all, despite the fact that a small audience finds the content highly valuable and wants it to grow.\n\nYou set the price.\nIf you buy a book, you pay for it before you even know if you'll find anything of value in it. In a culture where we tip content we value online, you can set the price. Your tip can match exactly what you feel that content was worth.\n\nA business model for the new internet.\nWeb 3.0 is being built with blockchain and decentralised technologies. Now we need to build an ethic and culture around supporting content online so we can move towards a healthier internet economy. Cryptocurrency paves the way for direct fan-to-creator support of online digital media. Tippit aims to make all of this as easy as possible.\n\nFind out more at: https://tippit.co/"
