Please check if this is the case for you as well and try without VPN/proxy.\n\nSome users have reported that the exported file does not have complete data. In all these cases, the data is trimmed after a special character (for example '+' or any other character). I am not able to replicate this issue on my end so can not fix it. If you face similar issue and willing to spend time to resolve this with me, please contact by email.\n\nWhy you need this app?\n\nSalesforce does not provide any feature to export and import the Dependent Picklist Matrix. This extension has the following features:\n\n1. Export the dependency matrix as a CSV file for analysis, reporting, documentation and comparison. \n\n2. Set the dependent picklist values for a controlling field by importing a CSV file.\n\n3. Validate the changes made to the dependency matrix against the existing setup.\n\n4. Compare the dependency matrix across Salesforce orgs.\n\nCompatibility:\n- Supported in Classic\n- Supported in Lightning\n\nDemo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrMLqBj5YBQ\n\nLicense: \nThis extension requires a paid license key and offers a free 7-day free trial. Get the license at https://store.sfdcproducthunt.com/l/sfmatrixext\n\nNOTE: Tested to work when user language is set to English.
