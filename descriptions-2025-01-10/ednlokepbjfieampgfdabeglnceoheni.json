The default keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Period (Command+Period on Mac), but it can be changed from the browser settings. The Picture-in-Picture Shortcut extension button in the browser's toolbar can be used to toggle PiP mode.\n\nGoogle Chrome and other Chromium browsers have a built-in Picture-in-Picture button in the default media controls, but it isn't always available and requires multiple mouse clicks. Picture-in-Picture Shortcut also overrides sites that don't normally allow Picture-in-Picture mode, and attempts to add a play/pause button to the PiP popup. However, this may not always work for sites and players not originally built for PiP mode.\n\nThis extension is open-source under the GPLv3 license, the code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/corbindavenport/pip-shortcut"
