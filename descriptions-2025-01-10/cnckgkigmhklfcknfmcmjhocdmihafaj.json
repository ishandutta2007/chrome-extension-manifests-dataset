Unfortunately, sites like EasyBib, CitationMachine, and CiteThisForMe all detect the fact that you're using an adblocker.  In our experience, they give off false-positives more often than not.  While we do support sites who generate revenue from advertisements, it's safe to say that many sites have too many ads.\n\nWith Bib Bypasser, you won't have to deal with their popups.  This extension blocks requests to the website they host their anti-ad-blocker scripts on.  So, when you load any of their websites, you won't see their annoying popup anymore.  At the time of release, you also won't see Grammarly ads, either!\n\nUpdate 1.3: Added support for popular news websites\n\nUpdate 1.2: Works to defeat a very popular ad blocker detector on many websites\n\nUpdate 1.1: Works on ESPN Tournament Challenge"
