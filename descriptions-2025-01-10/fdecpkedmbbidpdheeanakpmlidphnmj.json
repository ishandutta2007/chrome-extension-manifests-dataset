Not only does this make it harder to get back to a given ticket if you click away from it, it can also result in popup windows piling up under your main browser window without you noticing. This extension automatically changes many links in TeamDynamix to open in a new tab instead of opening additional windows. This helps you keep better track of what you have open and focus on what matters: helping people more effectively."
