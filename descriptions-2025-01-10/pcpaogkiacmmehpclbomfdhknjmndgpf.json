Users are able to change which account is loaded on an existing page, remove Ensighten from pages, or add Ensighten to new pages on their local machine. As of 2021 this extension will also feature the Privacy Inspector feature that allows the user to inspect request and consent data linked to the Ensighten Privacy solution.  It also saw the addition of the Privacy Audit feature which allows the user to audit any web page to check for client-side vulnerabilities.  As of 2022 the server-side tagging explorer was added to allow the user to inspect their SST implementation and debug how tags are perfoming server-side in real-time."
