But what do you do when multiple people need to share control of the same presentation?  \n\nInstead of just telling the presenter to go to the \"next slide\" over and over, use this extension to share control with other attendees easily and seamlessly.\n\nOnce the presenter who sharing their screen installs this extension, they can share control of their currently active Google Slides presentation with other users of this extension. Within Google Meet, other users can easily change slides and control videos.\n\nSupports both the legacy and new, refreshed Meet web user interface."
