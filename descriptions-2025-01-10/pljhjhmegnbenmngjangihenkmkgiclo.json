It provides the ability to ignore users either throughout the workspace or within specific channels.\n\nOnce installed, selecting the extension icon in the menu will open a pop-up that allows adding users and configuring settings.\n\nIt is configurable whether to hide the messages or simply blank them out; the latter option gives the ability to see a message was sent, but does not actually show it. Within the menu is also the ability to select 'All Channels' to ignore the user everywhere or to individually specific channels to ignore the user in.\n\nAdding users is simple, and only requires copying and entering a user's \"Full Name\" (i.e. the name visually shown in messages). All message evaluation is done fully on the client-side by triggering on the user's name."
