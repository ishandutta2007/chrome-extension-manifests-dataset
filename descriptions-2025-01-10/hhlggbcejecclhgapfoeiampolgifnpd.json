Focus on what is important, every day. Do it and feel proud.\n\nGold Medal is helpful when you work with todo's but still want to keep focus on you most important task. A todo list is great to get all the clutter out of your head and feel organized. But how are your organizing your todo list? ;)\n\nWith Gold Medal your decide your main priority. Before checking email in the morning, I decide what I want to accomplish before letting the emails, colleagues and everyone else have a chance to decide my day.. Tim Ferris, Ryan Holiday and a bunch of other busy but organized folks swear by not checking email in the morning and let others decide your todo's. Think of your Gold Medal before you rush into your day!"
