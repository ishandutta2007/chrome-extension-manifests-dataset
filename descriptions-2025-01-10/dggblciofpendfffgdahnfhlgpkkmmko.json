I'll show you a new Spanish word daily as you check your email or browse the web. It'll effortlessly familiarize you with tons of words you can use in your regular Spanish practice. Along with the word, you'll get:\n\n- Easy pronunciation guides (e.g. Poder - poh - dehr)\n- Part of Speech (e.g. verb, noun, etc)\n- A sample sentence with its translation\n\nThanks for letting me be part of your language-learning adventure!"
