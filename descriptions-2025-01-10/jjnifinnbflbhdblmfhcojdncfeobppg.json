That is why Focus Session prevents blocked websites from even beginning to load in order to prevent these tiny dopamine releases that occur when refreshing your feed.\n\nWith Focus Session, you are in control of what to block and when to block it. A session can be started or stopped at the click of a button.\n\nFocus icons created by Freepik - https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/focus"
