You can also add your own links with relevant information for a given web page as well as rank the relevance of existing ones.\n\nWe regularly index 1M+ URLs and objects from Google Scholar, ArXiv, GitHub, GitLab, PapersWithCode, Zenodo, ACM DL and other research websites. You can also use our search engine at https://cKnowledge.io .\n\nPlease, navigate to the MobileNets ArXiv paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) and MLPerf inference benchmark GitHub (https://github.com/mlperf/inference) to test this extension. You click on the blue neuron of this extension to see related code, artifacts and results.\n\nOur GDPR compliant privacy policy: https://cknowledge.io/privacy-for-browser-extension.\n\nSources: https://github.com/gfursin/ck-browser-addon"
