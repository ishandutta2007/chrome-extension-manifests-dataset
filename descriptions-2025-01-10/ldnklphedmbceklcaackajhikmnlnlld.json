Below is a list of all of the features!\n\n\nWalmart Price History and Stock Data\nThis functionality is similar to Keepa or CamelCamelCamel for Walmart in that it tracks Walmart's stock and prices and displays them on an easy-to-read graph to help WM sellers make more informed selling decisions for each SKU.\n\n\nWalmart Item Restriction Checker\nHelp keep your Walmart Seller Center account safe by identifying problematic and restricted products before you list them. This new feature shows whether the product being viewed is restricted on Walmart's Marketplace or is known for having IP, Copyright, or Trademark related issues.\n\n\nWalmart UPC Lookup\nThis extension streamlines the process of listing and pricing items for sale on Walmart.com. It will automatically display the UPC (barcode number) of any item on Walmart.com so that you do not have to hunt for it in the page code. (As a bonus, this extension also shows the UPC codes on Home Depot!)\n\nThe extension also show all variations along with all item IDs, UPCs, and other data of variant items.\n\n**Even if Walmart is not showing the UPC, this extension can pull from other sources and display the UPC code on the page.**\n\nShow Net Price\nThis extension also shows the amount that you would get for selling any item on Walmart.com for the current list price after Walmart takes their 15% seller fee. This helps third-party Walmart sellers competitively price their products and accurately estimate their profits quickly.\n\nNote, if you need help calculating WFS fees, we have a separate free extension here:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/walmart-wfs-profit-calcul/boecmgggeigllcdocgioijmleimjbfkg\n\n\nShow Stats on Category and Search Pages\nOn the search results pages, this extension also displays the number of sellers, item rank, quick delivery options and whether the item is also sold and shipped by Walmart, Inc. All of this information can help third-party sellers make competitive inventory, pricing, and shipping decisions.\n\n\nJoin our Facebook group here for updates and support: https://www.facebook.com/groups/walmartmastery\n\nWhat features do you want to see next?
