Note that, this extension can be buggy sometimes as I only have a chance to try it on my own account but no other.\n\nFractions is a fully featured Chrome extension that helps you analyze and visualize your Medium Partner Program earnings. It is way powerful than default Partner Program Dashboard, Medium provides. Using this extension, you can inspect the data about your,\n\n- lifetime earnings since you enrolled in to Medium Partner Program,\n- monthly earnings,\n- daily total member reading time,\n- realtime currency conversion,\n- yesterday's total earnings,\n- yesterday's top earning post,\n- estimated earnings by the end of the month---_with a special algortihm_,\n- daily average earnings,\n- percent difference from the previous month,\n- this month's top earning post,\n- total tax you pay,\n- monthly predicted tax,\n- net earnings.\n\nIn Partner Dashboard, all we get is monthly and referred member earnings. There's no stat about what I earned yesterday, total member time, or the net earnings without taxes. So, I made this Chrome extension as a total replacement for Partner Dashboard. It includes everything Partner Dashboard, but adds more features on top of them, using the data scattered around."
