The first one is volume, the second is balance and, the last one is amplify. All these settings are stored for the current tab only. Once you change tabs, settings are reset to defaults. The volume setting is from 0 to 100 units. The balance variable changes from (-100%) to (+100%), where -100% is the left speaker only and (+100%) is the right one. Any value between these numbers divides the sound output between speakers proportionally. The last setting is for the amplify option, which amplifies the output sound from 100% to 500%. 100 is the original level and, 500 makes the output sound five times louder than the normal settings. The last three options are related to 3D audio spatializations, where you can adjust the position of the panner or listener in 3D space. Furthermore, three buttons are at the bottom-right corner of the popup. From left to right, are the reload (to reload the active tab), support, and donation buttons.\n\nNote 1: By default, all the adjustments are non-persistent, meaning if the active tab is reloaded, the sound is reverted to the original setting. If you want to make it persistent, please press the PERSISTENT button at the top header (it asks for permission to access the current domain).\n\nNote 2: This add-on only works for HTML5 audio and video elements. Moreover, currently, the add-on does not work for media elements embedded in frames.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/sound-adjustment.html)."
