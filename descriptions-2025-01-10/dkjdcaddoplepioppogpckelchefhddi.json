Good for passing out visualisations generated with D3.\n\n----\n\nUses Eli Grey's fileSaver routine: https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/\n\n1.1: Now adds dummy svg node which holds computed style of svg element's parent node. Irons out a few discrepancies.\n\n1.11: Dummy svg node now holds computed style of actual svg element, solves couple of further bugs.\n\n1.12: Catches errors caused by invalid style rules rather than crashes\n\n1.13: Couple more errors to do with parent style recognition ironed out.\n\n1.14: Can now also pull out svg elements within IFrames.\n\n1.15: Bugfix when css styles not present - xinczhang\n\n1.16: Bugfix when IFrame is inaccessible (caused crash)\n\n1.17: Bugfix where styles applied to svg element itself weren't being picked up\n\n1.18: Bugfix where class being an SVGAnimatedString caused a crash. Thanks to Robert Kerr for spotting this.\n\n1.19: Thanks to Severin Neumann for adding the ability to include images embedded in SVG.\n\n1.20: Catch stylesheet access exception error\n\n1.22: Add alert popup to say what svgExport has found. Save svg's with slightly useful filenames (svg element's id and class)\n\n1.23 Update to manifest v3, remove some unneeded permissions"
