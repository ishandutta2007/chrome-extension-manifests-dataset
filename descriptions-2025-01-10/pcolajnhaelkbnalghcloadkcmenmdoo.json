It does this by using the most capable AI language model currently available (which is continually updated as better ones are released) to give you professional messages specific to your intent that you can build off of or use outright.\n\nThe goal is to make you more efficient at sending high quality English messages in your professional and personal life.\n\n\nUsage:\n\nQuickfire has two modes. You can generate responses to messages by entering the message you received. This will give you a response, which you can copy to your clipboard by clicking.\n\nYou can also generate messages from a prompt. This is useful if you want to write a message with specific intent and details, but aren't sure how best to word it. You can enter what you want to say, and the AI will make it sound professional and polished.\n\n\nSubscription:\n\nRunning AI models is cost-intensive, as we need to pay for time on powerful servers. To pay these bills, we run a subscription at $10/month that gives you full access to the tool. There is a one-week free trial available as you evaluate the tool. \n\n\nPrivacy:\n\nThe only data we collect is your email address (which is never shared) and the number of generations you create per month which we use to prevent system abuse. The content is sent right to the large language model API provided by OpenAI, and then deleted. Your payment data is handled by Stripe, a company that specializes in secure payment processing. If you have further privacy concerns, please get in touch.\n\n\nSupport:\n\nIf you have issues or recommendations for improvement, please email the developer at support@quickfireai.com."
