From a WikiTree profile page it provides the ability to search other genealogy websites for relevant records.\n\n2. From one of these genealogy websites' records page it can extract data and build a citation.\n\n3. Also from one of these genealogy websites records page it can search other genealogy websites for similar records. For example on an Ancestry page it can help find free versions of the same original source.\n\nThe extension is free but donations are welcome at: https://buymeacoffee.com/RobPavey\n\nThe extension has very little performance impact unless you are actively using it. It does not modify any web pages and does nothing (other than registering a listener) until it's popup menu is used."
