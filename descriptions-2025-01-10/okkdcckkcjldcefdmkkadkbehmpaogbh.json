Unlike other tools, BaseJump isn’t just for Jira—it works with any URL, so you can use it for lots of different websites. You can save more than one base URL, give each one a name to keep things organized, and easily build and open links with added details. This makes BaseJump a helpful tool for anyone who needs to work with web links that have similar patterns. All data is securely stored locally in your browser, and the extension does not collect or transmit any user data, ensuring your information remains private."
