The items are grouped into categories and each items has a checkbox to mark as done for the current review. You can also copy an item's text for use in your CR/PR comments. The selections are not lost as the data is stored in the local browser storage. A button is provided to clear all the selections.\nThe code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/aqib-bhat/code-review-guidelines and lists items for future work. May you be great at reviewing code!"
