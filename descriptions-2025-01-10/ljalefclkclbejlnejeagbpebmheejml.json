The actual regex operation is performed in a separate thread using an HTML5 worker so that the app never freezes or slows down even on complicated expressions or long blocks of text.\n\nFeatures:\n - Replaced matches are highlighted in the output.\n - By pressing the execute button or hitting the enter key, the current output will be moved to the input box.\n - The input and output boxes scroll together so that they can be more easily compared side-by-side.\n\nStill to come:\n - Provide flags for things such as case insensitive searches.\n - Improve the input/output comparison so that it better compares lines.\n - Highlight matches\n - Save search/replace patterns for re-use\n\nChangelog:\n - v0.1.0\n - - Initial Release\n - v0.2.0\n - - The regex can't be executed while the background process is running or if there's an error. The Execute button will gray out to signify this.\n - v0.2.1\n - - Updated the manifest to v2\n - - Fixed the way escape sequences are done in the replacement so \\\\n should render now as \\n rather than as a slash followed by a line break."
