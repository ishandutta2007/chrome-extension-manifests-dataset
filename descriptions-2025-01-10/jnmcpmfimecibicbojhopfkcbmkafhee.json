There can be many reasons for that; the service is blocked by a website or it's a subscription only website.\n\nThe extension solves these issues by sending the full content of the page you want to save, including images.\n\nSelect content\n\nIn other occasions, you might need to save only a specific part of a page. If you select some text and click on the Readeck button, only the selected part will be sent to Readeck.\nYou can even save multiple selections at once!"
