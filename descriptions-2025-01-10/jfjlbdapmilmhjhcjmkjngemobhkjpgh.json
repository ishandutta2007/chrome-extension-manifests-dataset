We have started with an experiment where we test the capabilities of our browsers to handle encryption and store, manage and share the said encrypted data. We wish to extrapolate this feature to all applications someday, where any form ( or POST/PUT request ), is interrupted and encrypted as per the users desire, allowing them to share with the application, other users and the world only what they wish and when they wish. We also imagine that a personal data store would go hand in hand with current system of data silos, allowing us to build a sort of a validated internet identity for the user, which then application developer could leverage to handle user login/signup for them. We have taken the first steps and we realize there is still a long way to go, and we are always looking for help. \n\nAt the present the extension is designed to work with applications that people at The Third Pillar have built, Identity and Gigs."
