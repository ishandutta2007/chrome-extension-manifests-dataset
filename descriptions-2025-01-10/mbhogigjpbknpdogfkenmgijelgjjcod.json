Looking for that one clip in a 2 hour podcast? Don't want to listen to that entire lecture your professor posted? Well you're in luck!\n\nIf any YouTube video has closed captions enabled, this extension will add a search button to the video player so that you can search the transcript and navigate to each timestamp in the video where your query is spoken. This extension strives to feel as native as possible, as if it were a feature built right into YouTube.\n\n- It will not seek to the exact moment your query is spoken, but instead it seeks to the timestamp where the caption would appear on screen.\n- Use ENTER to seek to the next occurrence in the video and the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to cycle between previous and next.\n- Limited to videos where closed captions are available.\n- Limited to youtube.com (will not work on embedded videos).\n\n*** After installing, refresh any tabs that are running YouTube."
