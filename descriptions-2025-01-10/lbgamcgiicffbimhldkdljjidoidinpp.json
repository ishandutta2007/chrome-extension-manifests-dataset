(Joint applicants will need to fill out the \"Applicant 2\" fields as well.)\n\nFor sale listings, the extension will automatically calculate, colour code and display the estimated monthly mortgage payment and affordability rating. For rent listings, it will similarly calculate, colour code and display the affordability rating as well as the extra annual income you'd need to afford a listing if it is out of your range.\n\nAffordability is calculated based on estimated monthly repayment/rent relative to monthly salary(s) after tax. Affordable is classed as when monthly payment is 0-30% of salary (affordability rating 70-100%), Feasible as 31-35% (65-69%), Longshot as 36-50% (50-64%) and Unaffordable as 51%+ (0-49%).\n\nUsers also have the oppportunity to filter (display/hide) listings by affordability category (Affordable, Feasible, Longshot, Unaffordable).\n\nThis extension does not collect any personal data and includes open-source code by Josh Embling licensed under the MIT License."
