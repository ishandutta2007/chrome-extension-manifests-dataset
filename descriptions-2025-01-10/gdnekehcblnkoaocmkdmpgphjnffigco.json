Alchemy/Rebalanced cards are supported, as are double-sided cards. Links to Gatherer, Scryfall, and EDHREC are provided for every card. \n\nSelect a card name and activate the extension using the right-click menu or keyboard shortcut Option+Shift+S (macOS) or Alt+Shift+S (Windows/Linux) to look up the card. Escape closes the cards one by one.\n\nPress Option+Shift+E (macOS) or Alt+Shift+E (Windows/Linux) to open a popup in which you can type the name of a card to search for. Escape closes the search popup if you want to cancel.\n\nMTG Quick Search is an unofficial extension made by an MTG fan, and is not directly affiliated with Wizards of the Coast. Uses Scryfall's generously provided API."
