Eradicate distractions by replacing your entire news feed with an inspiring quote. You'll still have access to messages and notifications, meaning you won't have a reason to disable Marathon.\n\nWant to check a Reddit link? Go right ahead. Marathon replaces the Reddit feed with an inspirational quote but still lets you view individual posts.\n\nMarathon was built out of a frustration with existing productivity tools; when productivity extensions are too aggressive, it's too easy to disable them for a one-off use case only to never enable them again. Marathon is built around the idea that it's a marathon, not a sprint. \n\nUpcoming features:\n- Block Youtube recommended section\n- Conditional blocking based on time (i.e. allow reddit on weekends)"
