Let's change that.\n\nGreenScreen is a Google Chrome extension that filters out any words and images that are not vegan-friendly and replaces them with plant-based alternatives. This will ensure ease of mind when browsing, and even come up with vegan-friendly recipe substitutions for when you find a recipe that wasn't developed with moral concern in mind."
