Injects the accounts and allows signing transactions for a specific account.\n\nThis extension injects the accounts and allows signing of messages and transactions for a specific account, without making the account secrets available to the calling app.\n\nThis allows you to manage your accounts, without storing it in the browser site-specific localStorage, for use on applications such as https://dapps.chainx.org. It does not allow for full wallet capability, but rather is laser focused on only managing your accounts and providing signing capabilities to applications requesting access. As such, its prime purpose is managing the accounts and injecting them as the standard extension interfaces.\n\nIt allows you to:\n\n- Add accounts, storing the account secrets in your extension storage\n- Allow application access to the signing capabilities of these accounts (you can accept/reject requests)\n- Allows you to sign transactions for ChainX network\n- In all of this no secretes leave the extension, only the signature is ever provided"
