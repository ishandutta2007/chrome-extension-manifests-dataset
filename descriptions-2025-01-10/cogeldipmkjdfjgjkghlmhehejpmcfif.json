It provides a better developer experience than the widely used Redux devtools extension for  monitoring state machines. XState Ninja is more ergonomic and removes common pain points experienced with Redux devtools:\n\nðŸ‘‰ more than one machine can be tracked at once in multiple swimlanes\nðŸ‘‰ machine state is clearly visible (including parallel states)\nðŸ‘‰ no events are missed regardless of when the devtool was opened\nðŸ‘‰ side effects (invoked services and actions) are clearly visible\nðŸ‘‰ all invoked or spawned actors are monitored, including invoked/spawned callbacks and promises\nðŸ‘‰ dead actors are clearly marked (ðŸ’€) so there is no confusion if multiple machines of the same ID are started"
