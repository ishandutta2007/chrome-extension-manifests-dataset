Perfect for stitching together Endurance Runs, 24-Hour Extra Life streams, GDC chats with a side of Buckfast, PAX panels, and of course it's safe for the occasional multi-part Puppy Chat.\n\nIt'll also accommodate for size depending on whether you've Embiggened or not, showing or hiding the episode descriptions.\n\nI would love to hear any feedback, suggestions, or issues you encounter if you happen to give it a shot.  Hope you like it.  Thanks."
