But having inactive friends who don't engage with your content is actually hurting your reach and marketing efforts. Enter Friend Ejector.\n\nSo you need to remove inactive and deactivated friends from your Facebook account.\n\nFriend Ejector will sync up your friends list. It will then allow you to run a scan up for up to 180 days in the past that will fetch all engagement from your friends. You'll be able to see how many reactions and comments your friends have left on your posts. And you'll also be able to see how many messages you all have had via messenger.\n\nYou can white-list people who you never want to remove and you can select all the people you want to remove and click the unfriend option.\n\nAfter you've removed all your inactive Friends you can use our software The Credit Connector to fill your friends list back up with hyper targeted leads. And repeat this process over and over."
