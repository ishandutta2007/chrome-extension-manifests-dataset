It also lets you have a glimpse of the local weather and help you decide what you would like to wear on campus or if you would like to work from home in case of the rain. myBeaverTab also comes with a tiny Tic-Tac-Toe game that lets you take a break from your busy schedule. And gain easy access to the Oregon State University website, MyOSU, Canvas and the clubs that are available this year. \n\nGet inspired by background images taken on campus and a clock to help you keep track of time. The images change every 24 hours. However, if you would like to change the background today, then you can click on the link on the top of the page."
