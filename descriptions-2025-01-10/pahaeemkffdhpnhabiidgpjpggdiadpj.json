Endlessly clicking onto the next link. With Resonance this issue is removed. Resonance allows you to select a number of links and place them into either an existing Youtube playlist or a new one. \n\nBeing able to listen to these songs in an endless stream has definitely made my music listening a lot easier and I'm happy to be able to share this with everyone. \n\nInstructions: \n\n1) Go onto the Facebook group you would like to extract links on\n2) Open the Resonance extension (The vinyl disk in your extensions bar)\n3) Fill in the form and hit go\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n\nAs of version 1.4.6 Resonance now anonymously collects and stores the YouTube data that it extracts. Currently this is only confined to the video ID and the title. This is part of a new process of turning Resonance into a community whereby users will be able to see which songs are being extracted and are most popular. No personal data will be collected. \n\nThanks\n\nUPDATE (22/11/2017)\n\nIts come to my attention that Resonance is no longer working. Currently I do not have the time to fix it but I am hoping to fix it before the new year.\n\nThanks\nRobbie"
