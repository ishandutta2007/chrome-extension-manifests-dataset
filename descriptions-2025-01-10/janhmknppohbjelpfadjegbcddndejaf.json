Side Chatter enables you to discuss, ask questions, share insights, or simply to chat and discover people with similar interests.\n\nTo activate Side Chatter, click on the Side Chatter icon on the browser menu bar.  A chatroom, filled with lively discussion about the topic you're reading, is always just one click away.  That is the idea of Side Chatter.\n\nSide Chatter tries to be non-intrusive.  It doesn't inject itself into every web page you visit.  So it won't negatively affect your browsing speed, or present a cause for privacy concerns.\n\nThis is an open-source project.  To contribute, please visit https://github.com/ken107/side-chatter."
