However, files on the 'Content' tab such as PDF's and video's are shown using a built-in viewer. Users that would like to switch between several files either find themselves clicking between the various topics on BrightSpace or downloading them first and then opening them in separate tabs. This hinders productivity and is not the best user experience. It would be great if users could easily open such files in new tabs.\n\nWhat does this extension do?\nThis extension allows the users to open PDF's and video's (such as lecture recordings) on BrightSpace in a new Google Chrome tab, by adding a new button on the content pages. Clicking this button will open a new tab containing the content that is currently active.\n\nDoes it always work?\nThe extension works with PDF files and video's both for students and course administrators. There are, however, several ways to upload documents, and not all are supported by this extension. Nonetheless, most should work.\n\nFor a list of supported institutions, see https://github.com/WesselvanDam/bs-extension/tree/main#supported-institutions\n\nDon't see yours? Place the link that your institution uses in a comment and I will add support as soon as possible.\n\nFor the source code of this extension, see https://github.com/WesselvanDam/bs-extension"
