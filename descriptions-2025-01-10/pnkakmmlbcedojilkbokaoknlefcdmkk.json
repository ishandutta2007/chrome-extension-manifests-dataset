It can also be played for free on the website https://monkeymart.org/. In Hangman, players are presented with a hidden word and must guess the letters one by one to uncover the word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's gallows is drawn, adding to the suspense. The objective is to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn. It's a fun and challenging game that tests your vocabulary and deduction skills. Play Hangman on the Monkey Mart website and see if you can save the hangman from his fate!\n\n\n*Note: We have added \"Classroom 6x\" button, making it easy for players to quickly access the games on our website! https://classroom-6x.org/, https://monkeymart.org/"
