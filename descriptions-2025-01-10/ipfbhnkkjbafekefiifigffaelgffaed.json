Native language transcriptions and translations to English are supported, as well as some non-speech sounds.\n\nProtect your ears with lower volumes, get the gist of that foreign language dialogue, improve your retention while studying, and follow the conversation!\n\nSubtitle Anything is:\n\n1. Free: No monthly payments or credits. If your device supports it, you can run it forever. Free.\n\n2. Private: No data leaves your device. Subtitle Anything doesn't run translations using Google's (or any other) services.\n\n3. Flexible: No site specific support. One extension. Any tab that plays audio. 99 languages plus autodetect.\n\nThis extension doesn't show ads and doesn't send your data anywhere.\n\nSubtitles are generated by continually capturing a buffer of recent audio from any tab and passing it to a machine learning model. It needs a graphics card to do this quickly enough, and support on Linux is experimental.\n\nSee the official website for more documentation:\nhttps://www.subtitle-anything.com/\n\nFeel free to check out the GitHub releases and issues tracker here:\nhttps://github.com/ae9is/subtitle-anything/"
