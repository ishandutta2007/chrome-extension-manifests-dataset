Did you ever hear the tragedy of the HTTTP Status code? I thought not. It is not a story the sysadmins would tell you. It's a www legend. HTTP status codes are so powerful that they reveal what happened to the website. But developers have the most boring webpages to show them. Unfortunately, this chrome extension reduces the meanings even more and makes them into prequel memes.
