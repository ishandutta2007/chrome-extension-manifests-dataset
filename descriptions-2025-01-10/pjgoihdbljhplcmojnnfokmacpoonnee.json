From there, the user can:\n1. Pause and resume the timer and music.\n2. Customize the number of minutes allocated to the work and break time intervals.\n\nThe extension also shows the user:\n1. A timer which shows how long the current interval will last\n2. How many Pomodoros they've completed in their session. (1 Pomodoro is 1 cycle of work and break)\n3. A progress bar which goes along with the timer, showing the elapsed time against the time until the next interval.\n4. The embedded Youtube video stream.\n\nThe extension can also be toggled to send a notification and/or play a sound to the user when a work/break period is starting.\n\nThe main defining feature behind the Lofidoro assistant is that it livestreams music from Youtube. The user only has to click an icon on the top bar of their chrome browser. Automatically, music will start to play and a Pomodoro timer will allow the user to immediately start working.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/jpolina/lofi-pomodoro-chrome-extension\n\nTomato icons created by AomAm - Flaticon, https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/tomato"
