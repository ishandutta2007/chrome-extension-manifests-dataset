With a single click on the ‘ZWO’ button on any TrainerRoad workout page, your workout is converted to a ZWO file, ready to be used in Zwift. Once you move the downloaded file to your Zwift Workouts folder, it seamlessly integrates into your ‘Custom Workouts’ list for your next session.\n\nThe tool converts steady-state intervals, ramps, and over-unders. There are options available to tweak the workout intervals for more Zwift XP.\n\nHere’s how easy it is:\n1. Install this extension.\n2. Visit your chosen workout on TrainerRoad.\n3. Use the ‘ZWO’ button to convert and download the workout.\n4. Place the file in your Zwift ‘Workouts’ folder, under your Zwift ID folder.\n\nUser-configurable options (available from the extension's 'Details' page or by right-clicking the extension's icon in the toolbar, if you have it pinned):\n1. Ramp to Steady-State Conversion:\n    - None: Leave the ramps as found in the TrainerRoad workout.\n    - Internal: Leave only warmup/cooldown ramps (if any).\n    - All: Convert all ramps to steady-state intervals.\n2. Steady-State to Over-Under Conversion:\n   - Strict: Each power target must match exactly when recognizing over-unders.\n   - Loose: Some minor variation in power targets is allowed.\n   - None: Leave the individual steady-state intervals alone.\n\nNeed help importing workouts? Zwift Support offers a comprehensive guide here: https://support.zwift.com/en_us/custom-workouts-ryGOTVEPs.\n\nSource code available at https://github.com/jsmattsonjr/trzwo.\n\nPlease report any issues via <https://github.com/jsmattsonjr/trzwo/issues.>\n\nRecent issues:\n\n*  9 May 2024 - Workout bodies were empty, because the format of the\n                TrainerRoad workout files changed slightly.\n* 25 May 2024 - The ZWO button didn't appear, because the 'Schedule'\n                button was changed to 'Add to Calendar'.\n\nNot associated with TrainerRoad or Zwift.\n\nNote on Download Location (15 October 2024)\n\nWhile Chrome extensions can only download files to your Downloads folder (or a subfolder), you can arrange for the downloaded ZWO files to land in your Zwift Workouts folder. Here's a detailed guide for both Mac and Windows users:\n\nStep 1: Create a symbolic link (Mac) or junction (Windows)\n\nFor Mac Users:\n\nOpen Finder.\nClick on \"Applications\" in the sidebar.\nOpen the \"Utilities\" folder.\nDouble-click on \"Terminal\" to open it.\nIn the Terminal window, copy and paste the following command, replacing <your-Zwift-ID> with your actual Zwift ID:\n\nln -s $HOME/Documents/Zwift/Workouts/<your-Zwift-ID> Downloads/Workouts\n\nFor Windows Users:\n\nPress the Windows key + R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.\nType cmd and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.\nIn the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command, replacing <your-Zwift-ID> with your actual Zwift ID:\n\nmklink /J Downloads\\Workouts Documents\\Zwift\\Workouts\\<your-Zwift-ID>\n\nStep 2: Install RegExp Download Organizer\n\nOpen Google Chrome.\nVisit the RegExp Download Organizer page in the Chrome Web Store.\nClick the \"Add to Chrome\" button.\n\nStep 3: Configure RegExp Download Organizer\n\nAfter installation, click on the RegExp Download Organizer icon in your Chrome toolbar.\nSelect \"Options\" from the dropdown menu.\nOn the options page, click the \"New Rule from text...\" button.\nCopy and paste the following text into the text box:\n\n{\"enabled\":true,\"description\":\"ZWO files\",\"filename\":\".*\\\\.zwo$\",\"pattern\":\"Workouts/\",\"conflict-action\":\"overwrite\"}\n\nClick \"Create Rule.\"\n\n(Optional) You can uncheck any other rules if you don't want to use the full functionality of RegExp Download Organizer.\n\nWith this setup, your downloaded ZWO files will automatically land in your Zwift Workouts folder, eliminating the need for manual transfers."
