Using a plugin you can do this. This extension demonstrates some simple jQuery plugins we have made for common requests. \n\nYou control the modifications!  You can choose to contract Dell Kace Services to make modifications or you can do them yourself.  Administrators always control the javascript source and have access to it.\n\nI like to summarize this plugin as \"ticket rules for the front end\"."
