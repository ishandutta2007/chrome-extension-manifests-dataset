A quick and easy button that I can pin to my toolbar, which (with a single click) displays a lively menu assortment of my most frequently-used sites, with fun and readily-identifiable (to ME) animations.  Large enough so my diminished eyesight doesn't have a problem with it.\n\nI had done this manually before, as a single image I manually cobbled together with clickable regions in the map element over it...but the links rapidly became out of date, or the sites became less frequently used.  And re-doing the static images was a nuisance.  THIS represents a revitalized version of the tool I made for myself.  So I thought, \"Hey, maybe someone else might like it, too.\"\n\nData is stored in the Google Sync storage space...meaning that if you install the extension on one PC where your browser has that enabled, and you configure everything the way you like it, everything should get copied over.  In theory.  Your mileage may vary.\n\nI don't have a dialog box for finding local files for the icons.  I don't WANT to have to manage local files...so each icon is just the URL to an internet-available image.  They're not hard to find:  though with some you may have to dig a little deeper to find the actual GIF file, and not just the wrapper around it.  C'est la vie.\n\nThe popup is limited by the browser, so no:  it can't be any bigger than that.  Not and still be a popup.  You can add up to 124 icons (plus the 2 static ones, for me and the gear icon for the settings) making a max 14x9 grid.  The program will try to adjust and get the optimum layout in the available space up to that point...but once the icons are that small, we're kind of missing the point.\n\nVersion 1.1:  Added the ability to reset the menu to the default, export settings to a text file, or import settings.  Useful to share between different Google Sync accounts.\n\nThe 'Mid-Nite Drive-Thru' is a concept:  a neon-lit greasy spoon fast-food joint which appears along the side of the road as you speed through the darkness on some overnight road trip.  I hope you find something there that tickles your fancy."
