Useful for testing web applications by redirecting certain endpoints to a test server.\n\nThis is just a simple extension I wrote a long time ago for doing some testing. The extension is open source, and I welcome any feature requests. The full source is here: https://github.com/markwatson/url-mover\n\nThe permissions required for this extension are pretty broad, but they're needed to be able to rewrite URLs. This extension uses no remote code and doesn't make network calls. You can verify the source on GitHub - it's about a hundred lines long currently."
