Science fiction and fantasy have been effective vehicles of social commentary since their beginning. The distance provided by these stories helps to return strangeness to what has become ordinary. This plugin leverages terms from the milieu of speculative fiction in order to bring absurdity, commentary, humor, strangeness, and disbelief to the current state of our fossil fuel economy.\n\nHave an idea?
