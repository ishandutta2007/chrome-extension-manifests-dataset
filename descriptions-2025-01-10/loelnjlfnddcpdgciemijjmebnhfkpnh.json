This extension gives you a preview of real title of the article. There are three possibilities:\n1) SAME: the link text and the article title matches.\n2) INCLUDED: the link text is included in the article title.\n3) DIFFERENT: is the link text and the article title don't match, the extension shows how much they differ, in %.\n\nIt also shows the description of the page (if exists).\n\nTriggers an alert if the link goes to a different domain (fake advertising articles)."
