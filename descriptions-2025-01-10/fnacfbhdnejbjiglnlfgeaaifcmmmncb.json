Technically the solution is based on the NativeMessaging feature of the browser and runs a simple Java application in the background to execute printing on the local machine. Currently it only supports Windows and OSX, but it should be easy to adjust other unix-like systems.\n\nOne of the main design goals was to be able to pick the printer to be used from the web application, meaning obviously that the application needs to be aware of the available printers on the users machine. NinjaPrinter ships with support for 2 different type of documents: ZPL (label) and the PDF, but extending it should be fairly straight forward."
