This version does not work on Google Docs and Gmail YET. Download it now, and we will have a fix soon. :)\n\nDiacritics, symbols, and special characters are an important part of any language, and as insignificant as they might initially seem, they play a powerful role in the true meaning and authenticity of communication. With Accents, improve the language learning experience; get better search results; communicate more clearly in everyday writing; and promote your education, productivity, and diversity.\n\nTO USE:\n1. Hold down a key when typing and wait for the pop-up to appear. Try it with uppercase letters, punctuation marks, and other symbols too.\n2. To select the character you desire, you can either press the number or click on the button itself. \n3. There is also a shortcut you can use: while holding the key, press the number of the button before the popup appears.\n\nTest it out on your favorite websites.\n\nThanks!"
