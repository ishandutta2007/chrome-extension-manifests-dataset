That's why our Ranking Algorithm is solely based on qualitative factor of the user interaction such as our 5 Star Ranking, Bookmarking and Sharing Signals to calculate a Content Rating. Rankle does not crawl the whole web. Instead of that, Rankle only takes into account Content users bookmark and therewith register in our index.\n\nVisual Surfing with Content Cards\nWe also believe that Web Surfing has to be visual and not just textual. That's why we provide our Content Recommendations in Cards with either embedded Video and Audio Files or Screenshots of the related Sites with a one-click Link to the Site. You can play Video and Audio files directly in Rankle as well open directly the site of the content. Rankle is a Recommendation Engine and therefore we will guide you to the content of your interest and don't keep you captured on Rankle.\n\nMachine Learning System\nWe also applied a Machine Learning Algorithm, wich constantly learns from the user interaction in order make even more precise Recommendations according to the users interests.\n\nNo Sign-up Barriers\nWhile other systems first enforces the user the sign-up, we believe in the opposite way and don't force the users to sign-up, making it open to discover and search without a login. But for sure, we want to have a dedicated Community of users contribute to grow Rankle and helping to constantly improve the quality of the Content Recommendation and the whole Platform."
