This way, users can easily share information with their team members by typing memorable shortlinks directly into their browser's address bar.\n\nThe ToLinks extension comes with several key features, including the ability to directly enter or instantly create short links, omnibox search support for easy searching, and the option to convert text into clickable short links. ToLinks is GDPR compliant, ensuring the security and privacy of user data.\n\nToLinks aims to simplify resource hunting and knowledge gaps for busy teams, allowing them to quickly access the tools they need. \n\nFor more information, refer to: https://tolinks.io."
