The mouse gestures can be configured from the extension's options, and the customization of zoom levels is also supported.\n\nThe continued development of Scroll Zoom is made possible thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please check out https://armin.dev/go/patreon\n\nDue to browser restrictions the extension does not work on the Chrome Web Store website or local browser and extension pages, such as chrome://extensions.\n\nThe \"Allow access to file URLs\" option must be enabled to zoom saved web pages opened in a tab. Visit the chrome://extensions page and open the extension's details to find the option.\n\nRelevant browser bugs:\n  â€¢ On macOS and Linux the secondary (right) mouse button gesture does not zoom pages as expected, the context menu is shown\n\nThe extension is also available for Edge and Firefox: https://github.com/dessant/scroll-zoom#readme\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/scroll-zoom"
