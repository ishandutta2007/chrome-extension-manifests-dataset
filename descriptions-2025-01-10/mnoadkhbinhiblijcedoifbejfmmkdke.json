Well you found the cure!\n\nI know there are a couple of similar extensions out there. At first, I wanted to just download one and save myself some time. I soon realized that existing extensions out there for this purpose are so bulky and complicated. Some of them even ask you to install a daemon process that's available on Windows only - this is real bad, and dangerous, but also real bad.\n\nThis extension simply makes page zoom settings independent across tabs, regardless of whether they have the same origin. It's ultra-lightweight. It uses a built-in Chrome API, just a few lines of code, no configuration needed at all!\n\nYou can unpack the extension to verify that it's not doing anything malicious. In fact I encourage everyone to read it because it's so simple. You could've written it yourself!  A copy of the source code is at https://github.com/xinan/zoom-per-tab."
