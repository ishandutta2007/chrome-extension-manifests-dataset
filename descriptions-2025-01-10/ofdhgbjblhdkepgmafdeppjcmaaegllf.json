It is like a brand! Have you ever had the experience of finding someone's GitHub profile very interesting and you had the curiosity to see his/hers other social networks as well? Finding it manually can be a little bit repetitive, you have to copy and paste the same handle for every social network, some people even search for it instead. Yes, the stalking task might be a little boring sometimes. That's why I created Handle Stalker. Now you can be a faster stalker LOL Just kidding! Handle Stalker can also help you to see if a specific handle is still not taken. How great is that? :) Feel free to write down any feedback."
