A frustration of seeing the media push an agenda of hate against Islam by continuously painting all of Islam as evil. A frustration of seeing the actions of a few extremists be used to unfairly represent a whole religion.\n\nI noticed that whenever news of a terrorist attack broke out, one of the first things I would think was 'is the perpetrator Muslim?'. Sometimes I would find out that the attack was actually carried out by a Christian, but of course this wouldn't make the headlines. \n\nIt's no secret that western media outlets are doing well in creating a inhumane and evil picture of Islam. \n\nThis extension will allow Chrome users to browse the internet without being influenced by hateful articles. \n\nCommon words used to describe terrorists such as \"isis\" and \"islamic state\", will be changed to \"Crazy Hate Group\"\n\nTry it out 'Type 'Isis' into Google search or Twitter and see how the results change!\n\n**WARNING - Once added to Chrome this extension will work on every page you visit including all Social Media**\n\n**LEAVE ANY FEEDBACK IN THE REVIEW SECTION**"
