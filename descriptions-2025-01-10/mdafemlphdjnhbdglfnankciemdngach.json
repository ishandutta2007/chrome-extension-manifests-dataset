You never know what you are going to get. \n\nOur squirrels are all highly qualified presetologists, hand-picked from the best squirrel art colleges. They are extremely dedicated to their craft, spending most of their time in the nut lab - fiddling with sliders in search of the illusive 'perfect preset'. \n\nAll you have to do is choose between a colour, black & white or vintage preset and the squirrels will get to work for you.\n\nOur squirrels have been working hard on version 5.3 and are proud to announce some great new features:\n- the squirrels now deal with being offline more gracefully\n- choose the frequency of squirrel celebrations\n- see a count of how many presets you have generated over time\n- UI improvements"
