We are constantly improving our results and features, so if you've encountered a wrong detection or an unexpected behavior, please help by reporting it via email: support@aishield.one - Thank you!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR USE: after adding the extension, browse to ChatGPT.com and click the extension icon. You can then sign-up or login (free!) and the extension icon will turn green - now you're protected!\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nAI Shield monitors usage of ChatGPT and detects unsafe actions such as:\n1. Sharing private data unsecurely (credit cards, social security numbers, email and physical addresses)\n2. Engaging in harmful or violent activities (hate speech, violent language).\n3. Trying to use ChatGPT for malicious or criminal use (faking documents or identities, planning illegal activities, asking for instructions of unsafe topics)\n\nUpon detection of such unsafe action, AI Shield will notify the user via a prominent popup, detailing the problematic prompt and the categories of safe use breached by it. Additionally, AI Shield will notify the account holder (manager / parent) via email on the unsafe usage detected.\n\nThe extension monitoring and notification activity can be paused by the user only if they supply the admin password (in order to prevent users masking their unsafe activity and then re-activating AI Shield)."
