Simply select text, then right click it to select the \"Highlight\" option. The sync will run itself in the background. \n\nAll highlighted texts are saved so that your highlights are not lost when exiting a page! Simply re-opening that page will bring back all the highlights. NOTE: This does not work on very dynamic webpages like Facebook and most email clients.\n\nWe sync the highlights to notion by default, you can close the sync by on click.\n\nDisclaimer: We DO NOT collect any usage data until now, all data are stored using chrome local storage and in your notion workspace. \n\nAdditionally:\nOur project is forked from the open source repository: https://github.com/jeromepl/highlighter, and i just changed a little. Thanks for the Source author."
