Links for the properly configured extension are available through the Lexmark Cloud Print Management portal. \n\nCloud Print Management for Chrome is part of the Lexmark Cloud Print Management solution.  The Cloud Print Management for Chrome extension provides access from the Google Chrome browser to Lexmark's Cloud Print Management for printing. \n\nInstead of sending documents through a print server to a designated print device— where the pages sit out in public view until they are retrieved—they are transferred to the Lexmark Cloud where they are held in a personal queue until the user logs in or swipes their badge (authenticates) at the printer.\n\nFor more information on Lexmark Cloud Services, go to https://www.lexmark.com/en_us/solutions/lexmark-cloud-services.html \n\nTo view the End User License Agreement, go to https://lexmark.com/LXKCloudChromeExt-eula",

The Cloud Print Management for Google Chrome extension provides access from Google Chrome and the Google Chrome browser to Lexmark's Cloud Print Management subscription service for printing.\n\nLexmark's Cloud Print Management allows you to optimize your network printing and create an information edge with a solution through the cloud.  Send documents from your computer and print them on any supported Lexmark printer or Multifunction product (MFP). Instead of “pushing” your documents to a designated print device— where the pages sit out in public view until you retrieve them—you “pull” them down from the print queue when you log in or swipe your ID card at the printer. Instead of being tethered to a single device, you can release your print job from a printer that is most convenient to you or from one with the features or capabilities that best fits your needs.\n\nYour organization accesses the solution on a subscription basis. Lexmark manages and operates the system, along with the associated infrastructure, in our secure data center. This option enables you to maintain focus on your business, while Lexmark manages your Print Release solution and its architecture."
