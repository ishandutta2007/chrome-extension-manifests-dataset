Full Text Tabs Forever (FTTF) is a powerhouse tool for navigating your browsing history.\n\n**Doesn't Chrome do that already? How is this different?**\n\nChrome does not let you search the text on pages you've visited, only the URLs/titles, and it deletes your history after a number of months.\n\nFTTF is different:\n\n- **Full-Text Search Capabilities:** The full content of every page you've visited becomes searchable, ensuring that no piece of information ever slips through the cracks.\n    \n- **Permanent History:** Your digital footprints are yours to keep. Your data is yours, so it should not be removed without your approval. Nothing is deleted automatically.\n    \n- **Instant indexing:** FTTF creates a search index as you browse, so pages are immediately available for searching right after you land on a page.\n    \n- **For your eyes only:** Your browsing history is stored locally on your device, and not on any external servers. Beware that if you switch computers your FTTF history will not automatically come with you. It can be exported though.\n\n**Who is it for?**\n\nData hoarders like myself that never want to delete anything, and want everything to be searchable. More generally, if you've ever felt limited by the standard history search you should try this out.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nChrome extensions have access to the pages you visit, which lets FTTF make an index of the content on any page. When a page loads its content is extracted and indexed.\n\nExtracted? Yes, or \"distilled\" if you prefer. Full web pages are huge and have a lot of information that's not related to the content itself. FTTF will ignore all of that. It acts like \"reader mode\" to find relevant content on a page and only index that."
