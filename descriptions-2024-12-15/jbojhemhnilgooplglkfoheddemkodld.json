We do not spy, collect, steal, or sell your data.\n\nHow to Install Otto?\n\n- Click on the ‚ÄúAdd to Chrome/Brave‚Äù button.\n- Once installed, you‚Äôll see a welcome page with an overview.\n- Be sure to pin the extension. This is important because the timer is displayed in the extension when you start a session. If you don‚Äôt pin it, you may not see it.\n\nRemember to \"pin it\" ‚úÖ\n\nMain Features\n\nPomodoro Timer:\n\nSplit your time into manageable chunks. For example, work for 45 minutes and take a 5-minute break. After each work session, a break session begins. The timer recurs until you stop it.\n\nTask Timer:\n\nTask sessions let you name your tasks, they act as a way to remind you what your working on. They function differently from a pomodoro timer since they do not respect the work/break idea. You can add up to 3 tasks on the free version and unlimited tasks on the Pro version. The task timer also shows you a little pop with your tasks, which you can minimize. \n\n\nWebsite Blocker:\n\nBlock any website without any restrictions. You can add unlimited websites for free. Just go to the blocklist in otto‚Äôs popup and add your site. You can also go to a website and open ottos popup and block the site directly from there. \nThe block site will only be activated when a Pomodoro timer or task timer is running. This plays nicely into focus during work \n\nNotion Task Timers\nTurn your To-dos on Notion into Task sessions. You can create 4 days per day with a total duration of 80 min.\n\n\nAutoblock Websites:\n\nAutomatically block websites after spending a certain amount of time on them. For example, block YouTube after 1 minute. Useful for breaking habits. The free plan allows one autoblock.\n\n\nSounds:\n\nCustomize the sounds that play at the end of a Pomodoro session.\n\nNow how does Otto‚Äôs health and game mechanic works? \n\nHere‚Äôs a simple explanation\n\n- Focus is important, focus for 25 minutes or more and you gain 100+ health and a maple leaf\n- Get distracted and your health goes down by -10\n- If health goes to zero, then death comes\n- But death is not final, revive using 10 maple leaves\n\nSo remember - Collect maple leaves and restore Otto.\n\nComplete List of Features\n\n- Pomodoro Work/Break Timer\n- Block Unlimited Websites\n- Point-Based Reward System\n- Tasks (3 tasks, upto 15m duration, Pro)\n- Workflows (Pro)\n-  Basic Focus Insights \n- Notifications\n- Break Block (Block Websites during a break)\n- Sounds\n- Custom reminders (nudges)\n- Create and Manage Unlimited Tasks (Pro)\n- Sequence Task Mode (Pro)\n- Advanced Insights (Pro)\n- Unlimited Workflows (Pro)\n- Autoblock Websites (Pro)\n- Notion Task Timers Integration \n\nData Collection and Privacy\n\nWe take your privacy very very seriously.  We do not spy, collect, steal, or sell your data. That goes against our values of creating good software products and building trust with our users and customers. \n\nAll the data that is collect for visualization is stored in your browsers local storage and indexDB. It never leaves it!\n\nWe do collect events and page views using Google analytics. This will help us improve Otto. This is a list of data google analytics colelcts\n\n- how long people use the extension\n- the number of daily/weekly/monthly users\n- what part of the UI is most active (via GA events)\n\nIf you have any questions, bug reports or feature requests or just want to say hi?
