Volunteers welcome!)  If there are no funding or conflicts disclosures accessible for the abstract within PMC, the extension does not modify the PubMed page, so you might not notice any change. \n\nTry it:  After installing the Extension, go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274181 (copy this URL now)\n\nThis was a product of the Hacking iCorruption event at MIT Media Lab, April 2015, sponsored by the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics Institutional Corruption Lab.  Support was also provided by James E. Rogers College of Law, University of Arizona.
