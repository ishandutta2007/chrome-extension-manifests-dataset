With three different zooming modes.\n\n1) Shrink Only - Zoom is always at 100% unless window width is decreased and the contents are shrinked to fit, avoiding horizontal scrollbar (this is probably the expected behaviour for most of the users).\n\n2) Grow Only - Zoom level is never lower than 100% and it only grows for the contents to fit window width.\n\n3) Shrink and Grow - Contents are shrinked and growed to fit window width.\n\nIn addition to the zoom mode the user can choose which addresses he/she wants to exclude from being zoomed in/out. This option is available from options page and a faster and user-friendly context menu.\n\n\nFor more informations/support on this extension, its changes through releases and how to contact me please visit: https://github.com/JoaoPe/iZoom/wiki\n\nTo help translating it to your native language please check: https://github.com/JoaoPe/iZoom/wiki/Internationalization"
