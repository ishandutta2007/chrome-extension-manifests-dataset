Used on the growing website Pokernow.club for Texas Hold'em which allows people to play with their friends for home games, I may expand it to work with other popular sites in the future.\n\nGreat for people playing multiple games at once or trying to multitask while doing work. Also great for reducing amount of needless clicks for people with wrist tendon issues like myself.\n\n*Read the app's options menu for a detailed description."
