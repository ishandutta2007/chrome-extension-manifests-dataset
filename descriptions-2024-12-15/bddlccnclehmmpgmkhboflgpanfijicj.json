This way, you analyze only relevant and closely-related keywords, getting actual keyword volumes and difficulties, by default.\n\nThe PageExplorer browser extension helps you identify ranking opportunities, new questions and underutilized long tail keywords at a glance.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, you can optimize your\n\n- titles,\n- meta-tags,\n- headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) and\n- of course your content itself.\n\nIt allows you to rank higher and drive more traffic to your website.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n-----------------\n\nOnce youâ€™ve connected PageExplorer to your Google Search Console, it allows you to inspect each individual page on your website for\n\n- keywords it ranks for,\n- potential opportunities to increase your CTR and rank higher as well as\n- commonly asked questions (FAQ).\n\nThe images above help to visualize how it exactly works. With these insights, you are able to improve your ranking step by step. Naturally, this works especially well for long tail seo rankings.\n\n\nWho is it for?\n--------------\n\nThe PageExplorer extension works for both experienced as well as novice users. Basic understanding of SEO fundamentals helps a great deal, but this can also be acquired along the way. The extension offers tool-tips explaining abbreviations (see YouTube video).\n\nIf you are experienced in working with tools such as Ahrefs, Majestic, Moz or SEMrush, you will be able to start right off and get the most value from it. Thanks to the URL-based approach, you can find SEO insights which would get lost in the mass of data shown in the Google Search Console application.\n\nAbout PageExplorer\n-----------------\n\nA few words about my background. I'm Peter Thaleikis, a software engineer and maker who loves to build and optimize. SEO has become one of my favorite topics over the last few years. My technical background helps me a lot in this area and I hope to share the positives from it with others here.\n\nI hope this is useful for you and your project.
