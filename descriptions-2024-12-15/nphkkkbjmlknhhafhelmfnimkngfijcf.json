We've added all the important links we could find into a colourful little box, so you don't need to keep track of them.\n\nGet in touch if you think of any other links we should add in!\n\n**Update**\nWe've added the ability to choose options to this edition. You can now hide a number of the links to reduce the number shown, and you can add up to 4 custom links (maybe put in links to the lecture recordings of your units).\n\nWe've also added a short news feed to keep you up to date with Guild News!"
