The buyer does not leave their trade URL or other information from the steam. The buyer does not have to accept the trade in steam, he gets into the inventory himself, and our sellers do not receive reports on steam as on other popular sites. Our bots are not blocked for spam trades, and your skins are guaranteed not to be lost.\n\nThe browser extension is designed to automatically send a trade to steam when buying or selling a skin on the site skinswipe.ru . In order for the site to work with the browser extension, you need to reload the site page skinswipe.ru . The extension sends a trade via a request to steam at your partner's trade url opened from the website. All that remains for you is to wait for the other side to accept the trade."
