Right mouse button + left mouse button snap-zoom functionality is also available.\n\n*** FINALLY *** Chrome offers an official Zoom-API and starting with version 0.2.0, MouseZoom for Chrome is using it. Zooming should now be almost as enjoyable as on Firefox.\n\nIn case you're wondering: The \"OSD\", present in former versions of MouseZoom, has been removed. Instead, Chrome shows an \"info bubble\" that displays the current zoom level while zooming. Also, Chrome does not support changing the buit-in zoom-levels, so the option for changing those had to be removed as well."
