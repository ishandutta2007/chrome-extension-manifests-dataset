An estimated 10% of people have this disability.\n\nA study (http://dyslexiahelp.umich.edu/sites/default/files/good_fonts_for_dyslexia_study.pdf) has found that some fonts significantly aid readability for people with dyslexia. The researchers cited Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, CMU and Courier as the best fonts to improve readability.\n\nAside from Arial, these fonts are rarely used in website designs. To address this, lexia offers users the possibility to change the font of a webpage to one of the aforementioned fonts. As a Chrome extension, it is non-intrusive, and it helps improving users' experience browsing the web."
