To do so see the settings page below.\n\n- Ability to use a custom source (if you want to add append companies / people yourself). Read instructions on the options page on how to do so.\n\nAdjust Settings:\nPlease goto chrome://extensions, look for this plugin, and then click options. You can turn on highlighting the people who are investors/advisors to the 500.co portfolio companies and also set a custom source (optional).\n\nDemo: \n- Install the plugin.\n- Goto https://angel.co/forerunner-ventures\n- You should see the 500 companies that this VC firm invested in.\n\nNotes:\n- This works on company and investor pages right now. Doesn't work for ajax search results (yet)."
