What differentiates this extension from most common ad blockers is that it is purpose-built for the aforementioned application and unlike many other ad blockers it doesn't leave the leftover space where ads used to be by carefully adjusting the styles of remaining elements to fill the space. The extension creates a clean distraction-free environment without annoying blinking ads and commercials.\n\nThe extension is designed with memory efficiency in mind and leaves virtually no memory footprint once ads have been removed. For your peace of mind, it requires no client-side permissions and only gets activated on the new web mail interface. It lacks any extension configuration pages or popups and requires absolutely no interaction with the user. Once loaded it will simply keep the web-mail interface clean.\n\nChrome is a trademark of Google Inc.
