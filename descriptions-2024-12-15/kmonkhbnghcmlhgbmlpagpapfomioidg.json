Don't you hate it when bloggers or designers think that light grey text on a grey background is artistic?  Dude, hello?  It's practically invisible!  I'm trying to read your article here.... This Chrome extension installs a button labelled \"DT\" that you can click on to darken text inside <p> tags so that the text becomes more readable.  No instruction manuals.  Just a simple single click and it turns <p> tagged text to black.\n\n  I found that I'm using it all the time, so version 1.1 adds a keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+K (or COMMAND+SHIFT+K on Mac).  As of version 1.1 the text color of the following tags are turned to black:  <p>, <div>, <li>, <article>.  Hope this helps you guys.  Email me if you have any features requests.  I'll make the DT Chrome Extension do anything you want except wipe your butt.  You'll have to ask your mommy to do that for you.\n\n  BTW, feel free to email me if you need a programmer.  I'm a freelance web developer.\n\n  Cheers!\n  David :)\nthirdreplicator@gmail.com\nhttp://www.davidbeckwith.com"
