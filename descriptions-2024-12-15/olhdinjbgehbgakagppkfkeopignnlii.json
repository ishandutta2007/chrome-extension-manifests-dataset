MEC manages the process of sending surveys to customers, with each survey assigned a unique survey ID. Users often need to \"unpack\" a survey ID to view its metadata, which typically requires manually copying the ID and pasting it into another webpage. This extension streamlines that process, allowing users to effortlessly unpack any survey ID either by right-clicking and selecting \"unpack survey\" or by using the extension button in the taskbar. Additionally, with version 2.0, users can also now search Emails directly on broadcaster. \n\nNew in Version 2.0:\n\n----Search on Broadcaster Functionality----\n\nUsers can now right-click on email addresses within supported pages and use the new \"Search on Broadcaster\" feature.\n\nThis option allows users to search for emails across different data centers, providing more flexibility in locating information quickly.\n\nThe context menu adapts based on the selected text and URL, making it more intuitive for the user."
