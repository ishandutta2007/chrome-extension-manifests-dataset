You start reading an interesting blog post that you accidentally found on your favorite social network, but this post is filled with links, a LOT of links. Before you know it you have 10 tabs open and now you have to catch up on reading these 10 articles which themselves link to other interesting articles...\n\nThat's how you can waste a full day, by just reading stuff instead of making stuff.\n\nThis chrome extension will help you stay focused and productive by removing all the links from the page that you are reading. Once you have finished reading the article, you can just close that tab and go back to working.\n\nIcon made by Dave Gandy from http://www.flaticon.com which is licensed under  Creative Commons BY 3.0 - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"
