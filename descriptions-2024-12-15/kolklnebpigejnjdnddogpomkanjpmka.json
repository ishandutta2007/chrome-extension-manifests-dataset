It works by searching the HTML source of pages at \"*://canvas.vt.edu/*\" for the SPOT survey box and the dark gray content overlay, and once they are loaded, those two elements are removed.  Once the extension is installed, there is no further action required to make this extension work as long as it is enabled."
