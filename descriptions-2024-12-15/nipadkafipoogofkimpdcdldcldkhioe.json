You snippet with the website link will be saved in the local storage of the browser. \n\nTo view your snipped texts you can click on the extension (Top Right corner in the browser) and \"Go to snippet list\". \n\nCurrently the app does not provide a way to \"sync\" the data between multiple browsers or devices however that is currently on a todo as a feature. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Also note, that by deleting the browser history / cache will cause you to loose saved snippets a way to mitigate this is in the works."
