For example, can you tell the difference between these URLs:\n\nwww.google.com/maps\nwww.google.com⁄maps\nwww.google.com∕maps\n\nOnly one of these links is using real slashes, and some fonts may make them even harder to distinguish. Sophisticated replacement of characters which look similar is used to harvest login details, or fool users into accessing fake websites or downloading malicious files.\n\nOnce installed, this chrome extension will:\n1. Highlight and disable links which contains fake slashes, preventing you from clicking them accidentally.\n2. Safely redirect you away from any URLs which contain fake slashes."
