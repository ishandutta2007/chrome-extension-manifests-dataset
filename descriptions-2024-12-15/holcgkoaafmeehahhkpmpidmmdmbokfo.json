Trainn lets us record videos and add speech in a jiffy. The Video engagement data helps us understand how the videos are fairing\n‚Äî Rwiddha Mitra, HackerRank\n\nüèÜ For the first time, our product team is not perturbed by the thought of making a product video. It brings in a layer of professionalism that we require and enables us to seamlessly merge the video with the subtitles to make it feel rehearsed and effortless.\n‚Äî Nikhil G, Limechat\n\nüèÜOur customers always ask for quick 1-minute tutorial videos to learn the product. It took exactly 45 days to create over 100 tutorial videos, review, and publish the Learning Center on Trainn. \n‚Äî Sabina Rana I Dangal, Head of Support, BuildOps\n\nüèÜThe best feature is that you can auto-translate a single video into multiple languages.\n‚Äî Shambhavi Pandey, Manager, RestroWorks Academy (previous Posist)\n\nüèÜWe needed a tool to easily create training and support videos in multiple languages despite our English-only support staff.
