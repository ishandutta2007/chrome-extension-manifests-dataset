Green means that you are a developer and that cookies will be set for this domain, gray means you are not. This preference is saved and this extension will try to always keep a cookie set for that domain.\n\nThe \"name\" and \"value\" of the cookie that gets created can (and should) be customized to be unique to you or your organization.\n\nA list of all of your active domains can be found on the Options page, where domains can be easily added or removed as needed. There is also a button here to clear any cookies that have been saved on your device. Right-click the Developer Cookie Icon in your browser and select \"Options\" to access this page any time. Alternatively, you can find a link to this page in your Extensions manager.\n\n\n••• How to Use •••\n\nIn your scripts, check for this cookie before performing certain actions.\n\nJavaScript example:\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n var devCookie = \"ChromeDeveloperCookie=123\";\n if (document.cookie.indexOf(devCookie) !== -1) {\n    // I am a developer\n    // Show control panel, debug info, etc.\n } else {\n    // I am NOT a developer\n    // Insert Google Analytics code here, etc.\n }\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nPHP example:\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n $devCookie = @$_COOKIE[\"ChromeDeveloperCookie\"];\n if ($devCookie === \"123\") {\n     // I am a developer\n     // Show control panel, debug info, etc.\n } else {\n     // I am NOT a developer\n     // Insert Google Analytics code here, etc.\n }\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\n••• Notes About Cookies •••\n\nOn your next visit to any of the domains in your list, a new developer cookie will be created if one does not already exist (assuming this extension is enabled). New cookies are set to expire after 30 days. To keep your cookies up-to-date, a check is done when this extension is started (often at the opening of a new browsing session) and the expiration date of all active domains is renewed. However, for many reasons it is possible that even with this extension enabled you could load the page as a public user (once every 30 days or as often as your cookies are cleared). These cookies are very helpful, but please do not rely on this method of identification to be bulletproof.\n\nActivating a domain applies to all pages on that domain, so clicking the icon while viewing any page on \"http://www.example.com/\" will cause your cookie to be set for all of the following:\n\n- http://www.example.com/page1.html\n- http://www.example.com/subfolder/page2.html\n- http://example.com/page1.html\n- and so on...\n\nHowever, cookies set for \"example.com\" will NOT be present on \"beta.example.com\" and vice versa. Each new sub-domain can be added or removed with a single click.\n\nWARNING: This method of identification is not secure and should not be used to replace a user log-in system. Do not display secure data based on this cookie."
