Now, for your convenience, these improvements are also available as a Chrome extension!\n\nThe intent of SOUP is not to make any substantial or controversial changes to the Stack Exchange user interface, but to fix minor problems and omissions that the SE developers have overlooked or haven't got around to fixing yet. By combining these minor patches into a single user script, they become easier to install and maintain.\n\nSee the linked Stack Apps page (and the Github project) for more information on the specific fixes included in SOUP."
