If you want to be removed from or added to the online phone listings, you can contact the webmaster who runs the site to put your request into effect. \n\nThe online white pages directory is not only for personal listings, but it is also used for business listings. Known also as the business white pages, this is a good way for a bank or financier to verify the legitimacy of a business. If the business is not listed, it will raise suspicion. \n\nSearch engines too can be used as white pages directories where you enter the phone number or name of a person in the search box. The limitation is that you will get so many and digging through the maze of listings might be overwhelming."
