That’s what we are trying to find out with World Wide Walls, an experimental Google Chrome Extension allowing anyone to leave their mark on any public website. What started as an internal playful exercise, quickly turned into a collective social experiment in nonlinear expression and asynchronous communication. Some would say it’s digital vandalism, we call it radical self-expression — while trying to make a point in the age of a tightly constrained creative space, we give web users the freedom to break out of the pixel matrix. The Google Chrome Extension was developed by oio — a creative company on a mission to turn emerging technologies into an approachable, everyday and sustainable reality."
