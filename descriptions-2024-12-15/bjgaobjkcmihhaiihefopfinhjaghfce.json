Higher bars mean higher response times. If the request timed out it shows a red bar.\n\nHow can I interpret these response times?\nIf the bars are about the same height it is a sign for a healthy internet connection/server load. If there are red lines and blue lines mixed up or the chart is very volatile your internet connection is unstable or the server is overloaded. If it shows only red something is terribly wrong ...\n\nWhy does this need permission to \"Your data on all websites\"?\nTo perform checks to a user specific URL it is required that the extension can send requests to 'all websites'."
