Maybe you're the newbie on the team or perhaps you just don't want to pay attention; either way, you just find yourself giving every task a score of'?'. \n\nReviewing 50 tasks? That's 50 manual clicks that could have been spent on checking your schedule for when the meeting is supposed to end, and a lot of attention that you have to pay just to ensure that you're not always the last person that everyone is waiting on to vote. So why not just automate the clicking? By default, this extension will automatically pick '?' for you as soon as voting starts.\n\nWant to automatically pick another card instead of '?'... for whatever reason? It can do that too.\n\nWant to automatically pick a random card? I'm not really sure why you'd really need that functionality, but if you really desire an inefficient RNG, then this extension be that inefficient RNG for you too.\n\nThe extension has a couple of other (useless... but also spicy?) tricks up its sleeve, so stop wasting your time on manually clicking '?'; have this extension do it for you so that you can pay even less attention to your meeting that you don't understand and are barely participating in anyways."
