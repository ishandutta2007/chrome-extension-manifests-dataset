This was added due to user feedback to the NSLR tool option, placing its data in a more considerate location.\n\n%UPDATE 0.0.4%:\nAdded ability for users to enable integration with NSLR (National Speed Limit Register), when mousing over the road wait 2 seconds and it will ping the NSLR servers a request at your current coordinates. Details around this are shown on the bottom left of your screen.\n--Currently working on implementing my own API to a database that will hold all TMCs details and will display their details based on what road / area your in. This data will be community driven, please share information if you have any :)\n\n%UPDATE 0.0.3%:\nUpdated newly created SH1C and  SH1N due to Hamilton Bypass.\nBegan update of TMC details when overlaying roads.\n\n%UPDATE 0.0.2%:\nThis update brings minor changes on SH1K and SH1P (SH1P is OLD SH1N, NZTA is still looking after the road and we've been told that its still Level 2 (Was showing as Level 1).\nSH1K-0012 and 0023 Were Level 2 but the NZTA Public Map now shows both as Level 1 (Now states Level 1)"
