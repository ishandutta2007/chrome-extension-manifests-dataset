If there are 10 or fewer possible answers, it will show them to you.\n\n# Privacy Policy\n\n## Privacy Policy\nThank you for using our Chrome extension, \"Wordle Hint\". This Privacy Policy outlines how our extension collects and handles data to provide its services. Your privacy and trust are important to us, and we are committed to ensuring the security and confidentiality of your information.\n\n## Data Collection and Usage\nOur Chrome extension, \"Wordle Hint\", collects guesses made by the user within the Wordle game page. This data is utilized solely for the purpose of generating the next hint to aid the user in their gameplay experience. The collection process is strictly local, occurring entirely within the client's web browser environment.\n\n## Data Storage and Security\nWe do not store or transmit any collected data to external servers or third-party entities. All data processing and computation are conducted locally on the user's device. This approach ensures that your data remains private and secure, minimizing any potential exposure to external threats.\n\nFurthermore, the collected data is not stored locally after a game session is complete. Once the browser window is closed, any temporarily stored data related to the gameplay is automatically cleared from the user's device. This ensures that no residual data from previous sessions is retained beyond the immediate gameplay session.\n\n## User Consent and Permissions\nBy installing and using our Chrome extension, you consent to the collection and processing of data as described in this Privacy Policy. The extension requires permission to access and read the contents of the Wordle game page in order to function effectively. Rest assured, we do not access any additional personal information beyond what is necessary for the extension's intended purpose."
