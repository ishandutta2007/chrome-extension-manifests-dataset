This is especially useful for developers who run their web applications on many different environments and who are constantly switching between a dev, test, and production version of an app or database.  Because the application may look the same on all environments, it's easy to accidentally do something on the production environment that shouldn't have been done.  \n\nWith URL Colors, you can easily have the browser flag important websites for you by specifying a the keyword to match against the tab url, the border color, width, opacity, whether or not the border should blink, and the interval of blinking.  The wildcard character (*) is now supported.\n\nIt also has a demo mode, or snooze mode, so you can shut if off while presenting for a specified period of time, without worrying about reactivating it later.  It automatically turns back on for you!\n\nWant to add functionality or tweak something?
