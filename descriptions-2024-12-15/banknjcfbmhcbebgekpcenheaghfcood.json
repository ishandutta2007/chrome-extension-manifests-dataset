One potential use case for Clear Links is to make you more easily aware of phishing email scams by allowing you to inspect a link's destination domain and allowing you to check if the destination is as expected -- identifying malicious links.\n\nIt is important to note that this extension does not identify malicious links for you, instead, it informs you of links to external sites so you can make the decision yourself. By default, links to pages within the same website/hostname do not have a tooltip appear. This can be changed in the Options menu.\n\nThis will make a fine addition to your security and privacy digital toolbelt.\n\nShort URL services supported:\ngoo.gl, bit.ly, j.mp, t.co (partially)\n\nCode repository and release notes can be viewed on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/ChristopherBull/Clear-Links/\n\nKeywords:\nURL, link, domain, hostname, Short URL, URL expander, URL expansion"
