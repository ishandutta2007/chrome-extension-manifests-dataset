It adds a random background image and the current local (workstation) time. It's designed to be a beautiful and informative display. Click the background to hide WTB and show the background only, or right-click the background to change it to a new random background. (Photos courtesy of picsum.photos and Unsplash).\n\nNote: This extension does nothing on its own - it requires World Time Buddy, and removes functionality from the standard WTB interface. You should configure WTB (select cities/timezones, etc.) before turning on this extension. When you need to make changes to WTB again, turn off this extension to get the full WTB UI back. (If there's interest, future versions may include built in on/off functionality.)\n\n(If you are the creator of World Time Buddy, please contact me - I love your product and would love to talk to you about it!)"
