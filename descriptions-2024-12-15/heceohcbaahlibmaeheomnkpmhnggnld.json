This extension lets you embrace your grumpy side by redacting (blacking out) all emoji characters as you browse.\n\nJust click the Emoji Censor icon to turn censoring on or off. While it's on, you'll see a count of how many pesky emoji have been removed from your vision.\n\nThe code is open source at https://github.com/gilmoreorless/emoji-censor, and is also available as a web page with audio censoring at https://gilmoreorless.github.io/emoji-censor/\n\n(You could even install it together with the Emoji Translate extension and black out half the web! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoji-translate/kkkfndlpdajmbgofkidemhkjoinhmojl )"
