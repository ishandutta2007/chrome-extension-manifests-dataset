The browser does have access to your entire browse history, it just chooses not to show it, often prioritising the wrong results, or adding suggested search terms just when you don't need them.\n\nTo activate OmniHistoryPlus, go to the omnibar & simply type 'f' followed by a tab or space, then type what you want to search for. Results are displayed in the omnibar, but you'll find they go beyond what it normally displays, letting to get to the results you want!\n\nBehind the scenes, this extension isn't doing anything fancy.. it's calling Chrome's native APIs to search your full browser history, but it'll not end up adding anything else, like search suggestions, open tabs, or bookmarks, which should give you what you're looking for.\n\nOmniHistoryPlus is a great alternative to Fauxbar, which unfortunately didn't survive the move to Manifest v3 & removal of WebSQL. Fauxbar did an excellent job of surfacing your browse history, and OmniHistoryPlus does the same, so give this replacement a go!"
