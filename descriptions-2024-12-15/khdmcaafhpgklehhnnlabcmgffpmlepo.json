I try to stay ahead and be up to date with the news coming from these fields and share them with my friends. On my site you will find a vast majority of articles debating these subjects.\n\nAfter working for more than 10 years as a graphic designer for a big media corporation, I’ve decided to let everything behind me and live a more simple and self-sufficient life. I’m currently a freelancer and a prepper (or prepper- learner as my wife used to say).\n\nI’ve started this site as an information support for my friends and family but also to help my fellow Americans learn more about what it takes to make it out there in the eventuality of SHTF."
