We will use that feedback to improve our model and provide better hints in the future.\n\nWe've also been building a custom hint database to train our data on, so we hope you enjoy the more fine tuned hints!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs current students at Columbia, weâ€™ve seen a big problem - interviewing for SWE jobs is really tough! Many students, including ourselves, use Leetcode for interview prep, but immediately become confused + demoralized when we have no idea where to start for a problem. So our solution is BeetCode, which is a browser extension that integrates directly with Leetcode. Once activated, it provides a hint for you, based on the code that you've written so far. BeetCode does not directly offer the solution, but rather guides the user and helps them build their critical thinking skills. We hope this tool will help with your SWE technical interviews and are open to any comments/suggestions.\n\nIf you want to give more specific feedback on our tool, please fill out this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK7QyHFhButG8FReHagob-SGvVb4O6zF35lT3DtjSWg9UJ0g/viewform?usp=sf_link"
