Available commands so far: \n♦Click, \n♦Open link in new tab and go\n♦Add link to list; and\n♦Open links in list.  \nThis extension will free you from the use of the mouse and will allow you a better experience navigating the web.\n\nI haven't use a pointer device to use my windows 7 \n computer for the last ten years and it has been really fantastic to command every application with just the keyboard. And now I'm interpolating that to the web.\n\nAdding links you want to visit later to a list (which is actually a hack for \"open links in new tab and keep focus on the current one\", since chrome no longer supports simulating mouse events) is one of my favorite features because keeps you in your current flow while keeping track of what you want to visit later."
