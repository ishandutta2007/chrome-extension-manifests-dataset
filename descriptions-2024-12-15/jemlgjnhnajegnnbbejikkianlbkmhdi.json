You end up with multiple carts and browser tabs, wish lists on different sites or apps, and a never ending number of screenshots in your camera roll... This is where Lilo comes in.\n‍\nBorn out of frustration of forever losing track of items online and having wish lists saved everywhere, Lilo is a free plugin that allows you to easily save and share shopping items from any website, all in one place. And from that one place, you can share your wish list with friends for advice – create a handy guide for your boyfriend before your birthday, wink wink – or keep track of everything you'd like to buy, easily and simply."
