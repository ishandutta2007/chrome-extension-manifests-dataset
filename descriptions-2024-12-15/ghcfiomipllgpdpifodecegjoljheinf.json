Everytime you play a game of Dominion, LogDog will constantly keep track of the Log for you and store it locally in Chrome (the logs are not synched between computers! You can move your logs between computers using the backup functions from the options page).\n\nNow you can come back to your logs anytime in a manner of seconds and save them on your computer to do some fancy analysis yourself or copy them for use in other apps like Windominion.com.\n\nJust click on the LogDog logo next to your adress bar on the right to get access to all your stored logs, filter for players and dates as well as rerun a match against a bot or another player by reloading the kingdom as a new game.\n\nGo to \"More Options\" or right-click on the extension and select \"options\" to Access the options page. There you can again filter for certain players or dates, backup and restore your logs and also view all your logs as in the popup, and change the behaviour of LogDog.\n\nThe source code for log dog is hosted on github (https://www.github.com/michaelgoetze/LogDog"
