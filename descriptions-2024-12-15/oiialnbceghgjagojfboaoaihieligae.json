All the data is stored encrypted with your key. I'm using AES encryption so its impossible to crack your passwords. Also since the original passwords automatically and randomly generated, its even more hard to decrypt.\n\nI'm planning to extend this project into a cross platform application that lets you store your passwords even for your desktop application and maybe even mobile apps. \n\nWhen I searched for a open-source multi-platform password manager I couldn't find anything that satisfies me. For me, an extension is essential since auto-filling is important. So I decided to make my own. \n\nCoded extension, zipped and bom. We're in the chrome extensions. In my free time I'm going to make a desktop application too that will be in sync with extension via your own google drive. You will be able to sync your encrypted passwords between your computers and applications so you will be able to use your game password to login into game's website and even more.\n\nHere is the github link:\nhttps://github.com/eeren3411/YAPM-by-Eeren-Extension"
