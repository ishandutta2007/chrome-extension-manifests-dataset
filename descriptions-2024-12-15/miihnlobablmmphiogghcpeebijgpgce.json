This extension works by actively & locally redacting potentially sensitive information before it's sent to ChatGPT for processing, including names, addresses, API keys, Ethereum addresses, JWT tokens, etc.\n\nThe Chainstack DLP tool employs regular expression patterns to detect potentially sensitive data and redacts this data in real time as you type it. This entire process is conducted locally, ensuring the information in question never leaves your machine. Additionally, this extension has been made open-source at https://github.com/chainstacklabs/chainstack-dlp-browser-extension"
