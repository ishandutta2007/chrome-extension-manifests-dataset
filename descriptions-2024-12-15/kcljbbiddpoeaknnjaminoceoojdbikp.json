Drag in a video, record an interview, snap a selfie, write text posts or upload some documents, and voilà! \n\nPadlet is different from other blogging tools and inspiration boards because it’s flexible. Create a grocery list, a Venn diagram, a discussion board, a group greeting card, a portfolio, or a business plan, all in one app. Used by teachers, students, professionals, and individuals of all ages, all around the world, padlets can be selectively shared and edited among multiple contributors. \n\nSee an example padlet: http://padlet.com/about/us\n\nWHY SHOULD I USE PADLET?\n\n1. Padlets are shareable. So, instead of collecting links about your next vacation alone, you can collect it together with your better half. Hoard together!\n\n2. You can keep everything in one place. Once you have collected your links, you can add text notes, upload files to the same padlet. An example: upload your train tickets to the same padlet that has an article about the city you’ll be visiting. Oh, and maybe write a travel journal as you go.\n\n3. Padlets are beautiful. Make a padlet yours by choosing custom backgrounds, themes, and building your profile."
