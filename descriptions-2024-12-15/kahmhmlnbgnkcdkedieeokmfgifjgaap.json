Clicking on the toolbar icon, renders messenger.com in a small UI attached to the toolbar popup. Moreover, you will get badge notification for all incoming messages.\n\nImportant Note: Messenger & Notifier for Facebook™ does NOT belong or related to the official Facebook or Messenger web application or website at all. It is basically an unofficial extension that is developed and maintained independently. The official www.messenger.com website and web-app is only released for smart-phones and the web. This unofficial extension is a wrapper to the original messenger.com web-app and tries to make it usable as a browser extension.\n\nSome important features:\n1. A comprehensive Messenger client right in your browser's toolbar.\n2. Notifies you every time something happens on messenger.com within the people you follow via badge-icon text.\n3. Features all messenger.com functions in a customizable UI (see Options page).\n4. Options page has few settings to adjust including badge-icon text color.\n\nNote 1: after installing the addon and before opening the UI (toolbar popup) please log-in to www.messenger.com via a Browser Tab. For some reason, the log-in page does NOT work from toolbar-popup UI.\n\nNote 2: in order to submit bugs, please go to the addon's homepage (http://mybrowseraddon.com/facebook-messenger.html) and fill the Bug report form."
