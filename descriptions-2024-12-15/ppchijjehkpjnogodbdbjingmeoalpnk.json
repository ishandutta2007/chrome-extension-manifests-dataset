We take your privacy into consideration by keeping everything we can offline. \n\nWe do not need access to any of your data and the QR code is generated offline using an open-source JavaScript library. \n\nThe short URLs are created using shp.zone API's. (This is the only thing done over the network) but no personal data is collected.\n\nIcons by HeroIcons\nhttps://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs"
