Now, Google automatically sets new keywords as \"Broad\" match, and if you want \"Exact\" or \"Phrase\" match, you have to add extra symbols manually each time, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nOur Google Ads extension addresses this issue. It allows you to:\n→ Choose the match type for each keyword individually when adding matched search terms.\n→ Change the match type for all matched terms in bulk before adding them.\n\nThis makes the process faster and reduces the likelihood of mistakes. \n\nOur extension works on your device and does not send your data to external servers or third parties."
