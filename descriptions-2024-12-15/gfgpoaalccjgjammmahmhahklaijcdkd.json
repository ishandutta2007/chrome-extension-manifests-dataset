This approach ensures test stability, even when UI elements change frequently, reducing maintenance work. The selectors are customizable, providing flexibility for more complex test cases.\n\n- Cucumber Integration: Boozang integrates natively with Cucumber, allowing teams to use Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices easily. You can import, run, and manage Cucumber feature files directly within Boozang. The tool supports data-driven Cucumber tests, automating multiple scenarios with different data sets for comprehensive testing. Boozang simplifies test step implementation and offers visual feedback for debugging, making BDD more efficient and accessible to non-technical stakeholders.\n\n- Model-Based Testing (Digital Twin): Boozang automates test creation by scanning your application and generating a virtual model (digital twin), drastically reducing the manual effort needed for test creation and maintenance. As the application evolves, Boozang updates the tests automatically by re-scanning the model, ensuring that your tests stay in sync with application changes.\n\nAdditional benefits include scriptless test creation through a recorder, rapid test execution, API testing capabilities, and cross-platform support. Boozang is designed to make test automation accessible, stable, and efficient, perfect for teams looking to streamline their testing process without requiring advanced programming skills.\n\nOverall, Boozang provides a complete and adaptive testing solution that simplifies automation, increases test reliability, and reduces maintenance efforts, making it a valuable tool for modern web testing."
