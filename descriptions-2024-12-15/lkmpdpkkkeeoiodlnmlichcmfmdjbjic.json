So, when you click through to a retailer advertised on our site or browser extension, we're in effect acting as an advertising agent for the retailer by sending it online customers and traffic. In return for this, the retailer (and its tracking agency) pays us commission. It's this commission that we pay to you as cash back.\n\nWhy do we do this?\n\nBecause we hope to gain your loyalty and repeat business to continue building an even bigger and better site. We're proud to say we've already built up a hugely successful U.S. site and brand, which means we're currently earning and passing on to you the highest levels of cash back available.\n\nPlease see our Privacy Policy at: https://www.topcashback.com/Privacy"
