Trello has tried to address this with integrations that support common applications like Google Docs, Github, and Invision but what happens when you want a easily referenced sticky link that isn't supported by Trello PowerUps.  We've solved this in the past usually means creating a new list in your board just for references, but it's kind of a distracting graveyard.\n\nTrello Topics provide an alternative solution.  Create unlimited topics that link out to project-related resources, all with the native feel of Trello.\n\nThis extension is new and under active development.  If you have feedback or feature requests, please visit our public Trello board below!\n\nhttps://trello.com/b/a3Bcrkpe/feedback-and-feature-roadmap"
