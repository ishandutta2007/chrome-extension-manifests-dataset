Remove Shorts does so by completely blocking YouTube Shorts and giving the option to block YouTube entirely. As YouTube Shorts are addicting and can often destroy productivity, this extension offers a seamless way to save time by blocking access to these shorts. \nThe Toggle Block Youtube feature which gives users the option to completely block all Youtube URLs, is perfect for focusing on an important task. However, whenever you need a relaxing break, just turn off the feature and you can access Youtube again.\n\nFor the source code for this project visit this URL: \nhttps://github.com/Nathan6006/Remove-Shorts-Source-Code"
