Also, you can smoothly add someone to your digital agency management CRM whenever they email you to get your service. Engage instantly and keep track of the stages they are now. \n\nYou may offer SEO or digital marketing services, software development, UI/UX design, offshore software development, or any other type of digital services; OneSuite's CRM Chrome Extension to grab the leads will help you a lot. \n\n\nðŸ”¥ How it works?\nDownload the OneSuite Google Chrome Extension from the Chrome App Store. \nIf you are logged in to your OneSuite account, it will log you automatically. Otherwise, you must log in to your OneSuite account using the same Google Chrome.\n\nðŸ•µ Then, you will see a button down right called \"Add to OneSuite.\" Click on it to take all the information - the contacts' names, email addresses, and pictures. If you want, you can edit the name and email. \n\nYou can select the business if you have multiple companies in OneSuite. You need to choose the lead stages. Other fields like lead source and tags are optional. \n\nHit the Save Contact button, and you are done! \nYour new business opportunity is in your OneSuite CRM account. \n\nAdd reminders, follow up tasks, and assign to any sales or marketing executive with a deadline. You can do it all from OneSuite. \n\n\nðŸ’¥ Why OneSuite?\nAs a digital agency owner, you have to wear multiple hats. \n\nYou realize you need to log in to different apps to manage leads & clients. You log in to another app to manage your projects & teams. You may log in to another distinct app to manage the NDA, proposals, contracts, or invoices! \n\nIt shouldn't be this way, and it gets worse when you need to manage more than one business. Existing tools are either too expensive, too complex, or too confusing. That is why I built OneSuite together with more than 60 digital agency owners & CXO. As a frustrated digital agency owner myself, I wanted to solve this problem and wanted something that would save me time from juggling from one app to another. \n\nIt's time to dust off the old way of managing your digital agency. It's time to bring back the focus to your business, not the various tools & apps. With OneSuite, you will get a better, easier, and more practical way of running your business. We hope that you find it helpful and partner with us as we aim to make it better with your feedback and help. Join our private Facebook & Discord Community for faster support and replies and to join other digital agency owners like yourself. Please take a look at our public roadmap to see what we are working on as we aim to make OneSuite better every day. Thanks again for your partnership, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n\nFor more info:\nEmail: getonesuite@gmail.com\nWebsite: https://onesuite.io\nPrivacy Policy: https://onesuite.io/privacy-policy-2"
