So why do we refer to them as old jobs? If all 10 are considered old, how can we determine which ones are genuinely new on Upwork❓\n\n✨ Great question: We consider a job to be new if it appears in your job feed within two refreshes. This means any job you see after two refreshes is considered old. A job is classified as new if it appears in your feed for the first time during those refreshes. After being visible for two additional refreshes, it is marked as old.\n\n🔄 With each refresh, you see 10 jobs. Among these, Upwork adds new jobs that you haven’t seen before in your feed. These are what we classify as new jobs.\n💡 For example:\n👉 If 5 of the 10 are new, we label them as '5 New Jobs', while the remaining 5 are considered old.\n👉 Similarly, if 2 are new, we classify them as '2 New Jobs' and the other 8 as old.\n\n🧠 Understanding How Audio Messages Work❓\n\n🎉We offer two types of audio messages:\n1: Total Number of New Jobs Available on Upwork.\n2: Keyword-specific job alerts: You’ll receive an audio notification when Your selected keywords are found in job descriptions, such as 'Figma Job Available,' 'WordPress Job Available,' 'Webflow Job Available,' 'Digital Marketing Job Available,' and other similar phrases based on your preferences. 📝\n\n✨ Top 10 Features of \"Upwork Dream Job\"\n💼🌟 Your go-to tool for finding your dream jobs on Upwork\n\n👉 1 Real-Time Job Detection: Tracks new vs. old jobs in your feed based on two refreshes.\n👉 2 Job Feed Monitoring: Continuously monitors and counts new jobs after each refresh.\n👉 3 Visual Job Alerts: Displays labels like \"5 New Jobs\" to highlight new opportunities.\n👉 4 Audio Job Alerts: Customizable audio notifications for new job postings.\n👉 5 Keyword-Specific Notifications: Get alerts for jobs that match keywords like \"WordPress\", \"Webflow\", \"Figma\", \"Amazon\", \"Digital Marketing\" and more, as you want.\n👉 6 Smart Job Categorization: Classifies jobs as new if they appear within two refreshes.\n👉 7 Auto Refresh Updates: Automatically refreshes to update the job list.\n👉 8 Custom Keyword Tracking: Set your own keywords for tailored notifications.\n👉 9 Visual & Audio Integration: Combines visual cues with audio alerts.\n👉 10 Upwork Integration: Direct integration with Upwork job feed for accurate tracking.\n\n💡 Our Mission: 🔍 📚 📈 💰 💼\nAt Upwork Dream Job, our mission is to revolutionize the way freelancers discover and secure opportunities on Upwork.
