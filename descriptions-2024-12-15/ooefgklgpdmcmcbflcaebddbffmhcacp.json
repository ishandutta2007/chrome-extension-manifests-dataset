With the Universal Picture in Picture extension, you can play all these sites and more in Picture-in-Picture mode. Anybody can contribute to the library of websites that are supported; all it takes is the target domain (ex: www.youtube.com) and the CSS selector pointing to the video (ex: #container video), and everybody with this extension installed can use Picture-in-Picture mode for the website at that domain. The extension is secure and doesn't run Google Analytics to spy on you, unlike some official options. The most important thing about this extension is that it is community-built, unlike many other extensions, which come bundled with a few websites supported and no updates for more obscure websites (one favorite of mine is southpark.cc.com)."
