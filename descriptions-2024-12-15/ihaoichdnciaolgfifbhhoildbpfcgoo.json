The A-F rating will tell you at a glance whether you can trust them with your data when being asked to create an account, add a credit card, or share any other data that might put them at risk. \n\nThe rating displays as an icon in the Chrome toolbar and on the website itself. With the SecurityScorecard Chrome Extension you can:\n• Gain a better understanding of the cybersecurity risk for any company you visit on the web\n• See grades for websites when doing a Google search\n• See grades for websites from within Gmail\n\nThe SecurityScorecard Ratings extension allows cybersecurity-conscious consumers and professionals to easily and quickly view the cybersecurity grade for any website they visit.\n\nWith the SecurityScorecard Ratings Chrome extension you can see the rating for a site you are visiting both in an icon in the Chrome bar or on the website itself. SecurityScorecard's cybersecurity ratings are an easy to understand A-F grade scale. Companies with an F grade are 7.7 times more likely to experience a data breach than companies with an A.\n\nIn addition to showing you the grades for a website you visit, the SecurityScorecard Ratings Chrome extension can also show you the grades for a website you are about to visit. Grades can be added to Google.com and to Gmail inboxes to let you know the grade for a link before you even click it.\n\nCustomize the SecurityScorecard Ratings Chrome extension by turning on-page ratings on or off, turning Google.com ratings on or off, and turning Gmail link ratings on or off.\n\nRead more about our ratings at https://trust.securityscorecard.com"
