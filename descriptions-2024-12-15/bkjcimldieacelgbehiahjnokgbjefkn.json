It wonâ€™t actually change the news, but it might help you cope.\n\nIf you like it, take a screenshot of the news and share it on your social media. Tweet it (maybe at Mr Drumpf himself!). Instagram it. Go nuts.\n\nDrumpfworthy is free to download and use. If it brings you joy and you want to give something back, consider donating to a good cause. Here are a couple of links with lists of organizations that can use your support in these troubled times:\n\nhttp://time.com/money/4566160/trump-election-charities-donate/\n\nhttps://www.inverse.com/article/23698-john-oliver-donate-trump-list-president\n\nhttp://www.wmagazine.com/story/progressive-organizations-that-need-your-support-now-more-than-ever-in-trumps-america\n\nStay safe.\n\n**This extension is an adaptation of the excellent Downworthy extension (http://downworthy.snipe.net/). It does not reflect the views of its original creators, who were not involved with this version in any way. We thank them for their hard work in creating the original code and making it available!**"
