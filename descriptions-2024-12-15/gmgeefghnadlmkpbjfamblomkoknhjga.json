If a valid DNSSEC chain to the domain is found it will also check for the existence of TLSA records. TLSA records can store hashes of remote server TLS/SSL certificates. The authenticity of a TLS/SSL certificate for a domain name is verified by DANE protocol (RFC 6698). DNSSEC and TLSA validation results are displayer by using several icons. Additional explanatory texts are shown in the pageâ€™s address bar. Clicking on a given icon symbol reveals more detailed security information.\n\nIMPORTANT! This add-on communicates with an external binary application through the native messaging interface. The binary application is required for correct working of the add-on. The binary can be downloaded from www.dnssec-validator.cz/pages/download.html#package. Keep in mind that the version of the binary and of the extension must match."
