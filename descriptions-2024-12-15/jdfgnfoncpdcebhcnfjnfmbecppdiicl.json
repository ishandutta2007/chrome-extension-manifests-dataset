The player can control the snake's direction by using the arrow keys. As the snake eats apple, its body grows longer, making it more challenging to navigate through the board without running into something. \n\nTo boost the game's excitement, we've set the snake to move fast right from the start. Have fun with it! Plus, we've added some of our latest games at the bottom for your extra enjoyment.\n\nCHANGELOG\n==========\nVersion 0.1.4 - 0.1.5\n- Improve the section on new games\n\nVersion 0.1.0 - 0.1.3\n- Initial release and feature updates"
