Thanks for your corporation.\n\nThis plugin is used to share any record details to anyone through email. No need for the second user to have SF license.\n\nWant to share data of a record from detail page quickly? Just hit share button and plugin will get all the non null fields data and form a mail ready to be sent.\n\nNOTE - \nLimitations - \n1. This plugin uses mailto: functionality to send email or call out the default app. Please check your default protocol settings or Handler settings under \"chrome://settings/handlers\" for proper opening of mail tab with details.\n2. mailto opens a new url on new tab and there is a limitation around number of characters in url, so right now plugin supports data till 2000 characters which is generally more than sufficient for most records.\n\n\nFuture - \n1. Data share through hosted link\n2. Downloadable file with data\nPlease leave a message on what new features you may want more as future release features.\n\nHelp in Idea - Swapnil Shrikhande"
