The tracker pulls data directly from ACX and plots it.  It runs in the background and the chart can be viewed by clicking the app icon.\n\nThis is intended to help indie authors tell how successful promotions are, watch launch increases, and identify trending.\n\nData Privacy:\nYour sales data stays on your google account.  As developers, we cannot see it, and it will not be shared because we have no access to it.\n\nNOTES:\n1.  The tracker starts on the day that the extension is added- it cannot look into the past, and the first date charted will be the download date.  After that, it will track days.\n2. For a day to be recorded, the user must be logged into ACX.  This tracker does not manage passwords or log ins, and does not support multiple ACX accounts.  The ACX page does not have to be open.\n3.  For a day to be recorded, the user must use Chrome that day between 8AM and midnight."
