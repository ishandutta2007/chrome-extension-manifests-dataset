Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.\n\nWith this extension you are able to customise the number of minutes you want the timer set to through the options page. You're also able to add tasks with the timer."
