Click the name, and you can read an article related to the nickname that documents his track record of hate, bigotry and misogyny.\n\nYou can \"go high\" or opt for a nastier set of names. You can also toggle the plugin on or off. \n\nNote: Though instantaneous in most cases, name replacements may load slower than others depending on site speed, your internet connection, or other factors."
