With this tool which I have been using for a while now made me want to know more about the product by going to it's PH page than ever before. Whenever a new product is posted the extension will automatically find the details and add a small non-intrusive box on the side of the tweet letting you know more about the product.\n\nHere's what the box contains:\nüíØ or ‚¨ÜÔ∏è tells you the total votes the particular product got at the time you're seeing it.\n‚úç shows the total comments.\nand, ‚úîÔ∏è or ‚ùå shows whether the Product has been featured or not."
