Even if I stop working on the app, you would be able to continue using this app with no data loss until either Google stops being a company, or they make a sudden change to Chrome that would break 80% of Chrome Extensions.\n\nContact me at swekage@gmail.com or submit a support request with any bug reports or questions."
