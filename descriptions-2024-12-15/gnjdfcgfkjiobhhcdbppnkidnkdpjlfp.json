This is useful, for example, if you think the thread contains important videos that might be taken down.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1.) Open the target Twitter thread in your browser.\n2.) Click PigVidz, select \"Open Thread Reader App\"\n3.) Wait for the page to finish loading external tweets. Some may always say \"External Tweet loading\" if they were deleted, so ignore those ones.\n4.) Click PigVidz again and choose Archive with either hi res video (best quality) or lo res video (takes up less space on your hard drive).\n5.) Wait for the process to complete. Once all downloads are finished, you will have \"archive.html\" and \"archive_files\" in your Downloads folder. Cut and paste these wherever you like. To test the archive, you can double-click archive.html while your internet is turned off."
