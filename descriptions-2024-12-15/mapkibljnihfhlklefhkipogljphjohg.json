Check out the screenshots, itâ€™s pretty self explanatory!\n\nThis extension will not translate entire webpages to English. Google Chrome already has a built-in feature for that. Instead, this extension makes it easy to translate individual words that you don't understand. This can help you read fully Spanish content online and improve your vocabulary.\n\nI built this extension out of frustration. I'm currently learning Spanish and was spending so much time switching between my current tab and Google Translate. This took a lot of effort, and made Spanish reading an unpleasant chore. \n\nNow you can read song lyrics, stay up-to-date on Latin American news, and finally understand those slang-filled Spanish YouTube comments that seem to appear on every single video...\n\nI want to make this extension as useful as possible. If you have any new feature requests / improvements, or if something is not working for you, please reach out.\n\nYou can do so by clicking on the extension's icon in your browser toolbar, and then following the instructions over there."
