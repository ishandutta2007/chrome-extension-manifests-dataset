We got DMCA'd by Microsoft for the logo, but we got a new one from a very generous Preston Locke. Enjoy!\n\n-----------------------\n\nMy Google account was compromised and an unofficial version (1.1.3) was sent out as an update to all Chrometana users. That update bundled malware.\n\nWe are so incredibly sorry for this and are working with Google to identify how the account was compromised. We have just shipped update 2.0 out now, which includes a streamlined UI and NO MALWARE.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact Theo through Github or feedback on here at any point. Again, we are so sorry about this and are going far out of our way to prevent compromises from happening in the future.\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nRecommended by Engadget, CNET, Gizmodo, IBTimes, WIndowsClub and more!\n\n\"This handy Chrome extension thwarts Microsoft's attempt to make Bing a thing.\" - CNET\n\nBing is an unfortunate thing. Defeat it with Chrometana, allowing for all Bing search requests to redirect to a search engine of your choice. Currently supports Google, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo redirects for all Bing searches, even Cortana ones! Make sure you're using Chrome as your default browser for this to work properly.\n\nCondensed Changelog (Visit the blog for more detail):\nv1.1.2 - Reverted tabs permission request, fallback is now a redirect script\nv1.1.1 - The \"small\" update, decreased package size\nv1.1.0 - UI overhaul\nv1.0.2 - Fix for background app issue\n\nIn order for Chrometana to work when Chrome is closed, you must have background apps enabled. If you have disabled background apps, you can re-enable by doing the following:\n\n1. Go to Chrome Settings\n2. Click \"Show Advanced Settings\"\n3. Scroll down to System\n4. Check \"Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed\""
