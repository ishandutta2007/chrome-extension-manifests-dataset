Additionally, both are quite simple and only deal with paddings, margins, font sizes and colors.\n\nTherefore, there is no data going out to anywhere due to the extension. Incredibly basic functionality.\n\nThe extension's code has also been published on github publicly and you can check it on https://github.com/drArthur/TGSC-Fix-Extension ."
