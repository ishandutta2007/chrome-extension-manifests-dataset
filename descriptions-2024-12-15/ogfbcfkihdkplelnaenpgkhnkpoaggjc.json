This way, when you reload the page, you will be able to immediately spot the new items that you haven't scanned yet, because only those new items links will show a \"not visited\" color. You can also hide the items you marked as read.\n\nThe data about marked as read items is stored on your local browser and is shared between HN pages: If you mark an item as read on the \"news\" page and it later makes it into the home, you will see it as read in the home too.\n\nYou can also choose to follow the comments of a news item: If you do so, the item will appear (with a different color) in the home page even if it was marked as read. You can mark the comments as read, and read the number of unread comments in the home page.\n\nLast but not least, you can collapse comment threads, and show the parent of a comment you're reading by hovering on the \"show parent\" link. This way following discussions with lots of comments becomes easier.\n\nEnjoy!"
