These very inconveniences were experienced first hand by the founding team, and seeing that we were not the only ones struggling with a very archaic and non-consumer friendly parcel delivery system, the idea for Runnr was born.\n\nFounded in 2019, Runnr is a Canadian last mile parcel delivery tech start-up that plans to change the face of the parcel delivery industry. Starting small and proving our business model in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Runnr plans to offer our service Canada wide in the coming years. \n\nHere at Runnr, we pride ourselves in putting the consumer first and really understanding your pain points and your needs above all else. Our unique approach to solving the many troubles you as consumers face while having the items you have ordered online delivered is where we shine. We will be sure to utilize our consumer-first approach and provide you as consumers an unmatched last mile delivery experience.\n\nWe are here to take the stress and inconvenience out of last mile parcel deliveries, and give you peace of mind and a more time efficient way to have your parcels delivered."
