It does so by validating the IP address of online customers. IP addresses can reveal the general location of users. For example, if you use an Internet service provider (ISP) in Los Angeles, California, your IP address will indicate that you are in the Los Angeles area. This information is transmitted to websites as you use the Internet. Most people have no reason to hide their IP addresses. In fact, most are unaware that they even have one.\n\nPhone Number Validation is useful to capture only good leads, keep your user database clean and fight fraud by validating phone numbers at the point of entry into your system. FraudGrade is using the most up-to-date international numbering plans, carrier & line type detection, and location lookup available.\n\nEmail Validation is a procedure that verifies if an email address is deliverable and valid. It runs a process that catches typos, whether they are honest mistakes or purposeful misdirects. It also confirms if a particular email address exists with a reliable domain such as Gmail or Yahoo. This tool not only helps in cleaning your email addresses but also helps in preventing fraud as you can easily determine if a customer is using a disposable email service or free service provider and many more.\n\nDomain Validation is a tool which can detect if an domain is registered or not, if it's a parked domain or blacklisted. It can tell when the domain was created or even when it is supposed to expire. If it's online or possibly who the owner of the domain actually is. Domain Validation is a leading method for detecting fraud in a b2b scenario. \n\nNeed an API key? Get one now at https://www.fraudgrade.com/"
