All the zip content will be listed in the UI. You can download each individual file by clicking on it or download all files to a single folder.\n\nNote 1: this add-on is only designed for \"reading\" a ZIP file. For the inverse operation (zip a folder), you need to use a different application. There is also a reload button at the top left corner in the app UI. Clicking on this button will reload the app. If you want to extract multiple zip files, please do this one by one. It is also recommended to reload the UI after each unzips operation.\n\nNote 2: this add-on is using an open-source JavaScript library for the unzip operation. You can get more info about this library here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js\n\nIf you see any bug or have a feature request in mind, please fill the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/zip-reader.html)."
