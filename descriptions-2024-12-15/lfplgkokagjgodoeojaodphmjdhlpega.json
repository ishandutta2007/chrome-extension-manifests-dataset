You will not have to press the AWS link in the Google apps section every hour.\n- Get temporary STS credentials for CLI access (Replacing tools like aws-google-auth)\n\nAfter installing this extension you need to configure multiple options to get the extension to work properly. Each property has an info tooltip which will explain everything in more detail.\n\nThis project is completely open source, so you can check it for any security concerns you might have.\n\nv1.2.1\n- Updater client now supports both Windows and Linux. Check the GIthub page for more info.\n- You can now select the name of the SAML Provider you set in AWS. It was statically set to 'gsuite' till now.\n- Default values for options are now set each time you start the extension and not only on the first run.\n\nFull changelog available in GitHub."
