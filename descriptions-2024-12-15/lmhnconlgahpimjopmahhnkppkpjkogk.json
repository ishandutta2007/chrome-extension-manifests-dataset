Websites always demand your email address - and it sucks - because you know they'll spam you.\n\nSo we made Inboxes App, a super easy to use browser extension which creates long lasting temporary email addresses for you. You can create new email addresses and delete them from within the extension, saving your real email from unwanted marketing messages ðŸŽ‰\n\nThere's no sign up required, and Inboxes App has already saved our users from receiving over 12.7 million unwanted messages through the use of disposable email accounts.\n\nBy using a long lasting temp mail generator instead of a regular temp email website, you keep access to the address for as long as you want, allowing you to control who you want to be able to contact you.\n\nWhile sites like 10 minute mail, Guerrilla Mail, mailinator and Temp Mail recycle short term emails, Inboxes lets you keep your address indefinitely offering you even more more privacy than a traditional temp mail.",
