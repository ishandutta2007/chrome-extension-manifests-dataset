The extension can be run on any website to provide users with information and insights into the website's safety for financial transactions.\n\nOur inspiration for this project came from the growing concern about online security and the increasing number of cyber threats targeting online shoppers and financial transactions. We recognized a need for a user-friendly tool that could help individuals make informed decisions about the safety of websites when making online payments."
