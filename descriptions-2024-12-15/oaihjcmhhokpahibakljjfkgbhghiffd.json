This button will allow you to watch content on top of other windows.\n\nSecond way: Simply click on the extension icon at the top right of your browser. It will by default select the first available video on your current page.\n\n\n### The Future ###\n\nWe plan on integrating the PIP button for many other sites. For now, sites with the PIP buttons are (but not limited to, if you use the extension icon), YouTube, Netflix and Twitch. The extension and user interface is subject to change, however, not the functionalities.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting ###\n\nMight not work on Chrome 70 versions or lower. Try updating your browser.\n\nIf you still have trouble, please submit your problem here:\nhttps://github.com/jeanmichelmorin/Floating-Video-Player-Youtube-PIP/issues"
