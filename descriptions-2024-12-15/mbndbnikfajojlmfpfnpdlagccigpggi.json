This will let you paste it later on, into your tracker**.\n\nOnce you click submit button, the tool will reset and let you select your next set of options for your following case.\n\nThe data copied to your clipboard will be the same data you chose, with a character that will work as a separator (\"{\", \":\", \"|\"). The idea is to later on we will be able to split the info with those separators. That's why if you type any of these 3 separators characters, you will see a floating message that alerts you that you have typed one of these. Don't worry, you can go back to the text input options and delete them, or replace them.\n\n**NOTE: If you don't paste the data on your tracker right next you hit the submit button, the information might get lost because any of that information isn't stored internally or externally (Like a database)."
