Your input is welcome (and please, do).\n\nTP implements the following types of proxies:\n - \"server\": all other \"proxies\" are directly/indirectly using one or several \"server\" proxies\n - \"PAC\": currently only supports local PAC script code.\n - \"alias\": shortcut to any of the other types of proxies.\n - \"switch\": list of rules to fine-tune the websites to use with or without a proxy\n - \"pool\": if you have a set of unreliable proxies you can group them in \"pools\" and let chrome select the first valid one.\n\nTP allows you to add temporary proxy rules (see popup). This way you can combine multiples proxy profiles.\n\nTiny Proxy doesn't come with predefined proxy servers. But it can very easily import proxies from known websites by copy+pasting a list into its import form.\nPlease, be careful of what you use. Not all servers are secure (far from it).\n\nNotes: \nYou have to select which proxies appear in the popup list. In the settings window, check the box next to their name.\nTP does not support proxy authentication yet. Need volunteers to test...\nTP should be compatible with any unicode letter/symbol. If you encounter a problem, please contact me.\nOnline help is available here (with screenshots and detailed explanations): http://users.skynet.be/alternity/programming/TP/\n\n\n2020-03-03 (0.6.3): bug fixes + export of a subset of proxies\n2019-12-07 (0.6): Strengthened handling of user provided PACscripts, color-coded errors while editing, drag & drop (editing)...\n2019-10-23 (0.5): Bug fixes and new features (import proxy servers by copy/paste list from website)\n2019-07-05 (0.4.3.5): Bug fixed for proxy names using unicode chars. Chrome refuses non-ASCII chars in proxy script. Symbols used in other charsets/languages won't generate a proxy error anymore. Hopefully...\n2019-07-04 (0.4.3.3): bug fixes including failure with servers with per-protocol additional servers\n2019-07-02 (0.4.3): added online help page\n2019-06-25 (0.4.2): added: draggability to proxies list in \"switch\" and \"pool\"."
