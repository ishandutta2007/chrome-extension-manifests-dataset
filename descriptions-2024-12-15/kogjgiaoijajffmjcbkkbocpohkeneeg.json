Want to make sure you're not spending to much time on a ticket? Use this extension to help you. It will highlight the time in your Autotask worklist. It will be green if the stop watch is less than 15 mins, orange for between 15 and 45 mins and red thereafter. If those times don't work for you, you can now customise it! Know when it's time to ask for help!\n\n** New in version 1.5 **\nThe ability to customise the number of minutes the timer goes orange and red. Select the Options of the extension to personalise your times.\n\n** New in version 1.4 **\nTicket Worklist has had an update. Tickets that are \"In Progress\" or \"Customer Note Added\" have that text highlighted in orange. This should help technicians quickly decide which tickets to address next.\n\nPlease note: You need to add the column \"Status\" to your Work list. Click the cog at the bottom of your worklist to launch the Ticket Work List Settings and ensure \"Status\" is in the \"Selected Data\" column. \n\n** New in version 1.3 **\nThe timer inside the Task or Ticket view has also received the highlighted treatment. It follows the same rules as the Worklist timers."
