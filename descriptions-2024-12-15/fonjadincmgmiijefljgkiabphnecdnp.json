The current version of the app supports Basic cards with Front and Back fields only (more features will be added in future versions). \n\n‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èFor the most recent information about the extension, bug reports, committing and more, visit the project's GitHub repository at https://github.com/alexkotusenko/AK_Anki_Extension \n\nTips\n- Click Ctrl+Enter (or Command+Enter on Mac) while focused in one of the fields to submit the card\n- The \"Front\" field cannot be empty, but the \"Back\" one is optional\n- Data entered in both fields will be save, so don't worry about clicking off of the extension window to get more text to paste into your card\n\nImportant Notes\nüî®App Version 1.1.0 (last updated on 20 June 2024)\n‚ö†Ô∏èYou need to get the AnkiConnect add-on for this extension to work, get it here: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159\n‚ö†Ô∏è At the moment, the extension only works with the 23rd version of Anki\n‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you have Anki open locally to be able to use the extension\n‚ùóÔ∏èNote: in the current version, the front and back field data gets wiped every time the extension window gets hidden, so make sure to add all of your front and back info at once (this will be fixed in the future)\n\nSupport\nIf you wish to support the development of this project, feel free to buy me a coffee at https://buymeacoffee.com/alexkotusenko.
