You can then view the list of your bookmarks online from any browser, manage categories and convert bookmarks to tasks, galleries, add notes and more. You can even integrate hooks to trigger your own scripts and perform action on your own server when new links are added. This tool is for taking your bookmarks to another level.\n\nIf you have more than 50 bookmarks in your chrome browser, this tool is for you. If you (like me) have about 2,000 bookmarks for different ideas, resources and concepts, and you keep adding more on daily basis - this tool is a must-have."
