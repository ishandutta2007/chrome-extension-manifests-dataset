It works by taking you to the library's documentation or repository page just clicking on it. \n\nIf you are constantly googling for libraries when browsing repository's code, this extension is for you. I know, you can just type it on the url bar ... but I'm lazy.\n\nIt currently works with javascript, typescript, go and .vim files. If the surfed file does not have a known supported extension, nosey won't add the annotations, so clicking a library will do nothing, but you can manually select the language parser by clicking nosey extension icon next to chrome's url bar."
