It’s a fun, relaxed place where you can find photos of the members from recent events, read Twitter translations, and talk with other K-Pop fans or learn more about the girls in the chatbox.\n\nGDD is regularly updated by its faithful team of uploaders and translators; fans can follow GDD on Twitter (@girlsdaydaily) for the latest posts and news on Girl’s Day. Want to watch a fancam instead of the TV broadcast, or vice versa? Looking for a weekend variety show or perhaps an English subbed version if your Korean isn’t up to snuff? All of these can be streamed from GDD. We are thankful to our fellow fans in Korea who upload variety shows and performances, who share their pictures and videos from events. They are the main resource for all Girl’s Day updates.\n\nGirl’s Day Daily isn’t just about posting the newest headline or video though – it’s also about bringing together fans across the globe. GDD holds birthday events for the Girl’s Day members, anniversary celebrations, and even giveaways during promotions. As always, the staff is friendly and open to suggestions or concerns. If a video is missing or a link is broken, feel free to report it. Together we hope to make GDD a great place for fans."
