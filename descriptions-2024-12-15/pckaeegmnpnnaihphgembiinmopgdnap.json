More often then not we get caught into a loop where the recommended videos or social media feed takes us on a journey with cat-videos, unwanted news and unnecessary information. With this version you can get rid of these distractions and regain your time and focus. Many psychologist have shown that the news feed is the most addicting part of social media, it is much better to read a quote from Gandhi, Anne Frank or Winston Churchill. It also allows the stoic option with quotes of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca or the modern version with quotes of Elon Musk and Carl Newport.\n\nThe quotes and the the inspiration comes from the News Feed Eradicator of Jordan West. With the news feed replacer we want to give an updated esthetic and a version that is updated to chrome version 3. \n\nThe currently supported websites are:\n\n - Facebook\n - LinkedIn\n - YouTube\n - Instagram\n \nJust simply select which newsfeeds of these websites distract you to much, \nand replace it by a quote. Make sure that Youtube, Facebook, LinkedIn or Instagram does not distract you from your work and valuable activities!"
