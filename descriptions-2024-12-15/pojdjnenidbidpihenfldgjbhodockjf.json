There is a visitor pass system that opens the visitor pass as a PDF and then automatically prints it. We needed to be able to close the tab to return the user to a different URL. However, there is no way we could know that ADOBE PDF was finished printing. So we immediately shift the user to the other tab, and then close the \"printing tab\" after a set interval long enough to know that the printing should be complete.\n\nThis is very much required for the Security of the building to function. Please allow this application to be on the market. We need it on the market because some users are too inept to handle the popup that says \"Warning, you have an extension that is in developer mode\". So to not have this popup occur, we'd like to place it on the market, and then use this extension as is."
