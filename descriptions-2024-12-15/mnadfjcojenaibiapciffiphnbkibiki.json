Other channels are: email forward, feature voting portal, public roadmap, feedback widget, NPS widget, Intercom messanger, API, and other.\n\nHow it works:\n- Collect customer feedback\n- Analyze feedback and attach it to features\n- Prioritize features (with RICE framework, or feature count/effort matrix)\n- Send features to Jira or GitLab to get the work done.\n- Once a feature was shipped, close the feedback loop and automatically notify customers.\n\nBuild better products by prioritizing customer needs and placing them at the forefront of every decision."
