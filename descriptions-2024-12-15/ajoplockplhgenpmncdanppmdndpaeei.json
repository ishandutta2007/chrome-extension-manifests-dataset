With Privacy Protector, you can seamlessly replace sensitive data with dummy placeholders, ensuring your interactions remain confidential.\n\nKey Features:\n\nüîè Protect Your Privacy: Anonymize personal information in your text prompts, safeguarding your sensitive data.\nüîÑ Effortless Anonymization: Use a customizable dictionary to replace sensitive information with placeholders, making privacy protection straightforward and intuitive.\nüìÅ Local Data Storage: All data processing occurs locally on your computer. Your dictionary is never shared with any third-parties.\nüìã Streamlined Interaction: Reverse replacements in the chat history and messages received from ChatGPT to facilitate easy copy/pasting the text from ChatGPT, enhancing your productivity.\n‚öôÔ∏è Dedicated Integration: Built specifically for ChatGPT.com, ensuring optimal performance and reliability for all your conversations.\n\n\nHow It Works:\n\n1. Start by adding words you want to replace (e.g., your name, company name, address, etc.) to the dictionary.\n\n2. Anonymize Your Prompt - type your prompt and, before submitting it to ChatGPT, click \"Anonymize Prompt\". This will replace your sensitive data with dummy replacements from the dictionary. This feature is especially useful for long prompts with multiple words to replace. You can choose which prompts need to be anonymized and apply this feature only when necessary by clicking \"Anonymize Prompt\".\n \n3. Reverse Placeholders in Replies - when you receive a reply from ChatGPT, you can revert the placeholders back to the original words by clicking \"Reverse words in Replies\". This feature is handy if you need to copy text from the Chat GPT replies and paste it elsewhere, ensuring you get your original words instead of dummy replacements.\n    \n4. If you wish to see the chat without any replacements, simply click \"Show original page\".\n\nThis extension empowers you to maintain control over your personal information while enjoying the full capabilities of ChatGPT and AI."
