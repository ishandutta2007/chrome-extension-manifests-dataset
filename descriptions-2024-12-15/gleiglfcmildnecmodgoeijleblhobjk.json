Some examples are:\n\n- On Windows, users can change the writing direction to LTR or RTL using CTRL + LEFT or RIGHT SHIFT shortcuts. This feature is missing from Chrome on Linux, but WriteRight enables it.\n- WriteRight also automatically sets the writing direction in webpages that align the text to a fixed side. For example, in Google's website, the search field is fixed to LTR, but WriteRight can change it to RTL if needed.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installing WriteRight, you can use it on any webpage that has input elements. Just start typing and the extension will automatically set the writing direction for you. If you want to override the writing direction, you can use the keyboard shortcuts: left control and left shift for LTR, or right control and right shift for RTL.\n\n## Development\n\nWriteRight was generated using Bing's GPT, a powerful natural language processing model that can create various types of content. The extension's source files are available on [Github](https://github.com/arikw/write-right-extension), where you can also report issues or suggest improvements."
