Do focused speed reading!\n\nDo you use a pen or pencil while reading a textbook? Does it help you read with more focus and speed? Imagine having such a tool for reading online as well!\n\nPacer is that tool. It guides your eyes while reading any text on the web, just like a pencil guides your eyes while reading a textbook. Pacer highlights text in a paragraph sequentially, ensuring your eyes follow the highlighted text, enhancing your reading experience.\n\nPacer works on all popular websites like Wikipedia, The New York Times, Reddit, and ChatGPT. Simply visit the website you want to speed read on, click the Play button in the Pacer toolbox, and start reading.\n\nPacer utilizes a visual technique called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), used by the fastest speed readers in the world. It helps eliminate subvocalization (the inner voice that sounds out each word) and excessive focus on individual words, allowing you to read more visually. This means faster reading while maintaining comprehension. With Pacer, you can boost your reading speed from an average of 200 words per minute to around 400 words per minute or faster. Think of the time you’d save every day!\n\nAs a new tool, Pacer may take a little getting used to. Try adjusting the speed to your liking and selecting the right highlight color. Early reviews suggest that it takes about 3-4 sessions before users become accustomed to Pacer and unlock their full reading potential.\n\nPRO TIP: Reduce subvocalization as much as possible. Focus on the highlighted words and try not to sound them out. You'll notice an instant boost in comprehension!\n\nAs an independent developer, my sole goal is to serve you, the user. I am always working to improve Pacer. Please email me at readwithpacer@gmail.com with any bugs or features you’d find helpful. Your support makes my work possible, and I am tremendously grateful.\n\nFor more information about Pacer and me, visit readwithpacer.weebly.com.\n\nNOTE: Pacer uses analytics code, such as Google Analytics, to measure how many people are using the extension. The analytics code cannot see anything you do on your webpage; it only tracks clicks on the Pacer toolbox and the websites you use it on.\n\nDo try to use the shortcuts highlighted on readwithpacer.weebly.com/how-it-works."
