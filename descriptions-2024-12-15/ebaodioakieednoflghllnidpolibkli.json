Will also show you more information of the destination link, so that you can determine if that is the link that you would like to visit.\nAnother advantage to this extension, you can also check to see if a regular link will redirect you to a completely different link.\nThis extension works with the majority of shortened URLs.\nWe hope you enjoy using this extension."
