The data produced are in JSONL format which can later go through post-processing to be suitable for your DOM optimizations.\n\nThis is an offline extension .a.k.a no data is sent/received to any server, all data produced is stored locally. To show my commitment towards web agents, here is the code for this extension: github.com/omkaark/agenata.\n\nThe current version is basic but the app will soon be highly usable as we account for edge cases. Feedback is more than welcome (open a GitHub issue)!"
