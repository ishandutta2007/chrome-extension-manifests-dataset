So if you are on sellercentral orders page, you can simply scan an orderID barcode and the details view of this order will be opened. If you are on returns page scan a RMA barcode: It to opens the return case for this orderID. If you scan an ASIN it shows it in inventory.  \n\nYou can also use the scanner in Amazon shop to start a search for EAN, UPC, ISBN barcodes.\nAnd you can use it to scan the parcels you ship, for an easy confirmation of shipments incl. tracking numbers.\n\nMore features for packing slips (invoices)\n• your company logo\n• edit a packing slip before printing\n• packing slip without prices \n• print # of pcs bigger if sold > 1 \n• your own greeting text \".... give us a five star rating... \"\n• name of packing agent\n• preset print margins\n\nOther features:\n• link ASINs on order details page to show it in inventory with one click.\n\nYOU NEED:\nTo scan barcodes, you need a hardware barcode scanner. New scanners you can get on ebay starting around 20 € / USD. Your barcode scanner needs to read code128 and work in HID mode (this means it works like an USB or Bluetooth keyboard). It also have to send an ENTER (RETURN) after each scan. All these points are the presets for a lot of scanners. If you scan some barcodes into a text app and every barcode will be shown in a new line, it seems to be fine. Otherwise consult the manual of your scanner. \n\nLatest changes:\n0.0.5.8. fix caused by a html structure change of packing slip page\n0.0.5.7: added support for USPS tracking numbers in \"collect tracking numbers\" and to search an order. \n0.0.5.6: fix for new URLs of order details page \n0.0.5.5: fix for new URLs of packing slip page + added .NL domain\n0.0.5.3: fix for new Confirm Shipment page (to work with the new \"Collect Tracking ID's\" function)\n0.0.5.2: fix for new URLs of packing slip page\n0.0.4.1: added a tool to \"collect tracking id's\" and to confirm the shipping \n0.0.4.0: fix for new order details page\n0.0.3.9: added \"turn\" also to the Test Label settings button\n0.0.3.8: fix for new orderlist, Test lable settings button added on options page\n0.0.3.7: fixed a problem with packslip printing (in case present order is included) \n0.0.3.6: added support for new AZ orderlist, added a label print feature \n0.0.3.3: added India as marketplace\n0.0.3.2: Fixed for new AZ packslip layout \n0.0.3.0: Fixed barcodescan to work in mailbox again\n0.0.2.9: Changed Barcode Generation Libary, for more sharp printed barcodes, Fixed scanning returns to work with the new AZ returns page\n0.0.2.8: When order barcode was scanned, order item details will shown on top of page and pics are bigger, to see the product without need to scroll down.\n0.0.2.7: Fixed seller central domain change in europe to \"sellercentral-europe.amazon.com\"\n0.0.2.5: Fixed scan of RMA barcodes on return page\n0.0.2.4: Fixed new order details view\n0.0.2.0: Added RMA barcode support and scan support in the amazon shop (EAN, UPC, ISBN)\n\n\nThis is beta software, developed mainly for our own use.
