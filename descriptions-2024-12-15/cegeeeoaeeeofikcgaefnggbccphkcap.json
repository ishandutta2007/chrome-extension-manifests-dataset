Well, now it's here.\n\nThe Bitcoin PH extension provides real-time price changes. It notifies you whether the prices go up or down. It is very simple and very user-friendly. This will greatly help you decide when to buy and when to sell your bitcoin. Enjoy!\n\nWhat's new:\n- Removed storage permission.\n\nArchived:\n- Added detailed difference (how much increase/decrease and percentage difference) on the notification\n- Added Options button on notification\n- Added Clear All button on notification\n- Added directing to Options page when the extension icon (badge) is clicked.\n- Added graying out of badge's text when notification is disabled\n\nFor next release, I will add currencies other than PHP, so stay tuned!"
