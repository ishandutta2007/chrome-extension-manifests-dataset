Since v1.9.0, the extension removes the functionality where a popup asks an unauthenticated user to sign up when visiting one of the three timeline tabs:   \n\n* Tweets, Tweets & Replies, Media.\n\nThis enables unauthenticated users to view the tweets and media tabs by clicking on them, the replies tab no longer shows a pop up but still needs an account.\n\nSince v1.11.0, the extension rewrites the profile url on a users profile page  (`https://twitter.com/user`), to be a direct link to its destination instead of going through https://t.co to get there.\n\nNeutral is open source, you're welcome to check it out:\nhttps://github.com/r-obert/neutral.js"
