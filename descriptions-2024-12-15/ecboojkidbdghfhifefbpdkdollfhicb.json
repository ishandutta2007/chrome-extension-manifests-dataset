For example, when you know you want to search on another site like Wikipedia or Amazon, our bangs get you there fastest. A search for '!w filter bubble' will take you directly to Wikipedia.\"\n\n\n➡️ How does the extension work\n\nSimply install the extension and use any of the supported Kagi Bangs (see https://kbe.smaertness.net/). Bangs can be used at the beginning or at the end of the query, e.g.:\n\n• !gm here to closest restaurant\n• here to closest restaurant !gm\n\nBangs can also be triggered without any query, serving as a bookmark shortcut:\n\n• !bbc\n\n➡️ Features\n\n• Kagi Bangs: More than 13,500 default bangs included.\n• Custom Bangs: You can create your own bangs or override defaults.\n• Custom Bang Symbol: Define your own custom symbol(s) to trigger the bangs.\n• Mobile Support: Yang! is also available on Firefox Android.\n• Fast Redirections: Bangs are resolved locally, without Kagi as intermediary.\n• Address Bar Trigger: You can use bangs directly in the URL bar.\n• Search Engine Trigger: Bangs also work from the search bar of your favorite search engine.\n• Backup and Restore: Never lose your bangs.\n\n\n➡️ FAQs\n\n• Do bangs sync across devices?\nYes... and no. Bangs will sync across all the Firefox desktop browsers in which you are logged in with your Firefox account. However, the sync between desktop and mobile is currently unsupported. As a workaround, you can create a backup on desktop and restore it on Android (or vice versa).\n\n• Why does Yang! need permissions on a 300+ sites?\nInstead of requesting data access on all sites, we granularly specify the search-engine sites that Yang! supports (which yeah, they're quite a few). You can find which sites we request permissions for in the manifest.json."
