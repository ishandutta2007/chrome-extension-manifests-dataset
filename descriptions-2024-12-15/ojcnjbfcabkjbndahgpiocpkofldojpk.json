This tool can display the number of games in your weekly matchups, calculate expected player stats, and show shortcuts to your favorite tools for more in-depth analysis like DobberHockey and DailyFaceOff.\n\n* What platform does this work on?\nThis tool only works on Yahoo! Fantasy Hockey at the moment.\n\n* How are expected stats calculated?\nWe take the player's per game stats for each category and multiply by the number of games in the matchup. By default, it takes the current season stats to calculate but you may use the previous season instead."
