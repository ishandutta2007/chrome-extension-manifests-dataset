Inspired by the concept of TAZ (Temporary Autonomous Zones), this tool disrupts the endless flow of online browsing by introducing a serene, visual environment when 16 or more tabs are open. As users navigate with their usual browsing habits, the extension activates a time-out-of-time zone, when needed that overlays the active content with dynamic, moving grid-based visuals, inspired by the natural progression of light and color on the sky throughout the day. This unique visual experience encourages users to pause, reset, and momentarily disconnect from the constant demands of the attention economy. Whether for productivity breaks or mindfulness moments, \"disruptive.harmony.online\" offers a fresh approach to managing digital overwhelm, fostering a healthier relationship between technology and personal well-being.\n\n\nInstructions\nTo use the extension, first you should add it to chrome, then click the icon from the extension area to open the popup interface and then simply click [enter] to enable it and start monitoring the number of tabs. When 16 or more tabs are detected, the visual experience begins, offering you a moment of serenity. When you close the extra tabs and you have 15 or less open the overlay visuals will be removed. If you want to stop the extension, click [leave] from the popupâ€™s interface to exit and return to the web's usual chaotic flow of activity. While the visual compositions are active you can reset or save a moment through the interface on the bottom of the screen.\n\n\nAn art project by Athanasios Katsougiannis\nhttps://athanasioskatsougiannis.gr/\n\nFor personal use only:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"
