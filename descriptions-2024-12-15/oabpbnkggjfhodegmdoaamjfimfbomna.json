We recommend using depth 9 or above. Note: Using depth too high risks your account getting closed.\n-\tMax wait time: Only applies to “Automove” mode. This allows you to set how long it takes for the extension to make the next move.\n-\tWinning chance: Get realtime evaluation of the match. Note: this is based on the assumption that the opponent makes perfect moves, so it's fine even if the evaluation fluctuates.\n-\tAutomove: The extension automatically plays for you.\n-\tVoice suggestion: The extension will tell you which move to play using voice suggestion (Recommended on Lichess).\n-\tAuto play new game: The extension will automatically find a new game once the current one finishes.\n-\tBongcloud: Joke opening.\n\nNotes:\n1.\tThe extension doesn’t highlight the positions when playing on lichess.org, is this an error?\nNo, this is intentional. lichess.org can detect cheating if the extension draws on the screen, so we disabled this feature entirely. However, you can use the extension by turning on either the autoplay mode or voice suggestion mode.\n2.\tIf you have any suggestions or found any issues, please email us at speedrunlegend123@gmail.com."
