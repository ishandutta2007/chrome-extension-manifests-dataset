It should work with any page that uses the W3C Clipboard API.\n\nChrome restricts clipboard access to very specific cases, each of which requires user interaction, and does not provide a mechanism for manually granting access such that user interaction is not required going forward.\n\nThis extension is intended to provide such a mechanism, and it is our hope that mainstream browsers will provide such a mechanism on their own in the future, rendering this extension unnecessary.\n\nThis extension is open source and licensed under the MIT license. Its source code can be found on GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/glyptodon/clipboard-permission-manager"
