If you're looking for something to brighten up your walls, to make a statement, or just to be unique, then these quality, easy to apply and remove vinyl wall stickers are the perfect way for you to do this.  For anyone that hasn't come across wall stickers before... In simple terms we start by cutting your chosen vinyl design on a silicon coated backing paper, we then apply a low tack application tape on top which when removed from the backing paper holds the design in the intended format.\n\nOnce the wall stickers have been applied to the surface and the application tape removed, you are left with your unique vinyl wall decal. YouTube video \n \n  \n As we use a thin 70 micron matt opaque vinyl it gives the impression of a beautiful, sleek, smooth painted design.\n\nWe strive to give you the highest quality wall art stickers using stunning, beautiful and unique designs that cater for all tastes.  We have a number of designs to choose from for any room throughout your home.  Lots of different colour choices, some with bespoke personalised names to input, and an option to change the orientation of various designs.  Each delivered vinyl also comes with a FREE application spreader and fitting instructions to follow, making application easy for all.\n\nWe only use quality wall art specific vinyl, which as it has a semi-permanent adhesive will remove much easier than standard vinyls, if the painted surface is sound the vinyl will leave no damage or residue when removed. This means it is ideal for people who rent or just don't wish to re-decorate once the sticker is removed !\n\nA great benefit to using wall art stickers ahead of conventional wallpaper or painting techniques is their ease of use and accessibility for all.  As you can see from our help page they really are easy to apply and the low cost compared to other wall decor products means that they don't make a large dent in your pocket, which is a massive bonus !  They are a far more fun and creative use of your wall space and each design makes it's own statement."
