It allows you to convert one crypto to another as well as see a price in BTC and USD. The best feature is the highlight to convert, where when the extension is open, whatever you highlight will automatically get copied over to the conversion field, and the conversion run in real time. Extremely useful. \n\nFeatures\n-Highlight the number you want converted on the page and it automatically does it for you\n-Save multiple conversions so you can easily switch between cryptos\n-Has multiple exchanges to check and compare prices easily\n-SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE DESIGN AND FORMAT!!!!\n\nI day trade crypto and I realized there was nothing out there for what I needed. I just wanted it so that whatever number I highlighted on the screen, I could see it in US dollars, or a different crypto. I also wanted to easily compare prices from one exchange to another. Although there are apps out there that do this, I just wanted a simple chrome extension so that I could directly trade on the exchanges sites, and not through a 3rd party app.\n\nYou're going to love using it while trading. I also want feedback so that I can add new features in the coming versions.\n\nThanks,\nGeorge"
