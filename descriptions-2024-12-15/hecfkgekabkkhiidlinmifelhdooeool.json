Rather than showing you a massive inbox of new posts to sort through, you see a list of recently active individuals. The page updates as new posts are discovered.\n\nFraidycat also focuses on \"importance\" - each account or website that you follow can be assigned a priority, whether you want to keep up in \"Real-time\" or if you \"Rarely\" want updates. In this way, you can track important \"Real-time\" follows on the front page, while lower priority items are hidden away.\n\nOther features are:\n- Sync. If you are logged in to Chrome, your follows will be synced between any Chrome browsers running the extension.\n- Import and export of your saved data to JSON, OPML and HTML files.\n- Tags. Follows can be categorized into separate tabs. Even emoji can be used as tags!\n- Concise. Rather than filling up your display with large posts, each follow is given two lines of summary. (See our screenshots.)\n- Live and pinned posts. If an account is currently 'live' or has 'pinned' posts, these are shown in that follow's status line.\n- Dark mode. You can alternate between light and dark themes.\n- Fraidycat supports most social networks and feed types.\n\nFraidycat is a whole new concept in tracking creators on the Web. If you don't quite see how this is different from a classic feed reader, check out our video above to see the tool in action.\n\n\"I did not expect how immediately and wholeheartedly I would appreciate and enjoy [Fraidycat] once I began to use it.\" - Jason McIntosh\n\n\"I am enjoying the browser extension called Fraidycat, which presents a lovely, anarchic opportunity: follow all the people you like, no matter what platform they’re using, without having accounts on those platforms. Basically, it’s an 'RSS… or whatever' reader.\" - Robin Sloan\n\n\"It’s really neat, and I’m already finding it a much more deliberate and less distracting way of surfing the modern web that doesn’t just involve me mindlessly refreshing social feeds and closing and opening various browser tabs like a rat in a maze.\" -  Nick Statt, The Verge"
