Web surfing is contributing actively to the carbon footprint of mankind. That‚Äôs where the idea of sustainable surfing behavior and responsible use of data come in. If you take into account all the things that data can tell you about your environment, then using these resources in a way that reduces your carbon footprint is an excellent first step.\n\nWe help you to make surfing decisions by rating websites after following criteria:\n\nPage Optimization:\nThe more optimized a websites code is, the more efficiently the website runs and the faster it loads. This not only increases user satisfaction, but also reduces energy consumption, which in turn ends up in a smaller carbon footprint.\n\nPage Size:\nA bigger page size means more data being send. More data being send means more traffic. More traffic means more energy spent. More energy spent means more carbon emitted.\nAs an example, lowering the page size by one megabyte would save about 0.4g of CO‚ÇÇ every time a website is clicked.\n\nGreen Web Hosting:\nIn order for a data center to be considered ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, it has to match several criteria.\nCriteria include, but are not limited to:\nbeing powered by renewable energy, offsetting the carbon footprint, use of energy saving appliances, planting plants around premises, and more.\n\n\nEnergy efficiency has become an important part of how internet programmers think about building the web. Data taken out of existing databases is used to produce more efficient structures and ensure a cleaner surfing experience for the user. In order to ensure the energy efficiency of our own extension, we also draw our data from established datasets, instead of wasting additional energy by scraping them again ourselves.\n\nWe rely on this datasets:\n\nDataset A: httparchive.org\nDataset B: thegreenwebfoundation.org\n\nOur code is available on GitHub:\nExtension: https://github.com/chronikum/EcoSurfExtension\nServer: https://github.com/chronikum/EcoSurfServer\n\nWe do not track users or save any data on our servers. Please look into our GitHub code if you want to know more.\nPrivacy Policy: https://ecosurf.io/2021/07/13/extension-privacy-policy/"
