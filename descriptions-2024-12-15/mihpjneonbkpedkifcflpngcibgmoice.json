This tool is particularly useful for monitoring the live status of services, especially when servers support live status requests.\n\nHow It Works\nThe extension operates by sending out a fetch request to each website on your list every 30 seconds.\nIt then searches for a specific text within the response, such as \"Server Enabled\", to determine if the site is operational.\nUsers can add an unlimited number of websites to their monitoring list.\nUsers can add an action URL, which will be opened by pressing on the action button.\nStatus Indication\nGreen Icon: All monitored websites are available and responding positively to the fetch requests.\nYellow Icon: Some of the monitored websites are not available or not responding as expected.\nRed Icon: None of the monitored websites are available, indicating all are down or unresponsive.\nExample Usage\nImagine you want to monitor a service that supports live status requests. You can use this extension to continuously check if the response from the server contains the phrase \"Server Enabled\". If it does, the service is considered up and running.\n\nBenefits\nReal-time Monitoring: Keep an eye on the availability of your favorite or critical websites in real time.\nQuick Glance Status: Easily understand the status of all monitored websites with a simple color-coded system.\nCustomizable: Add as many websites as you need to monitor, tailoring the extension to your specific requirements.\nThis Chrome extension is an essential tool for webmasters, IT professionals, and anyone who needs to ensure that their services are always up and running."
