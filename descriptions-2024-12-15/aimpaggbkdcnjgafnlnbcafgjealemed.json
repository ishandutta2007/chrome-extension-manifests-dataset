Customize how soon the reminder pops up - it's ok to take a mental breather after all! Turn the extension on and off, manage your list of distracting sites, and choose how long you want to relax. A simple and functional extension to give you your time back.\n\nPrivacy policy : This extension does not send or sell your browsing information. It does store the list of sites that you generate to your Google account."
