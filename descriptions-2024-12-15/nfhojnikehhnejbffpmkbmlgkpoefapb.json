It allows a user to track which jobs they've applied to on the website. This is done by changing the background of the job listing to whatever color the user wants the default is green. The extension also allows you to create a list of banned keywords that you do not want to see. For example you can create a list that include \"Manager\", \"Senior\",  and \"Sr\". Now next time you load a page the jobs containing those words will have a colored background of the users choice and the default is red. The user also has the option to just hide those jobs from ever appearing by changing the settings in the extension popup window."
