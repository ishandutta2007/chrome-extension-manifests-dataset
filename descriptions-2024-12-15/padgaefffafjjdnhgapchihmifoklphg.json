The information they provide is not crowdsourced and open like MDN, often lacking proper documentation, examples and sources.\n2. Their webpages contain various third party cookies and trackers\n3. They serve targeted advertisements which could be inconvenient for their users\n\nWith all those problems, it is annoying to see them as top results on DuckDuckGo.\n\nWhile helping websites like MDN to improve their SEO for better placement on search results is an option in the long run, this small tool helps to get rid of the annoyance.\n\nThis extension is inspired by \"Hide w3schools\" Firefox add-on by Stefano Nardo which works only for Google search results.\n\nThis add-on is open source, and the source is available at https://git.sr.ht/~eih/hide-w3schools-ddg for you to inspect and improve."
