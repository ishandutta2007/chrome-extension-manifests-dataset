It has an enjoyable interface and always keeps your safety in mind.\n\nElpass isolates your vault strictly. Your data is stored on your device locally and synced with a third-party cloud service like iCloud and Dropbox. Your data will be encrypted with bank-level algorithms before being sent, making sure that nobody can access it without your master password.\n\nSecurity is critical, but sometimes we don't want so many troubles for insignificant items. You may set a security level for every item. A convenient level item may fill automatically without any interaction. However, a high level item requires biometric verification every time.\n\nAbout convenience,  Elpass can auto-fill logins for webpages and native applications on macOS. You never need to open the password manager and copy passwords manually.\n\nThis version works with Windows and Linux."
