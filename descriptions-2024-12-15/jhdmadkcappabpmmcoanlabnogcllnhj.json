There is no reliable way to filter products by country of origin to support local manufacturers and businesses in the United States. Whether the goal is to support local businesses and jobs, ensure the quality of our products, or to uphold ethical labor standards, we all have reasons for wanting to support our industries during these difficult times. \n\nWhen you perform a search on Amazon, we analyze and label products as \"Made In America\" after analyzing their product descriptions and feature details.\n\nThis extension only analyzes products on Amazon.com currently. We are working hard to expand to more websites shortly."
