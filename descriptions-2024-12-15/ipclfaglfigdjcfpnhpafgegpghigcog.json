You can then ask your existing mutual connection for an introduction. These introductions can lead to conversations that help you position yourself in your application and maybe even a referral.\n\nAfter you navigate to someone's LinkedIn connections list ('500+ connections' under their profile picture), launch the extension. It will open profile after profile and search each profile's current company's jobs page for the job title(s) you set. The extension will store any relevant job openings it finds and makes them easily accessible. You can then ask the person whose connections list you scanned for an introduction.\n\nTo tailor the selection of people to scan, you can filter a connection list by industry, location, etc., using LinkedIn's native filter options.\n\nTo get started:\n1. Install the extension (and pin it to your favorites by clicking the 'pin' symbol in the puzzle piece extension menu).\n2. Navigate to someone's LinkedIn connections list (click '500 connections' under someone's profile picture).\n3. Open the extension, set your desired job title, and limit how many profiles to scan per day (recommended to start: 300).\n4. Click 'Load' and let the extension do its thing. It's recommended to keep Chrome front and center while the extension is searching. If you have another browser (e.g. Firefox or Safari), use that for your other browsing.\n5. When you're done, stop the extension on the connections tab, and review the found job listings.\n\nFeatures:\n- Set one or more job titles to search for.\n- Launch it in someone's connections list.\n- Limit the number of profiles to visit per day.\n- Automatically skip profiles that were scanned in the past 7 days and companies that were scanned in the past 12 hours.\n- Download all jobs as a CSV.\n\n*Currently, this extension only searches for jobs on companies' abbreviated job pages. These pages display up to ~3 openings that most align with your job preference as indicated in your LinkedIn profile and should be sufficient for most people. Because of how LinkedIn structures its web pages, the job title of the person who works at the company with the opening may not be accurate.\n\nThe extension doesn't send anything to outside servers, everything stays on your device.
