The most interesting feature of this title is that you will be able to participate in frantic games of up to 50 players. Only one can survive.\n\nFight your way to fight and survive\nAt first glance, the graphic design of this title will capture your attention, as it is very similar to Fortnite. From here, the experience is similar to other similar games in the genre.\n\nThe game starts with all players aboard a plane from which they can jump at any time. Upon reaching the ground, they must rush to collect weapons, ammunition, bulletproof vests, helmets, first aid kits, and other pieces of equipment, even vehicles to move around the map.\n\nOnce well-equipped, players have to go in search of all other players and eliminate them. And keeping in mind that the safe zone is getting smaller and smaller, so the survivors will be forced to confront each other.\n\nTo play, you have a map and buttons for jumping, running, and several shooting options (standing, lying down, crouching). The control panel changes when you get into one of the vehicles and you can drive different types of vehicles.\n\nTo top it all off, it is made up of several characters with different skins, a wide variety of weapons (including some special ones, such as frying pans or katanas), and a 4v4 game mode. All in all, downloading the APK file offers a fun mobile shooter game for free with excellent gameplay. It may not be the most original proposal, but it is so well-optimized that it even runs smoothly on the most humble devices.\n\nWho is the developer of Sigma BR\n\nLittle is known about the development team behind Sigma, only that it calls itself Studio Arm Private Limited, and here it is supposed to be based in Singapore. They have no other known games or apps and their developer listing on Google Play is no longer available since the removal of the game from the official Google store. However, when you open the game on your Android, the name and logo of Daemon appear, which has a profile on different social networks such as Facebook or TikTok where they talk about the launch of the game, without ensuring that it is an official account.\n\nWhy Sigma is not on Google Play\n\nInitially, this game was available on the Play Store, but it only lasted about 48 hours before it was removed, during which time it reached 500,000 installs. The main reason for its removal was that Google believed it violated the store's developer policies due to its many similarities with another great game of the battle royale genre: Garena Free Fire. It is not known if Garena had anything to do with this withdrawal through any petition or complaint.\n\nIs Sigma Battle Royale still working?\n\nDespite the removal of Google Play, Sigma can be downloaded from other sources such as the one you are in, and until very recently, it could continue to be played normally. However since a few hours ago, if you download and install the Sigma APK, you will find a message that the server is closed for maintenance, thanking the users for having participated in the beta test phase of the game and informing that it will be back soon. We do not know when this will be as the official release date of the stable version of Sigma has not yet been announced.\n\nSigma vs Free Fire: comparison and differences\n\nWhat is undeniable is that one of the pillars of the great success of Sigma is its resemblance to another very popular battle royale such as Garena Free Fire, to such an extent that many users have not hesitated to baptize it as Free Fire Lite. The game is practically identical, hence its removal from Google Play as mentioned above. Even so, we can \n\nhighlight some differences:\n\nIt is a game more suitable for low-end smartphone devices, with a smaller installation package, and also consumes fewer resources.\nThe graphics are somewhat more cartoon-like compared to the graphics of Garena Free Fire.\n\nObviously, not being on Google Play, Sigma can only be downloaded and installed via an APK file.\n\nRequirements and additional information:\n\nMinimum operating system requirements: Android 4.1.\n\nThis program is a modified version of the original application, developed by a third party that has nothing to do with the owner or with Malavida, who have not verified, validates or approved the latter. Downloading, installing and using this program is under the userâ€™s exclusive responsibility, without Malavida being liable for the effects or results that may take place on your device. Neither Malavida, nor the original developer of the modified app, nor any of their trademarks have any sort of relationship with this version."
