It's what's coming up ahead that we care to see and this calendar delivers it beautifully!\n\nThis extension shows the previous year and upcoming year by the week in one long continuous block, starting 12 months in the past and going for 12 months into the future. The past on a calendar is not that useful so this calendar opens up on the present but you can scroll back up to see the previous 12 months as needed."
