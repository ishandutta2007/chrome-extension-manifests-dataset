You will no longer need to manually sync your videos. This is especially helpful if some people in your group have slow internet or need frequent pauses. It inspired by SyncTube, but designed to work not only on YouTube but on every website that has a video in it.\n\n*** How it works?\nYou choose one person as a room host(his/her name would be green). The host then plays some video. Plugin detects it and starts to broadcast the state of the video to everyone in the room. If another person in the room has the same video opened, it will start to follow the host's state. \n\n*** User guide\nPerson 1\n    1. Install the plugin\n    2. Create room\n    3. Start video in the browser\n    4. Wait for another person to join your room\n    5. Enjoy synchronized watch experience\n\nPerson 2\n\n    1. Install the plugin\n    2. Join the room\n    3. Navigate to the page containing the video\n    4. Enjoy synchronized watch experience\n\n*** Privacy notice\n\nWe promise not to store any of your data. If you don't trust us you can build and host your own server from sources.\n\n***\nhttps://github.com/Deedone/Synctastic - Source code\nhttps://forms.gle/2LRe3wdofcz59b8q8 - Report bugs"
