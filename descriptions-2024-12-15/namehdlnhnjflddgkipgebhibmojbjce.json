All detection happens locally in your browser - so the extension works even if you are offline and you open saved webpages. We respect your privacy - no web browsing data is collected.\n\nHow to use Nude2ban?\n1. Install the extension\n2. (optional) As by default extensions are turned off in incognito mode, you can open your extensions (chrome://extensions/), select Nude2ban and in \"Details\" turn on \"Allow in incognito\"\n\nFor some websites with many pictures/photos (e.g. photo banks) inference takes some time. You can turn off the filter in the extension popup during the session with such a website if you are sure that there is no offensive content. The filter is applied on the page reload.\n\nAlso you can have a list of safe websites which Nude2ban  doesn't apply filtering to. Just open the extension when browsing such a website and add it to the list by toggling the switch."
