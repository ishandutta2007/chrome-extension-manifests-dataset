This set of URLs can then be launched by going to that particular location in game.\n\nYou might associate a URL for your emails with the letter box of your game world house, your main works tasks with one of the buildings in town, websites you use to relax in the park. Websites you don't want to visit too often can be placed far away.\n\nThis allows you to keep your \"workspaces\" separate and organised, and allows you to easily switch between them without having to hoard tabs. It also adds an element of simulated cost/distance for switching between tasks to help encourage single tasking.\n\nThe ideal way to use this application is to have it as your \"home base\". You should always keep the application open, and use the game world to navigate around the web.\n\nThis Chrome extension is required for the URLtown.io application to work. This allows the application to launch your saved tabs, and close them when a session is ended. It also stores your saved tabs in storage so that you can access them again when returning to the application."
