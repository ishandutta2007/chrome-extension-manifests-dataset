However, there are usually too many requests to review for every developer, resulting in bad or no reviews. We try to help by prioritizing pull requests for a developer, so they can at least review the important PRs carefully. We help prioritize by adding context to the PR, like the familiarity of the reviewer with the files changed in the PR (using git commit history). Additional context can be added by integrating production events and business events (coming soon).\n\nWe currently support GitHub and Bitbucket. To request support for other Git hosting services, like GitLab, Gitae, Azure repos etc., please drop us an email at contact@vibinex.com."
