No data about the user is collected or sent anywhere.\n-  The username & password information, if entered by the user, is encrypted and stored locally.\n-  Data stored (only if the user voluntarily allows and enters it): school subdomain (i.e. \"lynbrook\", \"montavista\", etc), username, password, overall grade percentages for each class (used for notifications), and theme selection/customization options\n\nSource code & more details available at https://github.com/maheshmurag/InTheLoop\n\nFeatures:\n - Add, delete, and edit grades\n - Chrome desktop notifications when grades change\n - Functions with both weight-based and points-based gradebooks\n - Add and edit categories\n - Calculate grade after the final exam\n - View total number of points per category (by hovering over category percentages)\n - Change the appearance of your School Loop page using pre-loaded or custom themes\n\nCreated by Mahesh Murag and Akhil Palla\n\nNotes: \n\n- In The Loop might have trouble with extra credit assignments or grades in categories that don't exist. Please report any issues you see by emailing maheshmmurag@gmail.com or posting at https://github.com/maheshmurag/InTheLoop/issues\n\n- Rather than attempting to process an unusual format and potentially calculate incorrect results, the extension automatically disables grade calculation tools if it is unable to process a teacher's gradebook (usually because of an unusual grade entry format). \n\n- This extension is in beta, and lacks some features (such as processing custom letter grades like \"A\"/\"B\"/\"C\" etc). \n\n- The icon, \"schoolloop.com\", and any other School Loop assets used in this extension belong to School Loop, Inc. Any other assets belong to their respective owners."
