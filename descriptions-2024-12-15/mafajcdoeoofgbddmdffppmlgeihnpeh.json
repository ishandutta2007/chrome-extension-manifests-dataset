That video’s corresponding copyright content will open in a picture in picture style separated window. Both videos will then play synchronously with one another. Maintaining synchronicity when you, the user, interact with either video in any way. Feel free to pause, play, or seek all you want.\n\nDownload the extension and watch our demo video for more information.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnNlN0nqZhk\n\nAre you a YouTuber that wants to do a full video commentary track over any movie that’s streaming on Netflix?\n\nOr maybe you want to create a reaction video or review on another copyright protected YouTube video?\n\nNO PROBLEM!\n\nContact VODL and become a VODL creator. We can link your content with your desired Netflix movie or YouTube video with no fear of copyright claims, strikes, or demonetization.\n\nVODL DOES NOT BLOCK ADS.\n\nIf you’re a creator on YouTube, not only will you retain all ad revenue. If the content your video is referencing also has ads, the owner of that content will retain all ad revenue as well. Ads will not break synchronicity and will play in full.\n\nNO COPYRIGHT INFRINGMENT ON PAID STREAMINGT SERVICES.\n\nViewers of copyright content streamed from paid streaming services MUST HAVE ACCESS TO A VALID ACCOUNT. For example, if a VODL YouTube video links to a movie streaming on Netflix; the viewer must have a valid Netflix account to view the Netflix movie.\n\nWith VODL, streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, Disney +, and more; can leverage the full influential weight of any social media creator. Funneling internet traffic, interest, and ad revenue, directly toward their own content.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe VODL extension sets a series of trigger points along the timeline of VODL YouTube videos. These trigger points define what and when copyright content is displayed to the viewer. When the VODL YouTube video reaches its first trigger point, copyright content opens and plays in a synchronized window. Other trigger points can be added to define automatic, play events, pause events, seek events, and more.\n\nOur goal is to license our patent pending software to YouTube or any other streaming company that’s struggling with copyright infringement.\n\nContact us if you’re thinking about including VODL natively in your streaming service."
