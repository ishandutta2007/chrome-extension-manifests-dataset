You can configure it to have steps in the pipeline where the user has to click a button to continue the build. Since these buttons have a timeout, the build process will cancel if you don't react on time. This is a pretty annoying mistake to make, so you really don't want to miss the button click. This extension beeps at you whenever you need to click the button!\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n1. Make sure you keep your Jenkins tab in the foreground\n2. Sounds are only allowed if you've interacted with (clicked on) a tab before\n3. You can enable or disable the extension by clicking on the icon"
