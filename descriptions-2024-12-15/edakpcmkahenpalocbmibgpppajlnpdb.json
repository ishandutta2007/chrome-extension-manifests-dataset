Residential exposure to radon gas, for example, has similar cancer risks as passive smoking. Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents\"\n\nSimplified text: \"Radiation can cause mutations, but it is not very strong at doing so. For example, being exposed to radon gas at home can give you a similar risk of getting cancer as being around someone else who is smoking. Radiation is more likely to cause cancer if someone is also exposed to other things that can cause cancer.\"\n\nðŸ¤– Technical-\nOriginal text: \"GPT models are artificial neural networks that are based on the transformer architecture, pre-trained on large datasets of unlabeled text, and able to generate novel human-like text.\"\n\nSimplified text: \"GPT models are like computer brains that learn how to write by reading lots of text. They use a special structure, called a transformer, and don't need to be told what to write. They can come up with new sentences that sound like they were written by a person.\"\n\nðŸ“˜ Math-\nOriginal text: \"In mathematics, the derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\"\n\nSimplified text: \"The derivative in math measures how much a function's output value changes when the input value changes. It's a basic part of calculus. Here's an example: If you know the position of a moving object at different times, you can find its velocity by taking the derivative of its position function with respect to time. This tells you how fast the position is changing over time.\""
