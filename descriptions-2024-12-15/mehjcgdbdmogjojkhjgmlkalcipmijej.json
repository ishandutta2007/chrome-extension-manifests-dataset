So I have written a small Chrome plugin that attempts to fix this issue.\n\nThis is the third major version of this plugin, unfortunately rather than making it better the major versions have just been to keep up with google's new products, first Picasa, then G+, now Photos.\n\nThis is v1 for Photos, and it is pretty rough, especially since I wrote it in one night.  But it seems to function, could use some CSS help though.\n\nUse the naming structure Folder/Folder/Folder/Album when creating your album names.\n\nChangeLog:\n\nv0.403 - Change album names to display only the name of the level navigated to rather than the entire name.\nv0.402 - add settings to control error retries, scroll attempts, scroll wait time during initial load.\nv0.401 - Port to Google Photos"
