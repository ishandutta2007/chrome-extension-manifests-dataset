It's fetched every 60 seconds or when the user clicks on the icon.\n\nAbout badge background colours:\n* black - price did not change from last fetch.\n* green - price went up\n* red - price went down\n\nSo... green is good, red is bad ;)\n\nDepending on the rate it might not fit very well. Just right click the icon, select \"Options\" and from there select your desired price precision.\n\nAlso added possibility to configure notifications so user gets notified when price rises over or falls below configured threshold. Once the limit is met, user is notified and the limit is set to that value - and this is repeated every time new limit is crossed. Go disable the notifications or set a new limit if you get annoyed.\n\nsource code: https://github.com/tanelpuhu/bitstamp-btc-price\n\nps. made it for personal use, things might and will break, Bitstamp might be down (eg. maintenance)\n\n\n\n*** This is not an official plugin! ***\n\nThe author of this plugin has no affiliation with Bitstamp., nor is this plugin endorsed or supported in any shape or form by the Bitstamp.\n\nMore info about Bitstamp can be found from bitstamp.net"
