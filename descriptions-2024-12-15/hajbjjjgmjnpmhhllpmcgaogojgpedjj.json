This extension allows you to drag and resize the sidebar to enlarge the previews. You can adjust the previews of the current/previous/next slides so that they are large enough that you don't have to keep turning around to see the projected screen; you can keep your eyes towards the audience.\n\nContribute on Github: https://github.com/jpotterm/chrome-resizable-speaker-notes"
