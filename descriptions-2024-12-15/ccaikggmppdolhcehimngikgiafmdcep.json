With efTwo, you type in either 'replace' or 'replacing' and it will search all inflections for you. A truly essential and unique feature of efTwo.\n\nTo find just a specific word from your search term, just click that word and the search box will change: if you click the next button or hit a hotkey (eg F2), it will jump only to that word on the page.\n\nPlease, leave a comment, bug report or feature request in the comment box below.\n\nI'm planning to add features to the plugin soon, but until then, I'd be more than happy to see some feedback from You!\n\n============\n\nWhat Others Say About Us\n\nLifehacker Australia\nhttp://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/07/eftwo-supercharges-find-on-browser-pages/\n\nLifehacker US\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5831195/eftwo-supercharges-chromes-find-on-page-by-finding-multiple-words-at-once-word-variations\n\nLifehacker Japan\nhttp://www.lifehacker.jp/2011/08/110818eftwo.html\n\nAddictivetips\nhttp://www.addictivetips.com/internet-tips/eftwo-f2-finds-multiple-words-their-inflections-on-a-page-chrome/\n\nMakeuseof\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/dir/eftwo-word-inflections/\n\n============\n\nWhat's new\n\n1.4\nFixing the bug with losing the settings over time (finally)\nMaking the extension compatible with new Chrome versions\n\n1.3.1\nMore robust Google keyword detection\n\n1.3.0\nFix for Google Search keywords, bugfixes\n\n1.2.1\nBugfixes\n\n1.2.0\nQuoted search term support (partial)\nBugfixes\n\n1.1.5\nAdded support for more search engines (currently Google, Bing, Yahoo is tested, more might be supported)\nAdded hover delete for easy word removal\nFixed settings page design\nSupport for shortcut scroll (pressing hotkey again scrolls to next keyword)\nBugfixes\n\n1.1.0\nJump and highlight a specific word on the page (click the word then use the next/previous button).\nBugfixes\n\n1.0.4 (Bugfix version)\n\n1.0.3\nHighlight markers on the scrollbar\nSmooth scrolling\nBugfixes\n\n1.0.2 (Bugfix version)"
