And surprise updates may roll out when you least expect it!\n\nPlease note that these custom reactions appear only to those who have installed this extension. So please spread the word!\n\nThis extensions was made by a fan and for the fans of Twin Peaks © Lynch/Frost & Twin Peaks Productions. Thumbs up to François Grante for showing the ropes.\n\nCHANGELOG\nv0.0.2 - Fixed a broken link\nv0.0.1 - Initial release\n\nTHE FACEBOOK REACTIONS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM!"
