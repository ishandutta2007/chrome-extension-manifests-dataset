The FIRE Speech Code Ratings extension connects to FIRE's Spotlight Database: FIRE's rating system for college and university speech codes. By navigating to a college or university website, a notification will appear if that college is listed in the Spotlight Database. Users have the option to quiet the notifications and can still check the rating by clicking the extension icon."
