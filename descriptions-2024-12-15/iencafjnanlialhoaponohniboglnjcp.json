It’s a way of thanking them for making great content. Once the user has reached a threshold level of hearts sent, the user is asked to make the payment for the no. of hearts given. The payment so received is appropriated amongst the content creators based on the no. of hearts assigned by the user. Thus, the Little Hearts application facilitates as a bridge between creators of content & their audience, through which the audience can support & monetize the creators' cause."
