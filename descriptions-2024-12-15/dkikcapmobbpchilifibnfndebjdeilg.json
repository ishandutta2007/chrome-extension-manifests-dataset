We are the local noticeboard that now spans 76 cities across 11 countries that connects not just new people arriving to a city but primarily the locals of those cities in - the UK, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Poland, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong - and are the biggest websites for local community classifieds including flat share, flat rentals, stuff for sale and jobs for majority of the countries mentioned.\n\nOur aim at Gumtree is to give you a simple and easy-to-use tool that lets you quickly find what you might be looking for. You can find everything you need to live your life with the help of your local Gumtree community; from that unique item at a bargain price to your dream machine, a job or a flat, a nanny for your kids, a cuddly pet to adopt or a language teacher and a tennis partner.\n\nIn 2005 we became part of the Kijiji family within eBay. Gumtree, Kijiji and now eBay Classifieds brands revolve around thriving online communities and so we hope to learn a lot from each other. Kijiji, which means \"village\" in Swahili, is a group of community classifieds websites similar to us found in more than 90 cities around the world where local communities like you connect with other locals in your area selling, buying, renting, adopting that cute pet, finding a job and even offering or looking for that service.\n\nHere's some official stuff:\n\nIf you have a suggestion for us then simply raise a ticket here and choose the appropriate suggestion subject line. We love feedback from you; for example, new cities and categories will be added as you suggest them.\nFor any questions or help on anything to do with Gumtree please click here to visit our Help section.\nPlease see our Terms of Use for more information on our working guidelines and policies.\n \n\nThanks for now,\n\nThe Gumtree People"
