The alarm will notify you through a sound alert and a notification.\nThe stopwatch feature helps you to use a stopwatch. This stopwatch even runs in the background and can be paused, played and reset.\nThe timer feature helps you to set a timer for a specific amount of time. When the time is up, you will be notified through a notification. This also runs in the background.\nLastly, we have the To-do list, where you can add, delete and check tasks. These tasks are stored even when chrome is shut down.\ncreators: Aaryan Mohta and Namra Shah.\nIf any bugs / glitches/ suggestions/queries,  \ncontact - timecloudext@gmail.com"
