Simply hover on a given stock cashtag in any of the Tweets in your feed and see real-time stock price, as well as additional data such as market cap, volume and shares outstanding. For cryptocurrencies, the extension also shows real-time stock prices as well as 24 hour High and Low price data and the 24hr volume for the cryptocurrency. \n\nUnlike other similar extensions, this extension does not open an external webpage for price and the extension does not require logging in to Twitter to see the prices. It does not require any permissions besides storage (so if you hover over a cashtag very frequently, instead of a new API call, the local storage shows the latest price data)"
