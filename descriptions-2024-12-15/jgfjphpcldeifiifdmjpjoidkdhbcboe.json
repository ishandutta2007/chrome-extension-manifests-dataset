What if I told you that bookmarks were insufficient and could be improved? I’m here to show you how :)\n \nWe usually add something valuable there, stuff we want to read later when we have time or not feeling lazy. It’s pretty usual for most of us that the “read later” folder is becoming “probably read later” and then finally “don’t know what’s here”. \n \nHow do we change it? Add the reminder to the link: set it up for the day you’re going to have some spare time, add a Mark to remind why you should do it. That’s the spirit!\n \nWhat about valueless stuff? Links we don’t want to open again. “Why would we want it?” - you’re going to ask. Fair question. Have you ever been looking for an apartment? You should know then how it is to open the same apartment every day forgetting that you rejected it (and why). Once again you open the photo of the bathroom: “Ah, yeah, this bath is ugly...”. Don’t worry, you’re going to open the same room again tomorrow, the title photo is so promising…\n\nNot with MarkALink! Add the link to the “Hide” group and forget about coming to this useless page henceforth. Whenever and wherever you see this link on the web, you’ll recognize it. And it’s only one of the cases where it could optimize your processes and save your time!"
