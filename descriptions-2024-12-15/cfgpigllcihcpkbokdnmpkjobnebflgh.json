First a little about me, I am a university student currently studying an MEng in Computer Science in the UK. I have been coding for the past 8 years and throughout that time I have been an avid creator and consumer of YouTube content. The reason for making this extension was to improve my experience when using YouTube and I have finally decided to submit this to the Chrome extension store in the hopes that it will aid you in the same way.\n\nFeatures\n¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\nRemove Subscription Videos - This feature makes it easier to delete unwanted videos from your YouTube homepage.\n\nRemove Watched Videos - This feature makes your homepage much cleaner by removing any subscription videos that you have already watched.\n\nYouTube Subscriptions as Default Page - Enable me if you want the 'Subscriptions' page as your default YouTube homepage.\n\nClear All Videos - This will delete all videos from your subscriptions page.\n\nLoad All Videos - Allows you to load *all* of your subscription videos into view.\n\nCollapse Subscription Groups - Allows you to toggle a the viewing of your subscription groups (Today, Yesterday, Last Week, etc).\n\nMore Information\n¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\nMore detailed descriptions, current issues and planned updates are available at https://github.com/Mattie432/YouTweak\n\nFinal Note\n¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\nIf you installed my extension and liked it a quick moment of your time to rate it would be most appreciated, equally if you didn't like it I would urge you to leave a comment explaining your concerns so that these can be addressed for future releases.\n\nAny bugs that are found should be reported to me through the GitHub issues page (https://github.com/Mattie432/YouTweak/issues).\n\nThanks Matt\n\nProgramming - @Mattie432\nGraphics - @getupWill"
