I am investigating and hope to have this fixed soon. A temporary workaround is to click the Bookmark Pro extension icon instead of using the keyboard shortcut.\n\nIf you're a power user of Chrome's basic bookmarks, then you're probably not very satisfied with the experience of saving bookmarks in Chrome.\n\nThis extension replaces Chrome's default Save Bookmark popup with a new popup experience that has modern, search-empowered features and a clean design. (Note: This extension does not work when using Google's newer Bookmark Manager extension.)\n\n+ Start typing to smart-search for a folder instead of digging through a menu for it.\n+ Choose from 3 recently-saved-to folders without searching for a folder at all.\n+ Create and save to a new folder without needing to open a new popup.\n+ Update the location or delete the bookmark if you've already saved the page.\n+ Elegantly designed using Google's new Material Design language.\n+ Highlighted a favorite quote? It'll automatically be prepended to the bookmark title.\n\nHow does it work? Keyboard shortcuts?\n+ Bookmark the same way you always have, whether through the Bookmarks menu, star icon, or keyboard shortcut (Mac: Cmd + D, Others: Ctrl+D)\n+ Tab to jump between inputs, ESC to escape, and Enter to Save, just as you'd expect."
