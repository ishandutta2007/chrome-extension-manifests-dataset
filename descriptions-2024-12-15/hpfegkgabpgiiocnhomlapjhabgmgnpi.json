This will help you stay focused and hopefully increase productivity.\n\nThe extension is inspired by Cal Newport's book \"Deep Work\" which states the importance of focused and concentrated work and the negative consequences of being distracted. He argues that to achieve the best results in any field, it's necessary to stay focused and undistracted for long periods of time (deep work sessions) and this is where the extension can be helpful. \n\nThe sessions can be configured through the extension's option page where it's possible to define sessions frequency and at what time it should start and end. It's also totally up to you to decide which websites should be blocked doing sessions."
