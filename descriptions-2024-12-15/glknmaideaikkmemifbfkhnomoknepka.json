Have the same experience chatting no matter if you are watching or are in offline chat.\n\nWe use events and data provided by the browser to overlay a native Chatterino window over the browser. The information includes the channel in which the user is in, as well as the size of the chat. Changing the tab or closing a window causes the Chatterino application to hide/show the window. Chatterino tracks the position and z-level of the Browser window and moves itself accordingly.\n\nNOTE:\n- This extension only works on Windows.\n- We need to overlay a native window over the browser window which is tricky by design and may not work for you setup."
