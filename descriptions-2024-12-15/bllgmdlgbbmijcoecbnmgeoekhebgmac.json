Click on the notification to instantly open the link in a new tab.\n\nCustomize #Clicky with multiple themes and even a Dark Mode!\n\nI believe your privacy is of utmost importance. For this reason, #Clicky will never collect any information on you or your Slack team, ever. See the Privacy Policy for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://github.com/joshfarrant/slack-clicky/wiki/Chrome-Extension-Privacy-Policy\n\nFAQ:\n\nâ€¢  Why does #Clicky request the permissions it does?\n\nI've gone into detail as to why #Clicky needs the permissions that it does in the link below, but the long and short of it is that #Clicky only requests the permissions from Slack that it needs to function.  Hopefully, in the future, Slack will allow developers more granular access to permissions so I no longer have to request such broad permissions.\n\nRest assured, however, that the Slack messages you send and receive are never sent anywhere, or stored in #Clicky. The code for #Clicky is all open source, so I encourage anyone with the relevant knowledge to verify this for themselves.\n\nMore info: https://github.com/joshfarrant/slack-clicky/issues/5\n\nCHANGELOG:\n\nMore recent changelogs available on GitHub.\n\nVersion 3.0.20 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Tweaked update messaging\n\nVersion 3.0.19 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Tweaked new permission messaging\n\nVersion 3.0.18 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Increased throttling further (#Clicky should now use way less CPU)\nâ€¢  Requested a new permission\n\nVersion 3.0.17 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Never published to store\n\nVersion 3.0.16 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Increased throttling (#Clicky should now use less CPU)\n\nVersion 3.0.15 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Removed logging\n\nVersion 3.0.14 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Bugfix\n\nVersion 3.0.13 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Bugfix\n\nVersion 3.0.12 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Behind-the-scenes tweaks.\n\nVersion 3.0.11 changelog:\n\nâ€¢  Behind-the-scenes tweaks.
