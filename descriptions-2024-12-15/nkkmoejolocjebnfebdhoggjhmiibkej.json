It seamlessly integrates with the YouTube user interface, adding intuitive upvote and downvote buttons directly beneath each video. These buttons are not just mere aesthetic additions; they serve a groundbreaking purpose. When clicked, they interact with a smart contract on the blockchain, currently operating on test networks, to record your vote.\n\nThis innovative approach harnesses the power of blockchain technology, ensuring that every interaction is transparently and immutably logged. The votes are not just ephemeral clicks but contribute to a permanent record on the blockchain, offering a new layer of interaction and feedback for content creators and viewers alike.\n\nLooking ahead, we're excited about the future developments of Peoples Choice Extender. Our roadmap includes the introduction of an aggregator platform. This will collate and display videos ranked by their accumulated upvotes and downvotes, providing an alternative, community-driven metric of popularity and engagement.\n\nAs an open-source and non-profit project, Peoples Choice Extender is committed to transparency and community involvement. Our goal is to revolutionize how viewers engage with content and support creators, leveraging blockchain technology to make viewer interactions count in a whole new way. Join us in shaping the future of online content engagement!"
