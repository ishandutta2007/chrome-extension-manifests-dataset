Which allows you to block websites, subpages, and even just words for the URLs you visit online.\n\nSapphire is very flexible, with both a black- and whitelist, so you can for example block example.com but allow subsite.example.com or example.com/site.\n\nYou can also choose any website / URL that you want to be redirected to when a site is blocked. \n\nSapphire also comes with a built-in focus mode, which makes it harder to turn Sapphire off, and allows you to track how much time you have spent being productive.\n\nEnjoy Sapphire :)"
