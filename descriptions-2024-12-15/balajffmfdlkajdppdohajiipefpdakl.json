By automatically and privately keeping track of the political bias of articles you read and links you see across the web, you understand others better, and hopefully, help depolarize the political climate. \n\nThis way this works is determined tracking your visits to any site ranked by AllSides, the links to news sites ranked by AllSides that appeared on your browser, and those site’s corresponding bias ratings: left, leans left, center, leans right, right, or mixed. Privacy and transparency are important, so none of the data this extension collects ever leaves this device - promise (it’s open source so you can check the source code ). \n\nAll rankings come from AllSides, and are updated semi-regularly by the developer. This is a single developer shop, so please send any and all feedback, and I'd be happy to improve your experience with the extension. Thanks!"
