You can switch between RGB and HEX and copy the result to clipboard.\n\nDimensions - just slide over your image to see dimensions of each element real-time.\n\nMeasure - select an area and this tool will tell you it's value in pixels.\n\nZoom - zoom in and out for more precision.\n\nWe're constantly improving the existing tools and thinking about some cool new features to help frontend developers. \nPlease, leave us feedback if you think this tool might be useful for you!"
