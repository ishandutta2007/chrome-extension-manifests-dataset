Similarly, some answers on sites like Stack Overflow link to old versions of the documentation. \n\npg_docs_bot helps you avoid the annoyance of having to click \"Current\" when you get there, the frustration of having read the whole page before realising it was an old version, or even not realising that it was an out of date version.\n\nFeatures:\n* Redirects links to the \"current\" version\n* After redirecting, displays a notice (including a link to the page you were redirected from)\n* Avoids redirecting some deprecated features (to avoid 404s)\n* Doesn't redirect when coming from another page in the docs, so you can still check old versions (the main problem with generic redirectors)\n\nLimitations:\n* Only supports redirecting to \"current\"\n* Works for the English language docs\n* Works for version 7.0 links upwards\n* Chrome extension works on a limited list of search engines and stack exchange sites (to avoid needing <all_urls> permission)"
