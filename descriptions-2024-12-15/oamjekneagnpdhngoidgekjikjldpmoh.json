With BlackoutBars, teachers can display student progress on the smartboard or share it with students without giving away the answers. The extension works by hiding the colored bars that indicate if a student's answer is right or wrong, preventing students from cycling through the possible answer choices or guessing until the bar turns green next to their name.\n\nBlackoutBars provides an answer-agnostic way to monitor student progress and is perfect for promoting academic integrity in the classroom. By eliminating the visual cues that reveal the correctness of student responses, BlackoutBars helps to ensure that students are engaging with the material and not simply guessing their way through assessments.\n\nInstall BlackoutBars today and experience a new level of answer-neutralized progress monitoring!\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/innovat-ed/home"
