You can also click on the extension icon (the black S inside the magnifying glass) to upload an image you have on your computer.\n\nWhether you search by right-clicking or by uploading an image, you will see that the results will appear instantly.\n\nThe extension also allows you to search by product ID, for example 1736224. We added this functionality because currently Shein's search engine does not show results if you search by code.\n\nFor example, if someone posts on Instagram that a Zara dress has an identical clone on Shein whose ID is 1435253, just click on the extension icon, hit By ID, and enter the code you're interested in and the extension will redirect you to the product page immediately.\n\nDisclaimer: this extension may collect cashback from purchases where the user has not claimed it. This does not involve any extra cost to the user and lets us earn a few cents per purchase which help fund our service."
