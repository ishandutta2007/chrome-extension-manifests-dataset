But, the scriptures from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints do not feature references to General Conference talks.  What if you could see the number of times a scripture verse has been referenced in General Conference talks and click through to read what the speaker had to says about that scripture?\n\nCreating footnote buttons between scriptures from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and General Conference talks is what the Gospel Genius is for!  Buttons represent the number of times a scripture appears as a footnote on General Conference Talks.  Clicking the Gospel Genius verse buttons will display a table of links to General Conference Talks with that scripture verse in the footnotes.  Use the Gospel Genius settings tab to change the colors of the verse buttons and use the \"Apostles only\" setting to only view footnotes from General Conference talks by Apostles of the Church.  The Gospel Genius is an excellent way to deepen scripture study by combining the scriptures from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints with the words of living Prophets.\n\nEnhance your study of the Come Follow Me program from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints using the Gospel Genius!  This extension is designed to create verse button in the chapter navigator and footnote sections of the Church's website.  Does the Come Follow Me Lesson for this week reference a scripture quoted frequently in General Conference?  Want to know what Prophets and Apostles have to say about this week's Come Follow Me reading?  The Gospel Genius can help!\n\nThe Gospel Buddy is an extension for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS Church).  The Gospel Buddy can quickly lead to more in depth study of General Conference talks and Come Follow Me lessons.\n\nIncludes footnotes to all talks as recent as:  April 2024"
