You can edit the text/word that will replace the number by clicking on the icon of the extension in the top right corner of your browser. \n\nFor example, when this extension is activated, you won't see recipes' caloric information. This also works with Deliveroo so you can use it to order food without triggering yourself!\n\nDisclaimer: It takes 1-3 seconds to actually hide the number (depending on the website) after the page is displayed so keep that in mind as you browse. I'm working on fixing it but in the meantime, what I do is I look away for a bit while the page loads.\n\nNote: This extension isn't perfect, nutritional information is displayed in a lot of different ways by different websites. I did my best to cover the most common cases. However, if ever you see a site/situation where the censoring doesn't work, please comment or email me the details! That way, I can improve the accuracy of the extension for you and everyone else :)\n\nFor support please contact the creator: Mayze (mayzetx@gmail.com)\n\nCredit: Inspired from ElementHider and Travis Woodward's ReplaceR"
