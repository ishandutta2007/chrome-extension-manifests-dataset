I also don’t usually watch videos in the order I added them to my Watch Later playlist. Instead of trying to hack YouTube’s massive amounts of JavaScript, this plugin does exactly what I need.\n\nThis extension doesn't track any of your data usage, and is open sourced at https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/dont-watch-later"
