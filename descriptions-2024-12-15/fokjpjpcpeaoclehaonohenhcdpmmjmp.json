Sometimes you think you are in a legit website when actually you are in a scam copy of a legit website, you can be at an ecommerce store that is not real and has fake 5 star reviews, you can be at a news website with false information and many more bad situationsâ€¦ What all of these websites have in common is the ability to isolate themselves of feedback from real users. This makes the scam possible, because everyone can get to the website but no one can share their personal experience with that website. Even if there is information about this website it is very hard to find. What Vitri wants to accomplish is to give the user a different browsing experience, transforming every single website that exists in a community, just like what it would be a subreddit, where people can post things related to that website. \nVitri also makes it very easy to find this information. \nThe way you find the website's community on Vitri is very simple. Just clicking on our chrome extension popup, you will be prompted with recent posts for that website. Right now you can comment on posts, upvote posts and check the users posts so you can have more transparency about the user who is posting and commenting.\nThis opens a world of opportunities to users. Consider that you are at your college's website trying to print a document of some sort, but you can't figure it out where you should go to do that. In this case you can pop open Vitri extension and see if anyone had that problem already or even ask it yourself.\nNo website is too small for Vitri, if there is no posts on the website community Vitri will tell you, but you can always be the first to post, and basically this way, to create that community."
