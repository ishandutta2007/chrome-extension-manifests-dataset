To win the game, guide the red dot through a white tunnel surrounded by brick walls, aiming for the green exit. Be cautious of the vertical barriers that move up and down. These obstacles have random lengths, evenly spaced across the tunnel. They bounce back when they hit the top or bottom of the game area, sometimes overlapping, which can make their movements harder to predict and the game more challenging.\n\nNavigate carefully around the moving barriers to reach the end. A helpful strategy is to move past one blocker and pause briefly before tackling the next one. Progressing slowly and steadily between obstacles is the key to improving your success rate. Stay calm and patient to master the maze!\n\nTo enhance your experience and add extra fun, we've included a full-screen option and displayed our featured products after game over.
