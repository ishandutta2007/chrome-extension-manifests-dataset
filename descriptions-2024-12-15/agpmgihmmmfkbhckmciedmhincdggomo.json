For example, you may have a keyboard and mouse at home, other devices at work, and a mobile mouse when you’re on the go – all can be connected to the same Logitech Unifying receiver and be instantly ready to use.\n\nAdd devices to your Unifying receiver.\n\nThis software will allow you to add or remove compatible mice, keyboards and other devices to your unifying receiver.\n\nThe tiny receiver stays plugged in.\n\nBecause the Unifying receiver is so small, you can leave it permanently plugged into your notebook and it only uses one USB port, so you’ll have ports free for other things.\n\nSupported platforms: Chrome OS, Mac OS, Windows\nNot officially supported: Linux"
