This window runs no extensions, so it will protect you from extension-based web filters, such as allowing you to bypass Securly. Unlike similar apps, this application blends in better on Chromebooks and allows you to open multiple windows! It also includes an omnibox that uses Google Search.\n\nPlease note: This app has no effect if sites are blocked via the wireless access point. It only opens a window without extensions running. If it does not work, then you need to use a proxy or VPN.\n\nwww.paypal.me/Typicalness\n\n\nFuture goals:\n- support new tab function with current windows\n- create tab system rather than just different windows\n- incorporate VPN\n- ???"
