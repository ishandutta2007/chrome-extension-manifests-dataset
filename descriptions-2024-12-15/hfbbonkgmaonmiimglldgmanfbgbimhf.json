This will NOT work if you use the overlay (though in some ways maybe the best thing this can do for you is make you disable the overlay).\n\nAdds a search bar that allows you to jump to modules on the admin/module screen.  Will also allow you to change the dependency lists into links so you can jump to the various dependencies with a single click.\n\nFor permissions, it provides collapsible sections, a way to add each permission to all roles and some node actions for the permissions screen.  Also displays the machine name of the permission.\n\nFor context, it provides better theming for the sidebar in reactions and displays the module and delta for each block.\n\nMore features to come.  Contributions welcome at https://github.com/jec006/drupalhelper\n\n\nRelease Notes:\n0.6\nAdded better support for sites installed in subdirectories\nAdded context block niceties\n\n0.5\nAdd permissions features.\n\n0.4 \nAdded /admin/modules/list to the injected pages\nUpdated some theming to be more consistant\nAdded better support for themes other than rubik and seven"
