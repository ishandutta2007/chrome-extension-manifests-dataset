It also allows you to have sortable shortcuts to your favourite websites!\n\nAll the notes and shortcuts are stored offline on your computer. You can export/import data to/from a file. You and only you are in control of your data! Preview is here https://sereneinserenade.github.io/placenoter , all the data in the preview is non-persistent.\n\nA peak to the palace of features this extension has to offer: \n\nShortcuts 🔗: Sortable shortcuts to your websites.\nEasy-to-use 🍰: Open new tab and start writing.\nAuto-save 🔄: Never worry about saving your data, it does that automatically.\nTheme 💻⚫️⚪️: Great support for system/light/dark theme, so you can work late in the night or midday without stressing your eyes!\nBlocks ⠿ ⬆️ ⬇️ : Notion like draggable/movable blocks.\nSecure 🔐: No data is sent to any server whatsoever, it always lies on your computer, and you can export it to a JSON file at will.\nRecycle Bin ♻️: Notes that you deleted live in recycle bin unless deleted permanently.\nWrite code snippets in note and choose from ~35 different languages 🧑‍💻: Great for programmers/developers/coders!!\nIt's open-source and free ❤️!
