Being a heavy user — and a huge fan — of RYM since 2010, I realised that one extra feature would be tremendously helpful: the possibility of seeing your rating (to any album), on any RYM page where that album was linked, for instance: charts, lists, comment boxes, artists or record label profiles, genre pages, or profile pages from any RYM user (including yours).\n\nWith this extra feature, there's no more need to open dozens (sometimes hundreds) of new tabs for each album you find on a list just to check whether you've listened to that album already, or which rating you gave to it."
