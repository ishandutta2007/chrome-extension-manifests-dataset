Increase productivity and never get lost in the sea of videos again!\n\nThis is an open-source browser extension, created to help you (and me!) with serious study/learning/focus sessions.  The source code can be found on the chrome-official branch here: https://github.com/emdh-dev/study-mode-youtube/\n\nCurrent Features:\n-Remove all videos on YouTube's homepage.\n-Remove the notifications bell.\n-Remove sidebar videos (will also disable autoplay, the recommended video wall after a video ends, and will put the video in theater mode).\n-Remove all comments.\n\n\nOpen this extension in Firefox browser's toolbar (same icon you see on this page) and select any option you wish to apply to your current tab of YouTube - you can apply as many options as you'd like! These options are only immediately applied to your current tab. If you want to apply these changes to any other tab or window with YouTube open, open this browser extension again (no need to re-select the checkboxes), and all changes will be immediately applied!\n\nUnchecking any option will refresh the page you are on in order to restore the content that was originally there.\n\n\nPermissions\n\nUser data is not maliciously accessed by this extension - I am a user of this extension too, and believe heavily in the protection of users' privacy and personal data.\n\nBelow is an explanation of permissions in Study Mode: YouTube, with definitions copied from Mozilla's developer page.\n\nactiveTab: If an extension has the activeTab permission, then when the user interacts with the extension, the extension is granted extra privileges for the active tab only.\n\nactiveTab is used in order to apply user-input changes to the current tab of YouTube.\nlocalStorage is also used in this extension and is used to store the options you have selected in the extension for future access - both in new tabs, and in new windows. Access and retrieval of only these customization options are used.\n\nContact\n\nI have put a lot of effort into this extension, however, you may encounter a bug or issue. If you do, please email me at EMDHdev@gmail.com with the browser that you are using Study Mode: YouTube in, as well as a description of what is happening (and screenshot, if applicable).\n\nMy goal is to make this extension as useful as possible for every user, and your feedback will help greatly! Feel free to email me about any desired features you have and feedback about this extension - I'll be reading them all!\n\nAdditional features coming soon!"
