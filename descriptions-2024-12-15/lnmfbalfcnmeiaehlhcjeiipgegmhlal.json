You can use your own designs for the center image and particles (small images work best.) The particles dance around based on one of several formations. Speed and size can be altered along with formation specific attributes like distance. \n\nThe app can run full screen and the user interface can be hidden to mimic a colorful screensaver. There is a random formation setting, as well as an automatic button that changes the many parameters over time.\n\nAdditionally, the overall wallpaper size (number of particles) can be picked from 3 different sizes depending on what your device can handle.  \n\nFinally, click the camera button to save an image."
