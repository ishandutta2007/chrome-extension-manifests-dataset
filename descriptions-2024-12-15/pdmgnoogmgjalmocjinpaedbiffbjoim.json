Not much to tell about it, just check the screenshots and try it out ;-) . And once you do, make sure to check the option page! Like seriously, check the option page! If you don't you will be missing out on so much stuff!\n\nIf you have features you would love to see, just let me know by writing a review. Just for the record, I will *not* be implementing premium member features for normal members, because that's Crunchyroll's fair right to add or hide.\n\nDon't know how to get to the options page? You can get there through the google chrome menu as well, but if that's too hard: Just copy and paste the following link: chrome-extension://pdmgnoogmgjalmocjinpaedbiffbjoim/optionLauncher.html"
