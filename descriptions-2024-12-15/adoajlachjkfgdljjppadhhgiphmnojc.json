The advancement of technology into the 21st century has seen users becoming increasingly vulnerable to invasions of privacy through their personal data. All the while, knowledge and education on the subject of data privacy remains niche; often only through headlines of scandals or security breaches, are discussions of data privacy brought to the mainstream. \n\nMy Online Identity (MOI) aims to educate you of the potential risks of information sharing and empowers you to control what can be controlled when sharing your information on the web. MOI outlines what information is being shared, why it is being shared and why you should care about who has your information. MOI makes it easy for you to control what permissions big business can have about you."
