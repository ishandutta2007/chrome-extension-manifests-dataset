Creating a schedule for the next semester can be a tedious and time-consuming task. This extension aims to eliminate this entirely by taking what you do every semester, and packing it into a simple process that executes in seconds. \n\nHow does it work? Schedules are created by specifying how a schedule should look like, and then creating all possible schedules based on those restrictions. Waking up too early for classes? Configure your schedules to start at a later time and any possible schedule will be created. By customizing how you want your schedules to look, you can find the perfect schedule in minutes.\n\nAt first, this extension might look confusing, but takes only one or two runs to understand its full functionality. Stuck? Simply look at the detailed usage page included, which walks you through all features of the extension. No longer spend hours of creating schedules by hand, instead spend seconds through this powerful extension."
