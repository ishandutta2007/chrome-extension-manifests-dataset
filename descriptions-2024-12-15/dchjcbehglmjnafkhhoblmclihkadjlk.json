Our flexible, lease-to-own solution provides a new alternative to traditional financing.   \n\n~ Choose an online retailer ~\nVisit the Acima MarketPlace™, and select where you’d like to shop from some of your favorite online retailers*. You can also choose from over 15,000 in-store locations if you’d rather shop in person.\n\n~ Enjoy $300 to $4,000 of shopping power ~\nGet approved up-front so you know what you can spend or just start adding eligible items to your cart. You can then apply (if you haven’t already done so), sign your agreement, and setup an initial payment.\n\n~ Check out with Acima ~\nUse the card info on the virtual Acima LeasePay Card™ and your billing address on your Acima application to complete the payment transaction during store checkout.\n\n\n*Even though Acima is not affiliated with or sponsored by the retailers, our Browser Extension provides you with Acima’s lease-to-own options at checkout when you shop at certain online retailers. Only certain products are eligible for lease. Acima’s browser extension cannot be used for in-store purchases.\n \nThe advertised transaction is a rental-purchase agreement (rent-to-own agreement, consumer rental-purchase agreement or a lease/lease-purchase agreement, depending on your state) with Acima. Ownership is optional. You will not own the merchandise until the total amount necessary to acquire ownership is paid in full or you exercise your early purchase option. See your lease agreement for payment amounts and rental terms.\n\n\"The No Credit Option\" means this is not a credit, loan, or financing transaction. It does not mean or imply no inquiry will be made of credit history or creditworthiness. We consider multiple data points in reviewing your application and regularly approve customers with less than perfect credit history."
