This extension helps users build/archive/share collections about local events or stories collected from local news media outlets. For example, given a zip code \"70115\" and a query \"flooding,\" the extension will collect local stories from media outlets that serve New Orleans, LA, by searching Google. The extension also lets you search Google news and filter based on minimum and maximum dates. After building a collection, you can also save locally (JSON or list) or remotely in exchange for a shareable link, as well as archive your locally built collection in exchange for a shareable short link. It also enables the extraction of links from Google Search Result Pages (SERPs) and Twitter."
