Visit the support tab above to leave feedback.\n\nMain Points\n- Supports Classic and Lightning.\n- Gives a popup of the users listed on the user listing page so you can select to login as a different user on any page.\n- When a user is selected, it logs you in as that user and keeps you on the page you were viewing.\n- When you log out, it will take you back to the page you were originally on when you logged in as the other user.\n\nAdditional Points\n- Above the user list in the popup, the \"View\" dropdown is available so you can change to another view from the user listing page.\n- Only the first 4 columns from the user listing table are shown by default (including the login column) since the popup has a limited width.  A \"All Columns\" button is available if you can't identify the user you need by the default columns shown.\n\nUpdates\n6/14/2019 - Now supports lightning\n7/8/2015 - Added Filter textbox for quickly finding users\n4/23/2012 - Now works with emea accounts\n4/1/2012 - Now works with custom Salesforce domains"
