Just open the extension on the top right of your browser and the game starts automatically! Use arrow keys or WASD to move the glider up and down and go through the gaps to increase your score. Be careful though, because you speed up the higher your score is. Level up at score 20 and score 40 and survive the longest possible!\n\nPatch notes:\n- Procedurally generated clouds! ‚òÅ\n- You can show your high score to your friends now!\n- Minor changes to game rules\n- Fixed shooting bug which caused the glider to shoot too fast sometimes\n(version 0.0.0.4 is skipped as it started on the wrong level and I had to upload a new zip file with a higher version number.)\n\nCOMING SOON IN THE NEXT UPDATE:\n- Improved graphics\n\nPlease contact me ( updownglidercontact@gmail.com ) if you find any bugs. Have fun!"
