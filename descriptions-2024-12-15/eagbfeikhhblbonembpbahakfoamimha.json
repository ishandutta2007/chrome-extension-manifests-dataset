It is designed to be used together with the Netflix streaming service.\n\nThe extension modifies Netflix customer experience for viewing movies and shows in foregn languages. Different viewing modes are provided that make learning a foreign language fun and easy. Fun, because the user himself chooses his favorite movies and series. Easy, because you do not need to use a dictionary to translate each word.\n\n1. Slideshow mode.\n\nThis mode splits the movie into short fragments. There is a pause between each fragment. During the pause still images from the just seen frament are shown with interactive subtitles overlayed over each image. The user can easily look up the translation of any single word by clicking on it or can translate everything on the shown image by clocking on a corresponding icon. The translation of the entire phrase makes it possible to understand the meaning of each word in context. Additionally spoken phrases can be repeated as many times as needed by clicking on the sound icon.\n\n2. Automatic subtitle translation.\n\nOften there are situations when you want to watch a movie or series, but there are no necessary subtitles.\n\n3. Uploading external subtitles.\n\nThis mode allows you to upload and use external subtitles when there are no required subtitles on Netflix, or the quality of the automatic subtitle translation mode is not satisfactory."
