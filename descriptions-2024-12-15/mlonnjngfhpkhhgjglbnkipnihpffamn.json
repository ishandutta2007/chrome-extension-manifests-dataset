Its purpose is to prompt reflection on the finite nature of time and the importance of not squandering it. \n\nHopefully every glance at your new tab helps you take action and take full advantage of the days, weeks, and months ahead - instead of being lost in the rush of day-to-day life. \n\nAdditionally, you have the option to record your accomplishments thus far and outline future aspirations. This feature acts as a source of inspiration during moments of doubt or apathy. \n\nInspired by Paras Chopra."
