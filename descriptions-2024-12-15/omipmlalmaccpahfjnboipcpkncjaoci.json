KeepTabs will keep track of tabs that have not been used for a certain period of time and delete them for you. Simply add the number of minutes a tab should stay unused until it is deleted in the popup window and continue using the browser as normal! Note that tabs must be on the same window in order for the extension to function properly. Also you can have the extension ask you for permission before deleting any tabs by clicking the checkbox in the popup window!"
