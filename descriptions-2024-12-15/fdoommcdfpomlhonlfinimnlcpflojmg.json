It calculates GPA, and the effects an imagined grade would have on their current grade\n\nGPA Calculator:\n\n\"Automatic\" Function:\nThe user has to open the popup, and press the \"GPA Calculator\" button while the \"StudentVUE Marking Period 4\" page is open in the browser. Then, the user must select the weight for each class. (Ex. Hon English 9 is an \"Honors/Dual Enrollment\" class while AP World History 1 is an \"AP/IB/Industry Certification\" class). If the user wants to add a course they have taken before this year, they simply have to input the course information and select \"Add Course\". Then, when the user is finished, they should hit the \"Submit\" button and their GPA will be displayed on the screen.\n\n\"Manual\" Function:\nSame as \"automatic\" function, except the program does not draw from the StudentVUE Webpage, and the user inputs all of the classes manually. \n\nGrade Calculator:\n\n\"Automatic\" Function:\nThe user has to open the popup, and press the \"Grade Calculator\" button while a StudentVUE Class page is open in the browser. The user inputs the information about the imagined assignment, the points earned, points possible, and weight of the assignment. Then, after clicking the submit button, the program calculates what grade the user would have if they were to get the inputted grade on that assignment, in that class.\n\n\"Minimum\" Function:\nThe user has to open the popup, and press the \"Grade Calculator\" button while a StudentVUE Class page is open in the browser. The user inputs the information about an assignment they will do/have done, but is not currently in the gradebook (Ex. A test the user just took) Then, the user inputs information about the assignment, points possible and it's weight on their grade, then, the user inputs the grade they're trying to earn (Ex. 89.5, if the user has an 88.5) and the program calculates what the user would have to earn on that assignment to achieve the grade they want.\n\n\"Manual\" Function:\nSame as \"automatic\" function, but the program does not draw from StudentVUE webpage, so the user must input, information about their current grade in the same weighted category of the new assignment as the new assignment, points earned, points possible, weight of category, and weight of other categories."
