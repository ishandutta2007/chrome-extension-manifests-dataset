It's just 3 steps:\n\n1) Download this extension.\n2) Install Houston. Sign up at turbinelabs.io.\n3) Modify the end of your CI/CD pipeline to deploy new versions side-by-side, as if you're going to do a blue/green release.\n\nHouston supports virtually any infrastructure and any CI/CD tool. Read more at docs.turbinelabs.io.\n\nIf you want to see how the team at Turbine Labs uses the Houston Cookie Manager, see our blog post! https://blog.turbinelabs.io/eating-our-own-dogfood-35d017343bce\n\nNOTE: Requires a Houston account. Sign up at turbinelabs.io/contact.\n\nABOUT HOUSTON: Houston, by Turbine Labs, is a continuous release service that lets you roll out new software versions incrementally and roll back bad code within seconds when something is wrong. Houston gives teams observability into their releases with detailed metrics from both old and new versions, based on real customer traffic and native integrations into Kubernetes, Consul, AWS ECS, EC2, and more. Houston lets teams improve their product velocity without any disruption––inside the company or out."
