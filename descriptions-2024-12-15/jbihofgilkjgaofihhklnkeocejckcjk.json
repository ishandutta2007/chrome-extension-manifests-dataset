The \"container*\" should represent the context (at what time\\from where\\i consume\\what information) \n\n  *In the theory of publishing, framing (encapsulation) is used to support the subsequent filtering (classification & search), amplification (propagation) and models (value distribution).\n\n\n  - Block-building writing experience\n\n  This block-building writing experience is classic in some note-taking tools like roamresearch, I'm a big beneficiary of it. Generally speaking, I write in block units and every block has its unique ID, so when i write an article i can combine those blocks with context â€”â€”we call it \"block reference\".\n\n  So, you will see an article from a bunch of static text to \"a chain of blocks\" with their individual context."
