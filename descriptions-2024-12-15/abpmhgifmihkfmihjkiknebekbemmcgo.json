Completing a trade with the red banner will not credit you skins on the P2P trading site you are using under any circumstance.\n\nThe only time you want to complete a red banner trade is if you know this trade is for something else. (i.e. you are trading with a friend for something unrelated to P2P trading).\n\n2) A green banner trade means you are safe to make the trade and you will be credited on the P2P trade site you are using. The trade should pop up automatically in most cases for you to accept. \n\n3) Enjoy!!\n\nBy using this add-on, you agree to the P2P Trade Manager Terms & Conditions available at https://www.wtfskins.com/tos"
