Ability to open nested previews from already open ones. Unlike other extensions, you don't have to open the page from preview in a new tab to preview links from there. Also, a nested preview opens not inside the parent one, but on top of it, which means it is not limited by its size.\n\n2. Convenient resize and move the preview window, and also the page zoom inside it. Zoom in on the page you're viewing as usual by pressing Ctrl and scrolling the mouse wheel.\n\n3. Support for entering in the address bar: enter the address of the site you want to go to, or a search query. By default, the search query will be sent to Google, but you can choose another search engine or add your own.\n\n4. Open cross-domain links without disabling clickjacking protection. Let's say you have a Google site open in a tab, and you want to open a Yahoo site in the preview. In many preview extensions you won't be able to do this due to browser limitations. In others you can, but only because they disable protection and put you at risk. But in Advanced Link Preview you can open such links without disabling protection, which means you will be safe.\n\n\nAttention: after installing the extension, before trying to test it, reload the page on which you will do it."
