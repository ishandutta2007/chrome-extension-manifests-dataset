It's as simple as it looks: it's empty, it's new and it's black. This is the best you can get till the web extension api is fully supported by Chromie and significant details about your currently installed theme like background color and image become available so that we can develop better and more functional new tab pages. Until then, may His Merciful Shadow fall upon new!"
