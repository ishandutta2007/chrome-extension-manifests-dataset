But not all take-aways are equal, and some may have quite shocking standards of hygiene.\n\nThis plug in hopes to make picking the ideal take-away even easier by displaying the result of the food safety inspection score against each take-away on just-eat.co.uk, hungryhouse.co.uk and fillmybelly.com, making choosing what take-away to use even easier. I mean, you're not going to choose a 4 over a 0 are you?\n\nTo see the ratings, just do a postcode search on just-eat.co.uk or hungryhouse.co.uk and you'll see the rating below each take-away. Please note: you may not see ratings against every take-away, but this may be improved in future."
