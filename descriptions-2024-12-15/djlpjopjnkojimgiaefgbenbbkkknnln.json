As soon as the alarm is triggered, the given link gets opened in a new tab (You can even manage the start time in the Settings tab according to your convenience). It will Auto Join the meeting (with mic and camera off) and will also Auto Leave the meeting for you.\n\nTo use the auto join feature, turn on the Auto Join switch in the Settings tab and change the User Account to the number corresponding to the account using which you want to join the meeting. The image added for your reference shows that the account corresponding to IIT Jodhpur has index 2 and hence one should select 2 in the User Account drop-down list if they want to use that account. Same logic applies to any other account a user might want to use.\nSimilarly, for the Auto Leave function to work, the Auto Leave switch must be on in the Settings Tab.\n\nThe alarms are categorized according to Today, Tomorrow and Later in the Upcoming Tab. You can even turn them off by just clicking on the green tick-mark besides the alarm.\nThe Meet Scheduler switch on the top of the pop-up is a switch for the entire extension. If you turn that off, the extension won't trigger any alarm for you.\n\nThis project is open sourced at https://github.com/devlup-labs/meet-scheduler\nFeel free to collaborate and contribute to the project!\n\n- Made with <3 by Devlup Labs"
