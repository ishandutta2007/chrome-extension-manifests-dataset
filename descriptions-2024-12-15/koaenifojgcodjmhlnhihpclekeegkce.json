NzbDrone Xtender will add links to 3rd Party Search Providers for each episode in the Episode Search Modal window. These links will spawn a search (opening in a new tab) for each episode you click. Clicking a link will open the respected search site in a new window and pass in the required search parameters for you. This can save valuable time, as you no longer have to manually open an new tab, type in the search providers web address, fill in the search box, and submit the form.
