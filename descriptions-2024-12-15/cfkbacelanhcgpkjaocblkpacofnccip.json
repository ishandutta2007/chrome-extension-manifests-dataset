Improve your Reddit experience and stay informed.\n\nThis extension automatically adds the publication date of linked articles to each Reddit post, helping you quickly understand the freshness and context of the content being shared. Perfect for users who want to make informed decisions about the relevance and timeliness of news and articles.\n\nKey Features:\n\n  •  Instant date display: See the publication date of articles linked in Reddit posts without needing to click through.\n  •  Customizable: Configure exactly how you'd like publication dates to be formatted. Dates can even be color-coded so you can easily tell whether a post is outdated or fresh at a glance.\n  •  Works on all versions of Reddit: The design of the publish date label is automatically set to fit with the rest layout on both new and old Reddit.\n\nHow it Works:\n\n  •  The extension checks the link in each Reddit post, attempts to retrieve the original publication date of the article, and displays it next to the post if one is found.\n  •  Works on articles from news sites, blogs, research papers, and more.\n\n\nPrivacy Note: This extension does not collect any personal data about you or your Reddit account. Although it only runs when you're on Reddit, it connects to external websites linked from Reddit to search for publication dates."
