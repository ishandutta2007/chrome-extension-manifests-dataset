The tiles are larger, so easier to click on than the usual browser tabs.\n\nNow includes touch support if you have a device with touch capability.\n\nIt also allows navigating through the tabs using the keyboard, using the left and right keys. Press Enter to select a tab.\n\nOther features include:\n\nType-to-search: start typing to enter keywords in the tabtiles address bar, press Enter to search.\n\nChoose when to display the bar: for normal restored windows, when maximized or in full screen mode. And / or auto-hide when not in use.\n\nCustomize the size of the bar, to a percentage of the window height.\n\nShow popup hints, containing the full title and address of the page.\n\n--\n\nCheck out my other extension - search the web store for Last Tab Back.\n\n--\n\nRelease history:\n\n0.9.3 Added touch support to allow scrolling left and right through tabs. Also re-enabled lasttabback integration after some fixes\n0.9.2 Disable lasttabback integration for now\n0.9.1 Update to Manifest V3 and add bug fixes\n0.9.0 Hide when viewing some media players full screen\n0.8.13: Changed to allow clicking through to the page in areas where there aren't any tabs; now shows Untitled for pages with no title, and PDF Document for .pdf files - to allow the pdf viewer buttons to be clicked more easily\n0.8.12 - Manually disable type-to-search or keyboard tab navigation; now allows 1-pixel activation height for auto-hide mode; set interval for hiding or switching back to mini mode; middle mouse button closes tab.\n0.8.11 - Selected tab now has extra highlighting to make it easier to quickly locate. Fixed a bug where mouse clicks outside of the bar sometimes select a different tab when the button is released (i.e. when the mouse button was held down and then released at a different location).\n0.8.10 - Changed to allow specifying the percentage size of mini mode compared to normal; also to allow setting the popup hint to \"centered\"\n0.8.9 - The first (leftmost) button now shows the time and date in a hint. When using the wheel to move through tabs, mouse movement is deactivated until moved by a small amount.\n0.8.8 - Added a history button within the address bar. Delete can now be pressed to close non-selected tabs when in keyboard navigation (left / right) mode. Fixed a bug that was preventing selecting tabs correctly if somehow no tab was selected\n0.8.7 - Minor fixes for the new pinning integration\n0.8.6 - Disabled displaying when printing the page (ie. on paper)\n0.8.5 - Added support for pinning tabs - right click twice to do this\n0.8.4 - Fixed minor zoom bug (not related to standard chrome zoom)\n0.8.3 - Fixed a bug that caused the bar to go off screen at some chrome zoom levels\n0.8.2 - Fixed bug in hide when right clicking the address bar close button\n0.8.1 - Moving the mouse will cause the bar to be displayed, if it hasn't already. This helps with delays caused when the page being viewed tries to refer to slow / offline third party \nsites. Also, minor bug fixes\n0.8.0 - Updated the button layout; click to close now snaps partly off-screen tiles to edges; fixed bugs relating to the bar not being displayed on some sites, and being damaged by chrome's translate feature\n0.7.4 - Now allows address bar navigation to a new tab for both URL and search keywords; click-to-close message for selected tab is smaller for narrow tabs; fixed minor bugs\n0.7.3 - Fixed a problem resizing tiles after some are closed (and auto-hide is enabled)\n0.7.2 - Corrected issues regarding switching between mini and normal mode - wasn't re-sizing as intended\n0.7.1 - Fixed bug where right-hand item does not correctly focus\n0.7.0 - Initial release"
