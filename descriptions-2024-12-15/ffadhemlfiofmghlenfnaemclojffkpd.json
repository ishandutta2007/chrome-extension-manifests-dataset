View YouTube video page in chrome\n2. Select a caption file in the box under the title\n\nYou can turn off the caption by pressing the switch next to the box.\n\n\nHere's how to write a caption file. It's the format of the srt file.\n\n```text\n1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560\nこれは字幕ファイルから読み取った字幕です。\n\n2\n00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,700\nThis is a test video\n```\n\n1. Write timestamp for start time and end time of the text to be displayed\n2. Write the text one line below the timestamp\n\nTimestamp is written like `hh:mm:ss,sss --> hh:mm:ss,sss`.\n`hh` is the hour, `mm` is the minute, `ss` is second, and `sss` is millisecond.\n`:` is a delimiter for `hh`, `mm` and `ss`,\nand `,` is a delimiter for `hh:mm:ss` and `sss`.  \nStart time, ` --> `, and end time, in that order.  \n\nActually, if it's written in this format,\nyou don't have to worry about the file extension."
