These videos include personalized recommendations, based on the viewer’s previous watches, and videos that are topically related.\n\nIs There an Algorithm For Suggested Video Optimization?\nWell, actually yes and this is according to YouTube themselves, and the formula is to Increase watch time and click through rate.\n\nREMINDER:\nInstall this chrome extension to see tips and tricks from top creators on how to get your videos suggested.\n\nHere is is a playlist from YTCreators channel with short videos that explain in detail how Search and Discovery works\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPxnIix5ExI&list=PLpjK416fmKwQK6_REczCaBQ1x1jyHvZAF\n\nWhat Tactics Could I Use To Improve My Chances Of My Videos Being Suggested To More Viewers\nTactics to use to increase traffic for suggested videos include..\n\nAt the end of your videos, make strong calls-to-action to encourage the viewer to watch another video in your series\nYou can do this by using the end screen options which is an option at the end of the upload wizard within the new video up-loader on the YT studio.\nDo not drag out your video ending as it may cause people to stop watching before you can suggest other videos. If you can work out a script for the beginning if your video and for the end of your video to help hook people from the start and take an action at the end of your videos.\n\nThere are some tools that you can use to help promote other videos and these are recommended to \"increase watch time\" which is a factor in making your videos suggested.\nUsing playlists to show videos within a series or within eh same topic that people may like to watch, use links in your video description or the first comment under your video that recommends other videos. \n\nMarketers know that suggested videos can generate twice as many views as appearing in the  search results.\nViewers tend to watch videos in sessions that last around 40 minutes on average, so while watching a video they will have suggested videos that it has data for high click through rate and high watch time.\n\nThe algorithm follows the audience using data that provides a real-time feedback report which is used to choose videos according to the different interests of each viewer.\nThe algorithm aims to suggest the right video for every viewer at the right time. \nIt's work is based on data and for each video, they focus on titles, thumbnails, descriptions, and viewer engagement.\nThey monitor watch time, retention time and whether people click on Like or Dislike in addition to the number of comments.\nThey also look at what each user has seen and not seen in the past, and the time they devote to watching.\nThere are two main goals for the algorithm: \n\n1) Help each viewer find the videos they want to watch \n2) Get viewers to keep watching more of what they like\n\nYou may ask, \"How can I get the algorithm to suggest my channel videos?\" \nThe answer is simple, first get the audience to like your videos.\n\"The ALGORITHM DEPENDS ON AND FOLLOWS THE AUDIENCE\".\nIf people like your channel’s content, the algorithm will suggest it to others.\nWhere will the viewers find these videos? \nThere are \"Six Key Areas where videos are usually found\"\n\n1) THE SEARCH SYSTEM \n\nLet's look at how it works.\nSimilar to Google search engine the YT search aims to display the videos and channels that are most relevant to the content people type in the Search box.\nThe results are not based only on the most viewed videos.\nRather, the videos are categorized according to factors such as how well the title, descriptions, and video itself match the search query.\nThe Algorithm also focuses on videos with the most watch time and the largest percentage of interactions \"FOR EACH SEARCH TERM\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTrLniP5tSQ\n\nSo what can you do to make your videos more discoverable in search results? \n\nYou can do the following: \nUse relevant search terms in titles and descriptions.\nReview Google Trends to find the words people are searching for the most.\nThe important element here is the relevance of the content, do not try to trick viewers as they may stop watching the video early and this may negatively affect its performance in the long run.\nWriting complete descriptions:  (Up to one or two paragraphs at least)\n\nSome content creators just include their social network links in the description but \"THIS IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN THE LOSS OF MANY ADDITIONAL VIEWS\".\nGiving importance to trending topics, especially within your content category\nSo that's about search, but what about the suggested videos? \nLet's talk about how these videos work and what can you do to make your videos easier to discover\n\n2) HOW SUGGESTED (OR RECOMMENDED) VIDEOS  ALGORITHM WORKs.\n\nLet's look at the suggested videos.\nThese videos are based on a user’s previous views, related topics and previous viewing history.\nYou can find these suggestions to the right of the watch page or below the video you watch on the mobile app, and the next video to Auto-play.\nSuggested Videos may be affiliated with any channel, including more from the one that you are watching. So, how can you enhance the visibility of your videos to get your videos suggested to more viewers?\n\nYou can do the following: \nMake a Strong Call To Action\nSuggest another video in your series and really sell then on why (also consider using closed captions too if you can.)\nAvoid long endings, as they may delay the viewers from watching more.\nUse playlists, links, cards and end screens to suggest the next video.\n\nSo that's some info about the suggested videos.\nBut what about the main screen, where to find the home page and what you can do to make it easier for viewers to discover your videos? \n\n3) HOW HOME SCREEN WORKS\n\nIt is the one stop destination for the platform\n\"It's our personalized best guess at what each viewer may want to watch\" In short the home screen is what the algorithm thinks is what each user wants to see.\n\"We show a variety here, and it includes videos that are new, watched by similar viewers or from your subscriptions.\" \n\nKeep in mind that not all videos of your subscriptions appear on the home page, Alternatively, they can all be found on the Subscriptions tab which we will cover in a separate section.\nOn the home page, the choice of videos is based on two things.\nPerformance, or how well a video has engaged and satisfied similar viewers  to date, as well as personalization, which is based on a viewers watch and search history.\nPersonal customization includes how much the viewer watches a channel or a topic, and how many times each video was shown to the viewer.\n\nTo get your videos to show up on the home page, it's helpful to upload new content regularly, keep viewers engaged and continue to provide successful content by sticking to and keep doing what works since the algorithm tries to show more of what your audience likes.\n\n4) HOW THE TRENDING TAB (OR THE POPULAR TAB) WORKS \n\nThe trending feed is a list of videos that are both new and popular and specific to a viewers country.\n\nSome trends are predictable like a movie trailer or a new song from a popular artist, but others can be completely surprising. \nThe trending algorithm aims to combine popularity with novelty, it also considers the view count of a video, especially the rate of growth (velocity) and where the views came from, among other things. That means the video with the highest daily view count may not necessarily be number 1 on trending.\n\nTrending also includes creators and artists on the rise and up and coming writers and artists are featured weekly, for a full day.\n\nThe Creators Academy explains...\n\"There isn't a lot that you can do to get your videos to show up on trending, but it would help if you are making appealing, shareable videos.\nIf you want to make it on the rise, it helps to have a strong channel growth and momentum.\"\n\n5) HOW THE SUBSCRIBERS AND THE SUBSCRIPTIONS TAB WORK\n\nSubscribers are viewers who like your videos enough and want to sign up to watch more of them. \nThey watch videos from all areas and sections of the site and are often considered your biggest fans.\n\nSUBSCRIBERS ALSO PROVIDE THE ‘IMPORTANT INITIAL SIGNALS’ TO THE PERFORMANCE OF A NEW VIDEO. \nThe \"Subscriptions\" tab shows a collection of videos from channels that a viewer has subscribed to. This feed includes a list of the most recent uploads for those channels. \nKeep in mind that subscribers also see subscription content from channels they have subscribed to on the home page screen, and as well as in the suggested videos. \n\nSo how can you get more viewers to subscribe? \nSimply Ask Them To Subscribe!\nLet them know that there will be more videos coming and when, and try to ask them in a genuine way by explaining the benefits and how it is supporting you if they subscribe to the channel.\n\nSUBSCRIBERS ARE YOUR CORE PRIMARY AUDIENCE, but remember, they also often subscribe to lots of other channels. \n\nSo it helps to make your videos public when your viewers are most likely watching. You can take a look at your channel analytics for watch time to see what the best time slot may be by country or region to determine the most appropriate time to upload.\n\n6) HOW  NOTIFICATIONS WORK\n\nNotifications are alerts sent to channel subscribers when a new video becomes public.\nIt can be sent by mobile alerts or via email.\n\nNotifications kick start and drive early traffic, helping with initial visits to your new uploads, but it doesn’t necessarily drive the bulk of view in the long run.\nNotifications can come from the channels you watch a lot, or those you have subscribed to.\n\nIf subscribers want to be notified every time you assign a new video to the public, they can tap the bell icon next to the \"Subscribe\" button.\nThe best way to understand how notifications work is to subscribe to other channels and click on the bell, but make sure notifications are turned on on your phone.\n“We also advise you to teach subscribers how to turn on notifications. Many creators use visuals like creating a video with screenshots of your success.” \n\nWe have discussed many topics in this series Starting with how the algorithm relies on the audience, all six essential areas for video discovery.\nI hope this chrome extension helps you understand how SVO works In order for your videos to be more successful. \nDon't forget to install it, stay on the list for notifications for new marketing, SEO and optimization checklists and of course more tips for  traffic via suggested video will be added to the extension as and when new stuff becomes available."
