Click the extension icon to see the list of papers with summaries and other information. You can click on a paper to see the full details.\n\nOptionally, the extension can also add an icon (ðŸ“Ž) next to the links to research papers. You can click this icon to get the paper summary and other information.\n\nThis works on any website; for example, Google search, Twitter, blogs, tutorials, forums.\n\nHow it works:\n\nThis extension will extract the links to research papers from the websites you visit and send them to labml.ai servers to retrieve papers summaries. We need permission to \"Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit: on all sites\" to do this.\n\nWe have made the source code of this extension public for better transparency (and if anyone in the community wants to help us improve it ðŸ˜Š).\n\nGithub: https://github.com/labmlai/chrome-extension\n\nRestricting access to sites:\n\nIf you go to \"Manage Extensions\"(chrome://extensions/) page on Chrome you will see our extension. Click on details to open the settings. Here, under \"Site Access\", Chrome lets you control what the extension has access to. By default it will be \"On all sites\". You can change this to \"On click\" (where the extension will get access only if you click the extension icon). You can also change this to \"On specific sites\" and add a list of domain names. Here's the documentation by Google (under Let extensions read and change site data): https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769"
