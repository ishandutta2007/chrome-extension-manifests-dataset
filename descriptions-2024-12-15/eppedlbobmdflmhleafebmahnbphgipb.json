The extension also provides an easy way to organize your recent searches, tag favorites, and use AI to summarize the page and answers quickly.\n\nMake searches that aren't possible with regular CTRL + F (or ⌘+F on a Mac). Locus understands your search intent and immediately identifies the relevant sections. Refer back to sections in long papers, PDFs, documents, and articles using natural language instead of remembering keywords.\n\nMix and match documents, searches and summaries in your research!\n\nWhether you're working with long papers, PDFs, documents, articles, news pieces, online textbooks, or blog posts, Locus works seamlessly on most static web pages that contain text.\n\nSave time digesting content on the web and Hack your productivity.\n\nWe're constantly working to make the extension better.
