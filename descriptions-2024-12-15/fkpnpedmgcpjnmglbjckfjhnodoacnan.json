Oftentimes our personal accounts are set as the default account, while we have our school/work account as secondary accounts. When working, it's often annoying to have to continually use Google's UI to switch to your account when going between Gmail, Google Classroom, Google Drive, and other Google services.\n \nG-Switcher allows us to change our default Google account with only 1 click. Simply click the extension icon in your browser bar to cycle between accounts. After cycling through all of your accounts, you can click again to disable the extension, and again to re-enable it and restart on your first account.\n\nThis extension collects NO personal data."
