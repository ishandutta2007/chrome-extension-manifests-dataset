Confirmed beats other schedulers and time management apps hands-down.\n\nWith Confirmed, you’ll reclaim your time from the most time consuming and arduous tasks you do daily and refocus it on the people and activities that make you most successful.\n\n✓ Schedule your time in a few clicks\n✓ On-the-go professionals can save hours of travel weekly\n✓ Make it easier for the other person to accept your meetings by presenting your suggestions in a normal calendar view, and by pre-filling the info on their behalf\n✓ Include multiple people in your meetings and see rosters that include their full names\n✓ Pull info from your Outlook and Google contacts to minimize your own efforts\n✓ Log automatically into Salesforce, Hubspot, Zoho, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and others\n✓ Prioritize your days better and streamline the time wasted going from meeting to meeting\n\nConfirmed takes you way beyond the standard link-based scheduling method by letting you plan your days more strategically, increase the likelihood that others will accept your meetings, and removing arduous tasks that steal time from you every day.\n\nConfirmed was named “Innovator of the Year Start-up Finalist” for the past two years running.\n-------------------------------\nUse this promo code to get a Free 30-day trial to either single user edition (FLOW or Scheduler):  Ext23trial\n\nUse this promo code to get 50% off either single user edition for an entire year (instead of the Free trial): Ext2350off\n\n(These promo codes can be used for annual or monthly subscriptions, but cannot be used together.)\n-------------------------------\nYou can purchase through the Browser Extension by installing it first here.\nOr you can purchase from https://www.ConfirmedApp.com\nHear more customer testimonials at https://www.youtube.com/@confirmedapp\n-------------------------------\nNot yet ready? Here’s more about the benefits of using Confirmed…\n\nA better experience for you and your meeting partners – instead of sending links that do nothing more than reduce email back-&-forth (which is just putting a bandage on a symptom of other problems), use Confirmed’s advanced features, artificial intelligence (AI) / expert systems, and cognitive science based approach to eliminate the causes of the back-&-forth emails, minimize your work and reduce the resistance of the other person to say yes.\n\nStrategic and AI-based travel optimization helps you reduce travel by more effectively scheduling your meetings near one-another and reducing the likelihood that somebody will schedule a meeting that you can’t reach because there is not enough time to travel between meetings.  (This works whether your meetings are around the globe or around the city.)\n\nIf you have used a scheduler that presents the other person with a month view of calendar dates and a list of times, it’s time you upgrade to Confirmed so you can let your desired meeting partner see a true calendar view to select times without making them do extra work for you.\n\nA simple Wizard sign-up sets you up in 10-minutes for success by connecting to your calendar & contacts, setting up the places and platforms you use in your meetings, and letting you select the parameters you want to offer in your meetings. \n\nFor teams of users, Confirmed can be customized and deeply connected to your existing systems; and be used for collaborative activities.  You can even take advantage of an expert team that understands your systems, including Salesforce, Microsoft 365 / Outlook, and others to work with you to identify places that you can get big wins and eliminating your “house-on-fire” problems.  If you don’t have resources to do it, the Confirmed team can help you enhance your current systems as we do that.\n\nYour CIO, CISO and IT Team will love Confirmed because (unlike other products) it meets Fortune 100 security standards, has passed Salesforce.com’s strict security review, and Confirmed’s Enterprise Platform is easy for them to integrate & implement.  They’ll also like the way Confirmed eliminates the need to sync data in many cases, as synchronization often causes duplicate data that is an IT nightmare.\n\nConfirmed is a Salesforce ISV Partner and member of the Microsoft Partner Network.  (Few of our competitors can claim either of these.)\n\nEven Confirmed’s least expensive edition has features beyond Calendly’s highest edition and is priced more favorably than Calendly’s lowest priced option.  No wonder, Confirmed users have said Confirmed “changed my perspective; changed my life” and we have the highest rating of any “similar” app (5-stars).\n\nWhether you’re using Calendly, Doodle, Cirrus Insight, OnceHub, or Time Trade, you’ll find Confirmed to be an upgrade of experience and time improvement for all parties.  And you’ll gain new capabilities that are not part of the other apps.\n\n#reclaimandrefocustime\n#timemanagement\n#schedulemeetings\n#businesstravel\n#calendar\n#appointments"
