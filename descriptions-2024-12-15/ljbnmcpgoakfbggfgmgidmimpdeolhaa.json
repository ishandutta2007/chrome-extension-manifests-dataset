It functions by discovering and tracking the usage of business applications directly from the user's browser. \n\nThis helps companies optimize software spending, ensure compliance, and improve operations by providing insights into application usage and user interaction without compromising personal usage data.\n\nThe extension is primarily focused on mapping business-related SaaS applications, ensuring that personal applications like social media sites are not tracked.\n\nExamples of apps that are mapped: HubSpot, Adobe, ClickUp and all other business software.\nExamples of apps that are not mapped: Facebook, LinkedIn, The New York Times, BBC, and all other personal websites.\n\nThis focus aligns with privacy standards and company policies. Moreover, Vistack.io provides administrators with a detailed view of app usage and discovery, which can be critical for managing licenses and understanding software utilization across the organization."
