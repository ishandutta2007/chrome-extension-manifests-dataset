It also displays the average category rate to understand better and help cross-reference actual data within your industry or sector for competitive analysis.\n \nUnlike other similar tools available on store, using this extension is completely free, and there are no hidden charges, limits or even signup required.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Active Engagement Rate is calculated from the mean average for all interactions and inversely proportional to the number of followers in your account from the last 12 posts or posts published within the previous 28 days, whichever has the minimum count for establishing recency.\n\nAn Average Category Rate is calculated by collating the data of Top 100 accounts in a particular category and by summing their active engagement rate sustained over 90 days. And this includes all the 1550+ Categories of Instagram"
