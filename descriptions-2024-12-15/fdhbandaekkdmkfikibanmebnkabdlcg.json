We use AI to show you summaries and scores for companies based on their legal contracts like terms of service, terms and conditions, privacy policy, and more. Everything is current and updated daily.\n\nYou can use this free browser extension to check any company that owns the website you are browsing! We give you concise yet detailed information about the company so you know what you're getting into. As you browse, the extension icon will change to reflect the company's score in real time. Click the icon to see details about why the website's owner received their score!\n\nThis extension will always be free, ad-free, and will never track anything outside the URL you are currently on (it never remembers URLs outside of your session). We built the extension to be a smart amnesiac who doesn't know how to phone home. We promise that nothing is ever sent back to us from the extension, and we can never know who you are nor what you are doing."
