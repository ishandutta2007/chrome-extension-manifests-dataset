Each highlight is weighted by the count and type of reactions which varies the height of the highlight - the longer the highlight, the greater chance that's the solution you're looking for in the thread.\n\nDownload the extension and just let it simply do its thing while you investigate.\n\nPlease share your feedback! And as always, please rate this extension as you would the most helpful comment!"
