Press [ Alt ‚å• ] + [ T ] or click on the extension button\n  2. Filter the requests you are interested in\n  3. Enable interception, and trigger a new request\n  4. Modify all requests before they are sent to the server\n  5. Modify the responses before they are sent back to the browser\n\n\nNeed Help?\n  There is an FAQ at https://tamper.dev/ and you can visit https://github.com/google/tamperchrome/discussions for asking questions directly to the developers.\n\n\nWant to contribute?\n  Tamper Dev is Free and Open Source Software. Visit https://github.com/google/tamperchrome to learn how you can contribute.\n\n\nAbout Tamper Dev:\n  This is the new version of the extension previously called Tamper Chrome, but now supports multiple browsers, and does not require an auxiliary app. This extension provides functionality similar to Burp Proxy, MITM Proxy, OWASP ZAP, Tamper Data, and Postman Proxy Interceptor, but without the need of additional software, with full support of HTTPS connections, and trivial to set-up (just install)."
