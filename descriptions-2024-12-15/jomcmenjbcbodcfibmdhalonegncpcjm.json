The features it adds to meets are as follows:\n\nA pin message function for the teacher in the chat window. Teachers are able to click a pin option and pin a message in chat to make it show up highlighted in a box. This will make it easier for students to find links, or important messages, in chat.\n\nA banner function to create a bar at the top of students screens that has some text and a link, when students click the bar, they will be taken to the link specified.\n\nA private message function so students can message their friends and not disrupt class, or message the teacher about something private. The teacher can also see all private messages to make sure they are appropriate.\n\nAn away function so students can notify the teacher that they have left due to some cause such as internet problems or using the restroom. This way the teacher can avoid calling on students while they are away.\n\nUPDATES:\n\nv5.0:\n\nAdded features to the extension popup. \nAdded an admin passcode that can be used to access those features.\n\nv4.0:\n\nPrevented you from starting instant meets which could cause Better Meets to be unable to recognize your username.\n\nIf the admin of a meet does not have Better Meets, you will either become the Better Meets admin or will be sent a message stating that the extension is unavailable at the time."
