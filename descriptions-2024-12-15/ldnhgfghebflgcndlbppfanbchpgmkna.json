The definition pops up automatically. Images zooming is another useful feature of the extension.\nSee screenshots for example.\n\nPlease rate if you find it useful. Comment if you have questions, find bugs or have ideas for improvements.\n\nChanges history:\n\nIn version 2.2.0\n - Adjusted to new Wikipedia article structure. Bug fixes.\n\nIn version 2.1.7\n - Fixed image zooming issue.\n\nIn version 2.1.6\n - HTTPS pages support.\n - new extension versioning.\n\nIn version 2.15\n - new setting - hide question marks.\n - minor improvement.\n\nIn version 2.1\n - new feature - image thumbnails inside definition popup.\n - quick little bug fix.\n\nIn version 2.0\n - new feature - hints within another hint popup;\n - settings page simplified;\n - several bugs fixed.\n\nIn version 1.46\n - fixed number of bugs.\n\nIn version 1.45:\n - added new option to enable/disable images zooming.\n\nIn version 1.42:\n - fixed several minor bugs.\n\nIn version 1.4:\n - pressing Esc now closes the image preview popup;\n - get definitions without using a hotkey, just hover the link;\n - notifications about new features;\n\nIn version 1.3:\n - restructuring and code improvements;\n - icons change;\n - some bugs with the hint position;\n\nIn version 1.2:\n - fixed several bugs;\n - added quick pictures zoom option.\n\n\n*** ATTENTION ***\nDue to the changes Wikepedia developers made to the structure of the articles WikipediaQuickHints had a lot of problems with getting correct definition and hence in most cases poped up useless \"Can not get definition for this term ...\" message. Please report the problems so that I could fix problematic places.\n\nThank you for using it! :)"
