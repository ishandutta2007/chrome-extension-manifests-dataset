You will hear the difference with other audio extensions... ;)\n\nHere is the audio tools you will get : \n\n- volume booster / bass booster on any website!\n- 8 audio DJ effects (echo, reverb, flanger...)\n- 3 bands equalizer with a -60dB cut\n- the popular hipass/lowpass DJ filter\n- volume limiter (to avoid distortion)\n- sound launchpad (are you readyyy...)\n- scratch and backspin effects\n- and finally a cool fire effect ;)\n\nTry it by yourself, it is all FREE, NO ADS, because I do this by passion, leave a 5* review to thank me :)\n\nPS : Chrome asks for the permission to \"read\" all your websites because the extension is capturing the audio from any website to process it. All audio extensions (equalizers, volume boosters...) will ask the same permission. No worries :)"
