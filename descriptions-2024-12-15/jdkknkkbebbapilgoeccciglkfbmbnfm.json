This extension has 4 main features:\n\n1. A built-in version of the Apollo Studio Explorer that allows you to make queries against your GraphQL server using your app's network interface directly (no configuration necessary).\n\n2. A query watcher that shows you which queries are being watched by the current page, when those queries are loading, and what variables those queries are using.\n\n3. A mutation inspector that displays the mutations made to your Apollo Client application data.\n\n4. A cache inspector that displays your Apollo Client cache data. You can explore the cache through a tree-like interface, and search for specific field keys and values.\n\nCode for this extension can be found at: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-devtools\n\nAny bugs can be reported by opening a new issue at: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-devtools/issues/new\n\nTo learn more about Apollo, see: https://www.apollographql.com"
