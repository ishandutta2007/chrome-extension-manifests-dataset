The problem is, when you do that you end up having to look at some of the same items multiple times. You already know those products are not what you want, but the store does not.\n\nSearch & Destroy solves this problem by remembering the items you've already seen during your current search, event through search changes or refreshes. \"Seen\" items can be faded out or completely hidden. \n\nBONUS POINTS: with S&D you can also use \"j/k\" keys to navigate through the list of items, and use the \"n\" key to go to next page. This lets you fly through large sets of results with ease.\n\nCurrently S&D is available for:\n* Amazon\n* Etsy\n* Ebay\n* Fiverr\n* ...with more stores coming!\n\nThis extension is open-sourced.
