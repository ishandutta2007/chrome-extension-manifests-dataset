It's best suited for tracking a relatively small number of tasks, so try to group all your activities and end up with 5-10 tasks you want to track daily. Track regularly for a week and then check the stats. You may be surprised to see the distribution!\n\nFeatures:\n - automatically syncs between different machines (in case you sign in to Chrome)\n - access to exactly the same UI from the web in case you use a device like iPad or Android tablet:\n        https://controlfreaktracker.appspot.com/main.html"
