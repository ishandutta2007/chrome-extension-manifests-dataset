Sometimes the email address is not valid and even not exist so the email sent to it will not reach the destination we expected it to reach. Also sending recurring emails lowers the reputation of the email service through which these emails are sent, and false information is obtained in reports on campaign email.\nTherefore, before sending an email and investing resources in an email address, make sure that it exists and that the email will be sent to the person we want him to receive the email.\nAlso sometimes we want to make a call after we have received leads, and you can see what picture is there in his email, which will contribute to creating empathy between seller and buyer. And it will also be possible to see all kinds of other relevant details (is this an admin address, is it a paid email address and more)\nThe use of the extension is part of an entire app on the emailexp.biz website, where you can manually enter an email address and see the  details,\nTo use the extension you must select the email address on any site, no matter what CRM you work with, you do not have to select the exact address enough that the selected text has one email address, if there are several the extension will offer the first, after clicking right click will appear in the option menu Check this email address.\nAfter clicking on the menu, the browser will open a window with the results."
