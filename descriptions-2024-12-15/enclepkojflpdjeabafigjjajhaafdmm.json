We all go through life, but how often do we get to visualize it? \n\nThis extension allows you gain some perspective every time you open a new tab. Enter your age once and see your life in years, months, or weeks; with every dot representing a unit of time. The filled are the ones you've already used, while the rest are yet to be experienced.\n\nOpening a new tab is the perfect instance to get reminded of the limited nature of life, if you deem making each dot as meaningful as possible a worthy goal.\n\nFind it valuable?
