This pipeline detects all the faces in the images, even multiple faces in a single image, and extracts them. The extracted faces are then analysed for gender and ethnicity using another pipeline.\n\nHow accurate is it? The program is still in beta (so we would really value feedback) but the model behind it has an accuracy of 97% which is better than most humans. We're adding ability for users to correct wrong results, and we will use these corrections to continuously improve the model.\n\nWhy this tool? The tool helps ensure transparency and accountability for organisations when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\n\nWhat are the thresholds? The threshold for not being flagged red for Black is 4%, which is based on the percentage of black population in the UK. The threshold for gender is - obviously - 50% women.\n\nWhy only Black? HowDiverse focuses on Black folks due to their consistently low representation, but other ethnicities breakdown is shown on our website https://howdiverse.is.\n\nWhy only binary gender and ethnicity? HowDiverse plans to develop a platform where companies can gather self-identification data beyond binary gender and ethnicity.
