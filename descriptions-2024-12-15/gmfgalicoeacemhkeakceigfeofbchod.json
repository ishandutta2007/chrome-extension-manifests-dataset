Upon installing the extension, you might need to refresh Google Calendar for it to load. \n\nOnce the extension has been installed, you can access the custom color creation by either right clicking events (accessing the color palette), or double clicking the event and accessing the other color palette within the advanced event details page.\n\nYou can verify that the extension has been installed properly by the existence of an additional circle in the color palette with a plus (+) sign. Clicking on this plus sign should prompt you to insert a custom color defined by a hexcode (For example, typing 000000 will give you the color black. One recommended place to find colors is https://htmlcolorcodes.com/). Pressing \"OK\" on the color entry prompt will add this custom color to your color palette for coloring events.\n\nYou can remove custom colors from your color palette by clicking on the extension icon in your browser's extension bar. This will open a small window where clicking on a color will remove it from the extension and your color palette.\n\nNEW FEATURE: The window that was used for removing custom colors now contains a button to toggle between cloud and local mode. Originally, this extension only ran on cloud mode. This allowed your calendar colors to be synced across different computers and browsers. However, it also came with the limitation of max 512 events. Now, with the local mode, this limitation has been increased dramatically. Choose whichever option is better for you! You can toggle between the two as well, and they are managed independently.\n\nFeedback greatly appreciated!\n\nNote:\nThe colors are only available on the web version of Google Calendar.\nThe colors will only be consistent on one browser on a computer unless Google Chrome sync is enabled, in which case the colors will be tied to your Google Chrome profile. \n\nNewest Update (1/7/2023):\nFix a lot of things."
