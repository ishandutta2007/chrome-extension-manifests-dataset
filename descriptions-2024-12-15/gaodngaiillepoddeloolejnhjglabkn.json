This is a slightly misleading description of this permission as your browsing history is not actually used, only the current state of each tab you have open is read to retrieve information such as the page title, URL, etc. No information about your browsing history is read or stored - the only thing that is stored is your choice of list view (compact or expanded). Read more about this permission here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#type-Tab.\n\nFeedback can be emailed to chris@nanimokamo.com."
