This allows you to keep scalpers' items out of your search and browse results. You control the seller list, and can add and remove sellers as you want.\n\n** Version 1.1.1 is out, which should fix the page change issue. **\n\n- Item listings for sellers in your block list are removed from your view - either removed entirely, or replaced with a scolding message. \n- For direct links (single item and seller pages), sellers will have their names marked in red and an indication that they are on your block list.\n- Block list is case insensitive.\n- Can block sellers on all Circlly sales sites."
