At the moment it supports 102 online judges, including most major ones like AtCoder and Codeforces.\n\nUsing it is very simple. Just install the extension, make sure you got one of the supported tools open, navigate to a problem page and click on the green plus icon in the top-left of your browser. On websites where Competitive Companion is able to parse contests, navigating to the page with all the problems and clicking on the green plus icon will download and parse all problems in the contest at once. You can also use the Ctrl+Shift+U shortcut instead of the green plus icon (configurable on chrome://extensions/shortcuts)."
