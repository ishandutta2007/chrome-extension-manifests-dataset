Trump\"!\n\n11/2020 Note: Since Flickr deleted all the photos for this extension this year the ability to pick the tags/photos you want to use is currently not working - so for now you'll see a random/rotation of all images in the collection. I will remove this message if/when I find a way to get this working again. My apologies!\n\nPlease leave a review with your thoughts, ideas, etc.\n\n------------------------\nVersion History \n------------------------\n\n20230503110656\n------------------------\n* Some technical issue (btw sorry some of the photo filters don't seem to work fully atm)\n\n20210214063542 \n------------------------\n* Added 70 or so images from the last few months of his epic first term. God bless and long live the king. \n* My apologies but the categories stuff still isn't working (due to Flickr deletions) - I'll fix if/when I get time/inspiration.\n* NOTE: I've noticed there are some quirks now w/this working in some cases for DuckDuckGo.com - so this extension may only be working for Chrome's \"new tab\" or google.com right now - I'll fix if/when I can as soon. \n\n\n1.2.000 Update \n------------------------\nPushed all ~800+ of the images to new image host (after Flickr deleted everything). Seems to be working - will keep an eye on it. LMK if anyone has any issues.\n\n1.1.003 Update\n------------------------\nSadly fist repair attempt failed (Google photos). Trying imgur now.\n\n1.1.001 Update\n------------------------\nI regret to inform everyone that Flickr deleted all the photos for this extension ... all 600+ of them! They didn't give me a reason or any kind of warning. I am reaching out to inquire more details but it is very likely I won't be able to get them back. I have thrown a few images into another spot for now just so this extension shows some images (instead of nothing which it's been doing for a few weeks now thanks to Flickr). My apologies on the inconvenience. Once I feel like I've found a stable photo storage location I'll attempt to rebuild this extensions photo library - but it took me quite a while to get the over 600 photos originally so will take some time :(.\n\n\n1.0.063 Update\n------------------------\n~80 new photos added! Screenshot: https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50383144708_1146ccd3ea_o.png\n\n1.0.062 Update\n------------------------\nI noticed Google was sometimes sneaking in artwork and other stuff at Google \"Meet\" (meet.google.com) so I made a quick/minor update to the extension to replace that with a photo of President Trump instead. \nScreenshot: https://bit.ly/31HErvk \n\n1.0.061 Update\n------------------------\n~70 new photos added from mid-2019 to first half of 2020. Now ~740 total photos in the rotation!\n\n1.0.060 Update\n------------------------\nHandful of new photos added to the rotation (North Korea, July 4th, etc).\n\n20181125083911\n------------------------\nHandful of new photos added. ~585 now!\n\n20180914082520\n------------------------\n* 70 more photos added! (total ~560 now!)\n* Version number/build added to options screen\n* Few script adjustments\n\n\n20180704055853\n------------------------\nRefreshing for updated photos/photo count\n\n\n20180626052853\n------------------------\nHandful of new photos added to rotation / photo count increased\n\n20180428171527\n------------------------\n- Added bunch more photos. Refreshing version number.\n\n\n20180428171527\n------------------------\n- New Full Size Background Image FX added\n- Image FX settings real-time preview added\n- MANY more photo category tags added!\n- Tag logic adjusted for (hopefully) better accuracy\n- Extension settings saved to Chrome sync now\n- More photos added (in progress)\n- Various bug fixes\n\n\n20180423200159\n------------------------\nTrying out some image effects options to the extension menu.\n* Sepia Tone\n* Grayscale\n* Faded Edges\n* Semi-Opaque\n\n\n20180421175257\n------------------------\nNew menu buttons added to the image area! Now you can view a larger image, go to the next image or download the original image with the click of a button! See the \"New Menu Buttons\" screenshot for a visual.\n\n\n20180419211327\n------------------------\nThe extension now has a fun new feature where you can specify which kinds of photos are rotated! The starting categories are: \n\n- Funny\n- Artwork\n- Melania\n- White House\n- Foreign Affairs\n- Military\n- Closeup\n\nEnjoy! PS: Feel free to suggest other categories.\n\n\n201804188223250\n------------------------\n* More work on \"New Tab\" quirks\n* Photo tag/settings coming soon!\n\n\n201804178222230\n------------------------\n* New tab quirk fix(es)\n\n\n201804178212229\n------------------------\n* Some work getting \"new tab\" to work properly\n* Prepping for photo tag settings (soon!)\n\n\n20180416175400\n------------------------\n* Clicking image will now download largest version.\n* New photos added\n\n\n20180415150950:\n------------------------\n(Hopefully) fixed bug where not working in new tab."
