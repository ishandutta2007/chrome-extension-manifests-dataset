YouTube™ and HBO Max and others have this built-in already.\n\nSupported Websites:\n✔ Hulu\n✔ Vimeo\n✔ Dailymotion\n✔ and many more\n\nYou can also set a keyboard shortcut to manually hide the cursor (hovering over video or fullscreen not required).\n\nContact me if there's a specific website you'd like me to add specific timeout settings for.  By default the idle time is set to 2 seconds after the last mouse movement.  YouTube, for example, has a 4 second idle time so that the mouse hides when for the player interface gets hidden too.\n\n⚠️ Troubleshooting and Notes:\n▸ It appears that Chrome extensions that hide the mouse cursor require the mouse to be moved after the pages loads.  I haven't found a way around this.\n▸ Some website video players resist cursor hiding.  I found a work-around for fullscreen videos but I'm not aware of a solution when videos are not fullscreen.\n\nWant to zoom, rotate, stretch or flip video?  \nCheck out another extension of mine, Video Transformer:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cafdfogfbjpgdmppmdchgcggdepfbndo\n\nChangelog:\n1.0.1 (2022-09-09):\n▸ possible bugfix for manual shortcut\n▸ improved icon size for extension page\n\n1.0:\n▸ first version!"
