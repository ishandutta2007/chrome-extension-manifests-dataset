Part of the extension which previously did not need user permission to operate now does - Chrome may prompt you to re-authorise access for the extension to work. The new permission allows the extension to see all the tab url's you have open - this is used to keep your watched video history up to date between multiple Youtube tabs.\n\n1.18\n\nAdded option to bypass the \"Mark all videos as watched\" alert\nA few bug fixes\n\n1.17 \n\nAdded settings panel with link to Twitter & Github. \nAdded a setting to auto load videos as you scroll\nGreatly increased the number of videos the extension will track in it's history from 200 to 5000.\nNumerous bug fixes & performance enhancements.\n\n1.15 & 1.16\n\nClassic grid mode is here! Provides a third grid view along side YT's two views, which emulates the traditional \"classic\" grid. No date headers, and a wider viewing area. Also fixed a number of bugs and added some performance improvements. \n\n\n*** PLEASE NOTE: If you are missing videos, channel names, titles etc this is very likely because Youtube are using you to test new page code, which I don't have access to. There is very little I can do until Youtube make this the default, please submit a bug here: https://github.com/CodeNinjaUK/youtube-subs-grid/issues ***"
