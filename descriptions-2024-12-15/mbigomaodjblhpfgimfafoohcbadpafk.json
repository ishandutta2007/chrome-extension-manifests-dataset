It's just the same mechanics, with the same engines over and over again. I wish there was a game that broke the mold for this stagnant genre... And so we get to BTR 80... This game is an all out, pedal to the metal, tank fueled destruction derby! Relieve your daily stress with this brilliant game in which you get to take a massive tank for a spin over some pretty cool obstacles. This game is perfect for anybody who loves tanks, and let's be honest for a moment, everybody loves tanks! And the BTR 80 is the king of all tanks!"
