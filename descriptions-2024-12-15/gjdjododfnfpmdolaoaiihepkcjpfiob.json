It also ensures that activity logs created by the Truly application are associated with the right contacts and objects in supported third party websites like CRMs (Salesforce, Zendesk), Sales Engagement Providers (Salesloft, Outreach, Apollo) and Email providers (Gmail).\n\nRequirements: \nThis extension requires a companion desktop app which can be downloaded at https://truly.co.  You will not be able to start calls or send text messages without the companion app.\nThe extension/companion app is intended for use by current customers of Truly only.  Please sign up for an account before installing this extension"
