As per the doctors if they don't drink water, don't walk, don't do eye rest etc at regular interval of time then this could lead to life long health issues such as hard stools and constipation, sore legs, eyestrain & back pain.\n\nTo solve this problem we have added some important health care activities which comes as full screen prompt to notify activity break.\n\nThere are certain key features in this extension:\n\n1. The activity break notification will come as a full screen with break countdown.\n\n2. The time interval or countdown will stop when the user is in idle state.\n\n3. No notification will appear during non-working hours which are usually after 6pm & saturday - sunday whole day.\n\n4. All the settings are configurable, such as, you can set your own time interval, time length of break, title & description of break & theming."
