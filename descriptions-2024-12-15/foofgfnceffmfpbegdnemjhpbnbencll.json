That’s why we created Etisalat Wider Web to simplify the way some experience the web. The web extension is the first of its kind and curates the user experience to people who are on the autistic spectrum. \n\nEtisalat Wider Web adopts a wide range of technologies in order to streamline the experience of autistic people on the web: \n\nCleared up interface \n\nOption to choose a sans serif font \n\nThree color schemes: dark, medium and light grey \n\nAdvertising removal \n\nBlocking of video’s auto play \n\nAudio volume reduction \n\nThe extension is available on almost every website and in every language. It’s currently optimized for the most visited UAE websites. \n\nPlease note that the extension isn’t adaptable to some blacklisted websites. Please get in touch with these sites’ developers to ask for adaptability. \n\nAll feedback is welcome and encouraged through the report button on the extension interface. \n\nWe are also very proud to say that the extension, although developed by Etisalat, is an open source technology and we invite anyone to contribute to its constant improvement and wider adoption.\n\n*According to autism experts in the UAE."
