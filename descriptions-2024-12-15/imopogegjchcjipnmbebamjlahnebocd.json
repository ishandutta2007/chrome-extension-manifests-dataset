Attest allows you to generate advanced mathematical proofs called zero-knowledge proofs. Those proofs can be used to privately and verifiably demonstrate that users have certain characteristics — like how many followers users have on a certain social media application — in a secure way. Application developers can verify these proofs and incorporate these characteristics into their own application’s flows. Your private data stays completely within your control — Attest does the rest."
