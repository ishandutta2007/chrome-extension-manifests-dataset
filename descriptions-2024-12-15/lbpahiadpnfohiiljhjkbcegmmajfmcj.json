For this reason, this extension facilitates practicing different sections of a video according to a set of defined loops. There are sites, apps, and extensions that allow the user to loop a portion of a YouTube video, or repeat nonstop. The advantage of this extension is that it allows the user to stay within the YouTube site and loop multiple portions of a video automatically. This allows the user to focus on practicing their instrument at various speeds without having to manually restart the video at specific points.\n\nYoung Guitar Magazine inspired the development and naming of this extension. They provide demonstration videos with breakdowns of solos and phrases at various speeds. Each exercise begins with an Ex-# label."
