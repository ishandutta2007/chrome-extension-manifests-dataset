It allows users to create a list of sensitive information, such as real names or locations, that they wish to keep private during their live streams or video recordings. MaskMe then automatically replaces these sensitive words with user-defined substitutes across the web pages being displayed, minimizing the risk of accidental exposure of private information. With its real-time text replacement and intuitive interface, MaskMe is a must-have tool for anyone seeking to maintain their privacy while engaging with their audience online."
