On clicking the icon you get a popup window with a simple list from which you can open, delete or otherwise manage your bookmarks.\n\nCombined with the automatic synchronization provided by Chrome, this is a powerful tool to keep track of articles/news you want to read later. Just add them from your mobile, and it appears almost instantly on your laptop/computer.\n\nChanges:\n1.1.3:\n- Larger font for the links\n- Bigger, more visible action buttons\n\n1.1.2:\n- Further visual improvements\n- More logical placing for the manage button\n\n1.1.1:\n- Further visual improvements\n\n1.1.0:\n- Actions added to manage and delete bookmarks\n\n1.0.9:\n- Updated visuals\n- Fixed Disable/Enable behaviour\n\n1.0.8:\n- Updated visuals\n\n1.0.7:\n- Synchronized storage for the folder name and location\n- Options to change folder name and location\n\n1.0.6:\n- Fixed empty popup\n- Changed style for popup window\n\n1.0.4: \n- Popup page shows the current links\n\n1.0.3: \n- The extension creates the Read Later folder if missing\n- Context menus to add the page/link to read later\n- Refresh button on the options page to re-initialize the extension"
