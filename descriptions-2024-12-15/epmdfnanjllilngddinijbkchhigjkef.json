So say your competitor has a link on a page, you know what their domain name is, but you don't know what the anchor text is. This extension let's you input the domain into the search box and it will scroll to the anchor/hypertext for the link, so you don't need to do things like look a the source code to find the what the anchor text/hypertext is that relates to the link. I tend to use this with backlink checkers. It allows you to see a competitor's link \"in situ\", so to speak. But you can look at many pages if you use something like \"Bulk URL Opener\", another Chrome Extension."
