A great challenge for smart people!\n\nPlay more games on the left-bar menu\n\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\n- Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nWith 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks."
