But you always have the option to open via the extension popup or the sidebar if you're on a google doc page.\n\nWhat It Does:\nITDs (Important Technical Decisions) are technical documentation that is written to justify key technical decisions being made in the lifecycle of a software project. These decisions help communicate to other stakeholders about the options that were considered to solve a problem and the rationale behind selecting a specific option. This extension provides assistance using AI capabilities to help improve the quality of the ITDs written across the organization through various checks that are run against a submitted text."
