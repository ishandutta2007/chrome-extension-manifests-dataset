He becomes she, Feminism becomes men's right activism, king becomes queen etc. \n\nIt works great even with most slang, including some pick-up-artist lingo. As opposed to similar browser extensions, GenderSwapper will attempt to preserve the original text and grammar. While it's not perfect (for example it can be hard to figure out for an algorithm whether \"cock\" refers to an animal or human anatomy in a vulgar manner) you'll be surprised how well it works!\n\nAdditionally there are a bunch of settings and alternative wordlists.\n\nIt's absolutely fantastic to highlight double standards and hypocrisy on tabloids and internet comments alike."
