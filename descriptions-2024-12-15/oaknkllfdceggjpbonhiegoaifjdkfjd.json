Inside old Word applications Clippy was not so useful but he always had great comment or two. This extension will provide clippy inside every website you visit. For some website Clippy will make a random comment based on the public repository file. Checkout extension website on info how to contribute!\n\nThe default assistant Clippy has been heavily mocked in popular culture, being parodied, appearing in memes, and even being made fun of by Microsoft themselves from 2001 onwards. NOW HE IS BACK ONCE MORE INSIDE YOUR BROWSER!\n\nClippy is back with little help of clippy.js (Smore Inc)"
