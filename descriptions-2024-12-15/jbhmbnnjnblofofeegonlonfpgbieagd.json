Using the power of sentiment analysis and machine learning, Mindful lets users see the sentiment value of what they type online in real time – through emojis. It also provides advanced analysis to determine if text is toxic, sexually explicit, obscene and much more.\n\nThe internet has become a wonderful place to spread ideas and beliefs, and no one should be scared to share them online. The purpose of this extension is to make you more “mindful” of the things you say online, so more people can feel free to express themselves.\n\nIf you do not want the extension to work on certain webpages, you can blacklist them by clicking on the icon in the right-hand corner of the browser and untick the checkbox.\n\nPlease feel free to provide feedback. We want to continuously improve this extension, and we need your feedback to do so. Please submit all issues, suggestions and feedback to http://mindful-extension-feedback.herokuapp.com.\n\nThis extension is also open source under the AGPL-3.0-only License. For developers who want to contribute, please go to https://github.com/MitchellMarkGeorge/Mindful to start development.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact the developer at mitchellmmarkgeorge@gmail.com.\n\nThank you for using this extension and let's make the internet a safer place!"
