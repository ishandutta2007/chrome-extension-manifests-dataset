No more annoying logouts after just a few minutes. Simply click the extension icon in the top right of your browser, slide the toggle, and your session is now good to go for 3 hours! This works by sending a request to Case Search in the background every minute with your session cookie or by grabbing a new one if needed. \n\nThis extension is not an excuse for bypassing the Maryland Judiciary Case Search terms of use. So make sure you agree with them BEFORE you use this extension. http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/. \n\nThis extension does not track you case search data.\n\nThis extension was created independently by Matthew Stubenberg. It is not sponsored by the State of Maryland or the Maryland Courts."
