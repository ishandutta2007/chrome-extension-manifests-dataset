Migrated from Chrome Manifest V2 to V3, due to the new  V3 \"storage\" api, your old settings may need to be reentered. \n\nYou can override:\nRequest Headers: Origin\nResponse Headers: Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Access-Control-Allow-Credentials, Access-Control-Expose-Headers\n\nGuide on CORS: \nhttps://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/cors/Authoritative-Guide-to-CORS-Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing-for-REST-APIs/\n\nAPI Logging & Capture:\n\nYou can capture any Ajax, XmlHttpRequest, or fetch API requests made by any page, and send to your Moesif account for analytics and debugging. \n\nDISCLAIMER: This tool circumvents CORS security rules baked into every browser and is intended for testing your own website during development. Some production websites like Google Docs or Facebook may complain if they detect something that isn't expected. You can use the whitelist feature to only turn on for some domains. To avoid security issues, it is recommend to turn off after debugging. \n\nAbout Moesif API Monetization and Observability: \n\nMoesif (https://www.moesif.com) enables API teams at UPS, You.com, Deloitte, and others to deeply understand customer API usage and ship better API products with user-centric API analytics and monetization, which enables you to:\n    - Understand customer API usage with user behavior analytics.\n    - Debug issues quickly with high-cardinality API logs and metrics.\n    - Get alerted of problems that impact customers.\n    - Track API KPIs with custom dashboards.\n    - Meter API usage and set up billing meters with integrations with Stripe, Chargebee, and custom billing platforms. \n\nBy using this extension, you agree to Moesif's terms of use (https://www.moesif.com/terms) and privacy policy (https://www.moesif.com/pravicy)."
