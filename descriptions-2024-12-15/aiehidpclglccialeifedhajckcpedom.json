This extension basically does the same thing without the hassle.\n\nWhen detecting outgoing HTTP requests from your Chrome browser to the VHost Domain we redirect to the VHost IP. When detecting outgoing HTTP requests from your Chrome browser to the VHost IP, the extension simply adds a Host header containing the domain name specified in the VHost Domain. Any requests to sites other than the VHost Domain and VHost IP are ignored, so browsing other sites won't be impacted.\n\n== HOW TO USE ==\n\n- Enable -\nClick the VHost icon in the top right and enter the desired domain name.\nWhen a domain is present and [x] Enabled is checked, the VHost icon turns red. That means all websites will be requested with the entered domain.\n\n- Disable -\nUntick the [ ] Enabled checkbox. The icon will turn green-ish which means VHost is disabled and all websites will be requested with the regular host name.\n\n== Source ==\nI released the source code on GitHub: https://github.com/Gachl/Virtual-Hosts-Chrome-Extension\nI was unable to improve this extension with more features and I saw it being used by quite a lot of people. So thank you for that! If you need any features you can find the code or a fork of someone who already implemented more stuff over on GitHub.\n\n== THANK YOU ==\nFor using this extension. If you have the time to spare, please consider rating it in the Web Store.\n\nMany thanks to mcarver (https://github.com/mcarver) for:\n- Cleaning my very basic JS\n- Adding request filtering\n- Adding redirect\n- Adding Chrome storage sync\n- Making this thing better in many ways\n\nFor the next version I hope to merge Zacqarys changes (https://github.com/Zacqary/Virtual-Hosts-Chrome-Extension) to this version."
