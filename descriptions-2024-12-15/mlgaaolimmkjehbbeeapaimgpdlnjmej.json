In any of the popular website filtering or parental control tool, a web page is entirely blocked, or allowed to show all contents. Only domain, url or ip based restrictions may be applied. Some of these technologies analyze the content of the website, but eventually block the entire page in case a harmful content is found. They are not capable of locate the harmful content only and block only that part. \n\nIt's clear that the old technology will not work on many websites today, especially on large platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc... These platforms would either be blocked entirely, which will limit the user ability to connect to them, or would be allowed limitless. Displaying all type of contents provided by these platforms may be harmful to any user, but especially young adults and children. Within a few clicks, the users may end up on an unintended page on these platform that may serve explicit (sex, violence, abuse, suicide) content, or gun-related, drug-related contents that may be harmful to users. \n\nThe need for today's platforms has been changed, and that's why we have developed a new technology that we call 'Selective Content Filtering' to address these issues. Our new 'Selective Content Filtering' technology identifies text and images within a web page, and blocks only that content, without blocking the whole website. This way, the other contents which are not harmful can be consumed without any risk. With this technology, the end-users will not even notify that a content-filtering or parental control application is actually running behind the scenes and blocking malicious/harmful content."
