So you can easily see, if you have a broken VPN or proxy connection when the country-code changes unexpectedly. Additionally a notification appears on your desktop when one of your IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) has changed - of course, it can be turned off in settings.\n\nYou can also display your position on a map by clicking the corresponding button next to the IP address.\n\nYour user agent is shown in the entries as well.\n\nPlease feel free to contribute at GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/AykutCevik/Geolocate-IP-Browser-Extension\n\nThe request to the server to obtain your geolocational information is secured at least with TLSv1. Also Perfect Forward Secrecy is enabled."
