The goal is to not drop the egg while driving on bumpy roads. With this extension you can play Eggy Car anytime you want, right in your browser.\n\nIt’s easy to learn but gets harder as you go. You’ll need to drive carefully to keep the egg balanced while going up and down hills. The car moves smoothly and you can control the speed with a tap. The challenge is to keep the egg safe even when the road gets crazy.\n\nIf the egg drops the game is over and you have to start again.\n\nPress the left/right arrow keys to go backward or forward.\n\nThe extension is small and easy to install. Once installed you can play with a single click. The game loads fast and no complicated settings or menus to worry about."
