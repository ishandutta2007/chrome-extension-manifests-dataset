Please contact us at the email below for more information if interested. Thanks! ***\n\nThis extension allows Cherry Creek School District students to calculate the percentage of their grades in powerschool. There is also additional functionality that supports classes that have weighted grades (by selecting the check box \"Weighted by category.\" Students are also able to adjust \"Earned Points\" value and \"Total Points\" value locally for purposes such as seeing what it would take to raise one's grade. Other features coming soon...\n\nEmail sgupta17@kentdenver.org with any questions, concerns or ideas for future versions.
