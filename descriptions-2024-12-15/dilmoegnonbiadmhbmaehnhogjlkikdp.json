Easy-to-use. Toggle switch for quick disabling of all Shorts from Youtube recommendations. \nInstallation: press the 'Add to Chrome' button. \nHow to use: It will activate automatically upon installation. To re-enable shorts, or remove the extension, click on the Extensions (on top right corner) > Manage Extensions.\n\nThere are other similar extensions on the store; this extension is minimalistic and comes with no other features, which makes it a safer choice from potential security concerns. \n\nHave any questions or feature request? Send email: nyakoraiden@gmail.com\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: How do I install the extension?\nA: You can install the extension directly from the Chrome Web Store by clicking on the \"Add to Chrome\" button. Once installed, it will automatically run on any YouTube page you visit, removing Shorts sections as you browse.\n\nQ: Is the extension free?\nA: Yes, the extension is completely free to use.\n\nQ: Will the extension block all types of video suggestions?\nA: No, the extension only targets YouTube Shorts. All other video suggestions, including long-form videos and recommended content, will still appear as usual on your homepage and sidebar.\n\nQ: Does it work on mobile?\nA: Short answer: No. Long answer: Unfortunately, iOS is a highly controlled environment, and it doesn’t allow third-party apps to modify or alter the functionality of other apps. Android is more flexible than iOS, but it still doesn’t officially allow third-party apps to modify or change the behavior of other apps like YouTube. To make modifications at the app level, users would need root access, which, again, isn't recommended for the average user. If you are still interested, look into a mobile browser with an ad/content blocker or alternative clients like NewPipe (for Android).\n\nQ: Does this extension collect my personal data?\nA: Absolutely not! This extension does not track or collect any of your personal data. It only modifies the appearance of YouTube pages on your browser to hide Shorts content.\n\nQ: Will this extension work with other browsers like Firefox or Edge?\nA: The extension is primarily designed for Google Chrome. However, it may work with Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge and others. To install it in other browsers, you would need to follow their specific instructions for adding Chrome extensions.\n\nQ: Can I re-enable YouTube Shorts after installing the extension?\nA: Yes, if you decide that you want to see YouTube Shorts again, you can easily disable or remove the extension from your browser by going to the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/) and turning it off or uninstalling it."
