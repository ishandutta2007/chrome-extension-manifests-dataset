In \"Existing\" mode, it will evaluate the Content Security Policies on the sites that you visit\n2. In \"Suggest\" mode, it will add replace any existing CSP header with a Report-Only header designed to send reports to a service that you run locally. This service will provide you with a CSP that will cover all the reported violations. This mode makes it easy to generate a starter CSP for a website that has never had one before.\n3. In \"Override\" mode, you can specify a CSP that will add a CSP to a site that has none, or replace the one that is there. This mode is designed for testing and tweaking your CSP before you actually deploy it to your site."
