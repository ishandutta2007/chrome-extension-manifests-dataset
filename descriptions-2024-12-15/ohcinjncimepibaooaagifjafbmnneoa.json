This is similar, but you can include a note with the link!\n- End to End encryption - all transferred data are encrypted thanks to Chrome Sync\n- No need to create additional account - Chrome Sync will handle everything\n- Inbox - history of last 100 received notes\n- Outbox - history of last 100 send notes\n- No Ads!\n\nüõë Limitations of Chrome Sync engine:\n- Chrome Sync can handle only 100KB of data - if you try to send VERY long note or many long notes to many devices, it may run out of space and fail. However, when device receives a note, it's removed from Chrome Sync to free up space.\n- No instant messages - sending messages may take some time (it depends on Chrome Sync, usually it takes few seconds)\n- Synchronization conflicts - message can get lost if devices are not synchronized in time.
