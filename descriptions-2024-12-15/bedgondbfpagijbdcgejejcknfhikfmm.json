[name] will help.\n\nHow [name] helps you have more privacy in Chrome:\n\n1. CHOOSE THE LEVEL OF ONLINE PRIVACY YOU WANT\n\nChanging your Chrome settings is the first step to having more privacy in Chrome. But doing it is a pain, so most people don't.\n\nInstead, we’ve arranged the key Chrome settings which impact your privacy, things like cookies, location, passwords and notifications, into three simple privacy levels, Low, Medium and High.\n\nChoose the level you want and [name] will apply those Chrome settings for you, saving you the hassle, and a lot of clicks!\n\n2. CLEAR YOUR CHROME HISTORY FOR MORE PRIVACY\n\nClearing your Chrome history regularly is a simple but effective way to increase your privacy in Chrome.\n\nFrom your browsing history, to cache, to cookies, different types of files stored on your computer can be accessed by web trackers to collect information about you. Deleting these regularly helps prevent that, but is something many people don't do.\n\n[name] makes it easy for you to keep track of how many records you have and to clear your Chrome history more regularly.\n\n3. PRIVACY DOESN'T STOP THERE AND WE'RE HERE TO HELP\n\nUnfortunately, protecting your privacy in Chrome doesn’t stop there. Hackers and the AdTech industry are constantly finding ways to collect your information for their benefit.\n\nBut, we’re busy working against that, to help make your browsing in Chrome more private. Stay tuned for their release!\n\nCONTACT US\n\nWe'd love to hear from you.\n\nGet in touch with any questions or feedback at nameinsquarebrackets@gmail.com or leave a rating in the ratings section."
