It works parallel to YouTube's own commenting system without interfering with each other.\nDifference between VOICE2EARN (V2E) & YouTube Commenting System:\n1. Using V2E, anyone can start a free discussion forum for any video, even if the video is not yours.\n2. Every commenting action made under V2E is recorded and permanently saved on the blockchain. Even if a comment is deleted by the forum's current manager, the comment still can be viewed but only with a different mark, maximizing the spirit of freedom of speech.\n3. Under V2E, the right of forum management can be traded or transferred among V2E users.\nHence, VOICE2EARN is also a TRADING PLACE for its own commenting forums. For a video, the higher the number of views, the higher the value of the forum. The management right can be traded for a range of VT tokens calculated based on the number of views. Even if no one takes the offer, after 7 days of the offer being made, the V2E system will automatically reclaim the management right and compensate the offeror based on the current number of views. Remember, the views for any given video usually have nowhere to go but up!\nFor more detail, please see:\nwww.voice2earn.com\nLet your voice have value with VOICE2EARN!"
