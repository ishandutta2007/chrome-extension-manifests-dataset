It will warn you if you’re likely to feel video call fatigue during the day and week. The tool can only see how many meetings you have, how long they are, if there’s a video meeting link included, and if you’re attending. It can’t see the agenda, who is invited, or any other information.\n\nBy installing, using, or otherwise accessing this extension, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
