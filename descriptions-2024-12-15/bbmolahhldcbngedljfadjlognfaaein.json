Just install and pin the extension. Next, visit your Applet-based website, click the extension icon in the upper-right corner of your browser, and then press the 'Enable' button in the popup. Once enabled, the extension is activated for the current domain, and Applets will start automatically if they are present.\n\nThis extension works by 'converting' the Java Applet to WebAssembly and JavaScript on the fly. It is private and secure, runs fully client-side (i.e. it does not contact any server), and does not collect any data or analytics at all. All your data, as well as your application are kept within the boundaries of your browser.\n\nThis extension, developed by Leaning Technologies, is based on CheerpJ, a JVM/JRE replacement for modern browsers. More information on CheerpJ are available at https://www.cheerpj.com.\n\nThis software is free to use for non-business purposes on public-network Applets. For any other use, such as internal network applets, or if you are a company or public-sector organisation and would like to license CheerpJ, please get in touch with sales@leaningtech.com."
