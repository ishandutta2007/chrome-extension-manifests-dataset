Use the Four Letter Filter to mask unwanted bad words from popular social media like Facebook and Twitter, and filter foul language from any web site or web search result.\n\nThe Four Letter Filter removes over 425 bad words and word derivations found on the web. It will attempt filtering static content (plain old web page), dynamic content (like social media sites), and pages within pages (aka, iframes). You can even add custom bad words to filter!\n\nWorks with both Windows and Mac Chrome users!\n\nThere are several categories of bad words that can be filtered:\n* Really bad words will always be filtered. These should need no explanation.\n* (Optional) Possibly offensive words which are generally biological or common household words that can be used within the context of a bad word or insult.\n* (Optional) Biblical words that can be contextually misused.\n\nYou can also add your own custom words that you deem to be offensive or insulting!\n\nNote: This filter will mask bad words in a web page, but will not mask bad words found in an image, video, pdf, or other applications."
