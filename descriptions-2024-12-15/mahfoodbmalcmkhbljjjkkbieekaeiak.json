The page title was an option, but it doesn't update when you navigate to a previously generated prompt. So the prompt input field is the best we can do.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe problem\n\nDALL·E 2 is an incredible achievement. It displays creativity never before seen in a ML system. But the UI only lets you view the 50 most recent prompts and generated image sets. Anything more than 50 tasks ago is lost. Currently if you want to save the images you've generated you have to download each image one by one. And if you want to remember which prompt generated these images you have to make a note of that yourself, and how to link which prompts generated which images becomes a tedious exercise in manual organisation and file renaming.\n\nThe solution\n\nThis extension creates a button in the bottom left hand corner of the page that, when clicked, downloads all the current prompt's images in a zip folder, whose filename is the prompt that generated them. You can now save your prompt and its generated images in a single click."
