Say goodbye to the tedious manual entry of each stat and the long 20-minute team sheet fill-outs. With our extension, you can efficiently submit your team in just about 40 seconds! Enjoy the added convenience of importing your team directly from Pokémon Showdown. Elevate your team-building experience today!\n\nIn addition to speeding up the team submission on RK9 Labs, we have also added a highly requested change: Pictures for all Pokémon to help distinguish any form change! No more generic Scarlet and Violet logo for new Pokémon!\n\nNote: Extreme Speed - VGC Companion is not affiliated with RK9Labs, Nintendo, Game Freak, Pokémon Showdown or The Pokémon Company International. Please always make sure that the team submitted here matches the team in your console, and that your Pokémon are appropriately leveled prior to importing your team for accurate results.\n\nCredit to @Yugib0y on Twitter for the logo!\n\nPatch Notes:\n\nBug fix:\n- Added Terapagos and Tera Starstorm\n- Added missing moves and abilities for restricted pokemon introduced in Regulation G\n- Fixed rounding error for Effort Values (Thank you Jorjin (@JoriVGC) for bringing up this issue)"
