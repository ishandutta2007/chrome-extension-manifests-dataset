By combining both AI detection and an audit report of document revisions, Passed.AI is the only tool that provides an enforceable level of detection.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\nPassed.AI works with any Google Doc to which a teacher has Edit access. Our Chrome extension shows the probability that a document was generated by AI, along with a Document History Audit that lets teachers “watch” a student write the text.\n\n1. Student Submits Work as a Google Document\nPassed.AI requires work to be submitted in Google Document format with edit access. No additional software is required for the student. \n\n2. Passed.AI Analyzes the Document\nTeachers click on the Passed.AI button within the Google Document. Passed.AI then analyzes the text and creates a detailed Human vs AI report.\n\n3. Receive Audit Report and “Watch” Student Write\nReceive an AI probability score. Plus, teachers are able to watch as the document is created based on the revision history. The final report provides an enforceable level of certainty on the true source of the text.\n\nAI Trained to Recognize AI Generated Text\nPassed.AI uses leading AI models trained on all popular NLP models to predict if written text was AI or student created. Receive a probability that the work was student or AI created.\n\n98%+ accurate on ChatGPT created text\n\nTrained on GPT-4, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-2, GPT-J, GPT-NEO\n\nQuick and accurate scoring\n\nUse without leaving Google Docs\n\n“Replay” How Your Students Wrote Their Papers\nAI Detection alone is NOT enforceable. Combining AI detection with a Document History Audit provides unparalleled confidence. All you need is edit access to the Google document the student submitted and Passed.AI can provide you a detailed audit. This audit allows you to…\n\n“Replay” at 10x speed\n\nSee the number of contributors and the size of their contributions to the text\n\nSee if the words/minute were natural or not\n\nNo software for your students to install\n\nSecure\nWe take security seriously with military grade 256 bit encryption. Your account and information is secure.\n\nAffordable for Teachers\nPassed.AI is priced with teachers in mind. We want to make this tool and workflow available to all teachers, regardless of your institution’s readiness to adopt.\n\nEasy to Get Started\nWhether you are a solo teacher questioning one paper or responsible for technology implementation at a top 100 university, you can try out Passed.AI today.\n\nLMS Integration\n(future) Push results from Passed.AI audit into your LMS using our REST API.\n\nPassed.AI works with any Google Doc to which a teacher has Edit access. Our Chrome extension shows the probability that a document was generated by AI, along with a Document History Audit that lets teachers “watch” a student write the text."
