Do you want to save money on your online shopping? Then this extension is for you!\n\nCheckr is a simple and easy-to-use extension that allows you to compare prices of products across different Amazon domains, specifically .ca and .com. With just a click of a button, you can see if you can save a significant amount by ordering the item from the other country.\n\nHere's how it works: when you're on an Amazon product page, simply click on the Checkr on the right side of the page. The extension will automatically compare the price of the same product on both Amazon.ca and Amazon.com.

You can then decide if you want to order from the other country and potentially save money.\n\nBy using Checkr, you can save money on your online shopping without compromising on quality. This extension is perfect for anyone who frequently shops on Amazon and wants to make sure they're getting the best deal possible.\n\nSo why wait?
