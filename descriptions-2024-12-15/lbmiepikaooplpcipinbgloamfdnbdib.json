Rather than telling the person to scroll down the page until they reach the specific point that you want to show them, just use Copy URL With Hash to send them a link that automatically takes them right to that section!\n\nCopy URL With Hash adds a context menu button when you right-click on an element in a webpage that has a specific ID. Then, if you click the \"Copy Page URL With Hash\" context menu button, it will copy the page's URL with the hash that identifies the location on the page. For more information, including a video example, see the add-on's homepage.\n\nThis will not work on every webpage; it all depends on how the author of the page designed it. If the author added many elements with IDs, then this add-on will work well on that page; if the author used absolutely no IDs, then this add-on will not be able to do anything on that page. (To test it, try right-clicking on headings in Wikipedia articles or on the headings on the add-on's homepage.)"
