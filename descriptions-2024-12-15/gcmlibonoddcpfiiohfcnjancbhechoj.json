We all know the drill: you need a new domain name, but you can't seem to find a cool one. You start to surf around the web, but you always need to switch to another tab to check if the domain name is still available. Sey hello to Walter!\n\nWalter the Domainastronaut assistant helps you finding your new domain name. With the extension you can just open the extension and check your domain name. It will even prefill for you. Just click and play. It's not needed anymore to switch tabs. Walter is finally here. \n\nWalter uses the Domainastronaut website to check on the domain names."
