These includes:\n- pull out discounted prices and sale badges from product lists, knowing that most of the products are not on a relevant discount\n- downplay sponsored results that usually appear at the top of the list\n\nHow it’s working?\nThis extension uses custom CSS rules that hide or adjust the site elements."
