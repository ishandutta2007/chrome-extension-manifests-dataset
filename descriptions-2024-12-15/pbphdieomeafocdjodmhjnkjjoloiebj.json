With this extension, when you visit the desktop version of a Wikipedia or Wiktionary article (or any article on a Wikimedia site), you will be taken to the mobile-optimised version of that page instead.\n\nFor example, if you visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis you will be taken to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis. If you visit https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/botany you will be taken to https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/botany. The exception to this is if you are editing an article. In that case you will be taken to the desktop version of the site, which you may find easier to use and more fully-featured when editing.\n\nYou can control this extension with the toolbar menu, which allows you to switch it on or off, and whether it should take you to the desktop version to edit an article.\n\nIf you would like to see the code that powers this extension, please see the GitHub repository here: https://github.com/beingmrkenny/WikimediaRedirect"
