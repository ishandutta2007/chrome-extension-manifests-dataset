With an advanced detection system, it allows you to see detailed information about each blocked request, including the tracker's name, domain, path, parameters, and full URL. The goal is to protect your privacy by preventing trackers from monitoring your browsing.\n\nAdditionally, we offer a reporting feature: if you discover new trackers that aren't blocked yet, you can easily report them through a dedicated form. Together, we can make the web a safer and more private place."
