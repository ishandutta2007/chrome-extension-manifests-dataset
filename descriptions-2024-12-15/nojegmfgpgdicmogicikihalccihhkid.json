PMCA helps you to practice in the most efficient way.\n\nGET STARTED\n1. Install the PMCA extension in your web browser.\n2. Solve and submit LeetCode problems. Upon a success submission, PMCA sets the next review time for the problem based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.\n3. Open PMCA to view problems that need to be reviewed now, problems scheduled for future review and mastered problems. You can use the switch in the popup page to switched between the LeetCode global site and the LeetCode CN site.\n4. Enjoy coding!"
