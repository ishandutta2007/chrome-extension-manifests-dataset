When users accidentally trigger one of these websites, the NO extension helps their mental digital wellbeing by closing the tab immediately. To remove a website from the list, just click the red \"X\" button next to it, to remove it.\n\nThe extension does not track users and doesn't not sell your data to foreign governments."
