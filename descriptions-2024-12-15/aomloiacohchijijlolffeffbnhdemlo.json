It's easy as 1-2-3 and you just have to click the icon to get a fresh new passphrase. The passphrase is randomly generated by taking 5 words long between 5 and 8 characters and with the first letter capitalized. You will have the opportunity to copy that passphrase in the clipboard so that you can paste it wherever you need to write a new password. It's time to ditch complex but hard to remember passwords and to embrace very solid and easier to remember passphrases."
