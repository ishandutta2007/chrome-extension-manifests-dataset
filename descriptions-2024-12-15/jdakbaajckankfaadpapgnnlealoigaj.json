Instead of typing the URL of the site, going to the site, and typing again to look for a movie or a show, our extension provides you with a shortcut to perform a quick search using simple commands directly from your Chrome’s address bar. \n\nHere is how it works after the extension has been added to your Chrome:\n\nStep 1: Go to the address bar and type @; a list of five default movie sites and their respective hotkeys will show up in the autocomplete results.\n\nStep 2: Type the hotkey of the site you want to search on, after the @ symbol. For instance, the command “@imdb” stands for IMDB. Check out the “special features” section below for the full list of hotkeys that you can use.\n\nStep 3: Leave one-character space after the hotkey and type the name of the film or show that you are looking for. For instance, the command will look like “@imdb titanic” if you want to look for “Titanic” on IMDB.\n\nStep 4: Choose one of the autocomplete suggestions and you will be redirected to IMDB’s results page.\n\nPermissions used and reasons:\n\n1.
