It is based on a number of automatic tests and machine learning.\n\nWho is it for?\nThe service is meant for everyone who wants to shop safely online and who is concerned about the safety of their personal data. \nProtect-ID, for example, helps you decide whether you should trust a eCommerce site with your credit card information. \n\nOnline merchants can use Protect-ID to find and eliminate flaws in their eCommerce sites. This way they can ensure better shopping experiences for their customers.\n\nWhat separates Protect-ID from TrustPilot, MyWOT etc?\nMost of these services are basically extortion companies - bad reviews can be removed when the website owner pays for a premium service - this is called blackmail.\nProtect-ID believes in fairness and neutrality. Decisions about the visited site are only made by computational algorithms and not sales teams. \nAll data is public and website owners can use it to make their systems better. Transparency is the key to real trust!\n\nWhat we believe in?\nFairness, transparency, hard work"
