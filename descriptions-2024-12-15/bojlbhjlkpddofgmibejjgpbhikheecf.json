Efficient against 0-day scam websites and known scam websites.\n\n2. Anti-Phishing - APHISHI protection filter. APHISHI uses image-similarity algorithms to avoid phishing risks. The web-page screenshot is matched against leading Login-Screens of top websites such as Amazon, Goggle, Bing, Yahoo etc, If a match exists and the URL does not belong to these leading domains the page triggers a phishing warning.  This approach is efficient especially against 0-day phishing attacks.\n\n3.
