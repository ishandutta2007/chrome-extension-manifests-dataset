The activities are administered and managed via ATPT (Clicks To Live). ATPT allows:\n\n- Create and manage components and activities to perform actions that constitute a test\n- Connect multiple component to form a flow \n- Create and export flow groups\n- Cover all flows with different crawlers/browsers under 1 test \n- Data-driven tests that feed input data dynamically\n- Create concise summaries and detailed HTML reports\n- Screenshots at every step of the test \n\n\n• No prior experience to testing is required.\n• Inbuilt mechanisms to minimize maintenance caused by changes in the UI \n• Multiplatform Execution (windows/unix/Mac)\n• Does not require skilled Automation Test Engineers\n• Few clicks to master Automation!"
