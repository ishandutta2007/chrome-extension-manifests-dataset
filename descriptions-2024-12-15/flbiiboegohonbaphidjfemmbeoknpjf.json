Extension does not pass any important information with these messages, these messages are only there for \"signalling\" the nativeMessaging host script (local compilation server script) to run. The mentioned script must be downloaded manually by user, there is no script included in the extension package. The extension is not interactive, it automatically checks whether the user is using the mentioned add-on to compile LaTeX and executes the mentioned script. In addition to that,  the extension provides a dark theme functionality."
