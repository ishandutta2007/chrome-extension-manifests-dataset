For example, if you are constantly visiting the same Wikipedia page over and over, each time you are wasting approximately 0.012kWh. Over time, this builds up! In fact, if each person using the internet does this once per day, this is approximately 60 million kWh!\n\neBrowse keeps track of how much power you waste by visiting the same pages over and over again so that you can become more conscious of your internet usage. It will also keep track of which page you frequent the most.\n\nCo-authors: Diego D., Alexander M."
