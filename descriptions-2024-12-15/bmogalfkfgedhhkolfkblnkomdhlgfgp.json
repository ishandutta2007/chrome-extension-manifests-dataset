Once you find what you want to clip, either right-click the image or click the extension icon on your browser bar. We'll ask for some basic information and save it to your account for you.\n\nIf you're clipping a style:\nFor any retailers that offer commissions, we'll let you know how much you can expect for influencing that sale. You're also welcome to clip styles from other retailers, we just won't be able to offer any commission on those. When you get back to Pixavo, you'll find these under the \"Clipped\" department wherever you search and filter for styles.\n\nIf you're clipping an image:\nSometimes you just need to spruce things up a bit, right? If all you need is the image, you can choose that too. When you get back to Pixavo you'll find these under \"Images.\""
