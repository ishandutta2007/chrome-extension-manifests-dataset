This extension is for you! No longer will you have to skim a 2-4 hour podcast, lecture, or video to search for the part that you're interested in. With this extension, simply search for the keywords and go to that relevant part of the video.\n\nThis extension looks at a Youtube video and if a transcription is available, grabs the timestamps and text for that video and then allows the user to open up the extension to search for the keywords that they're interested in. Once the user searches the keyword(s), it will generate a list containing the timestamp and text that contain that keyword(s) to then allow the user to jump to that section of the video."
