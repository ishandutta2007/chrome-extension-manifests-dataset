(e.g., someone using a web-based computer forensics tool looking at potentially deliberately tricky command lines)\n\nThis rips apart any highlighted text into its component Unicode code points, and shows how that text would be written in UTF-8 or UTF-16LE (UTF-16LE is what the Windows kernel uses for strings). It also allows one to edit UTF-8 or UTF-16 bytes and shows what strings they become. The byte representations can also use base64.\n\nTo cut down on memory use, this extension loads Unicode names (pulled from the UnicodeÂ® Character Database) into memory as needed on a block-by-block basis, so there may be a tiny delay when looking up the first character of a given block.\n\nPreferences are saved with \"Chrome sync\"; the most recently viewed string is saved locally."
