When it’s on manual mode, you need to type “@news” in your address bar, followed by the topic you want to look for, and click on the autocomplete suggestion to the result page. Once it’s set on automatic mode, you can type directly in your address bar the headlines/topics you look for and click on the autocomplete suggestions to see the results.\n\nYou can also select your favorite news categories from the extension’s dashboard (up to 3 categories), so when you type in your address bar, we’ll bring you the latest headlines to your autocomplete suggestion. Customize your extension experience by selecting your default search engine, news provider, country, language, and categories inside the extension’s Settings section.\n\nPermissions used and reasons:\n\n1. Access to “cookies” (optional). We require this permission to provide your customized options for Settings. It’s optional because if you don’t change any default settings, we will not need it. \n2. Change your default search engine to our private domain search.mybrowsingsafety.pro, powered by Yahoo. We require this permission to use our private domain as a placeholder and to provide you the functionality in the autocomplete suggestions of your address bar. Inside this extension, we support Yahoo, Google, and Bing. You can switch to a different provider at any time inside the Settings section.\n\nHow to remove this extension?\n\nIf you want to remove our extension, go to “Settings” on Chrome, and find our extension in the “Extensions” tab. Click “remove”. Alternatively, you can right-click on the extension’s icon on your browser and select “Uninstall” from the drop-down menu.\n\nChrome™  is a trademark of Google LLC.
