Now, the selected text will replace the existing content, providing a fresh space for each new selection. To complement this, we have introduced a visual feedback mechanism where the background of the prompt-textarea momentarily transitions from yellow to transparent, signaling the successful transfer of the selected text.\n\nEnhanced Prompt Detection: By adding two newline characters ('\\n\\n') after the selected text, we facilitate better prompt detection by ChatGPT, enhancing the clarity and structure of the conversation.\n\nHow It Works\nText Selection and Transfer: Highlight the text you wish to transfer. The extension recognizes the selection event and initiates the transfer, replacing the existing content in the prompt-textarea with the selected text, followed by two newline characters to aid in better prompt detection by ChatGPT.\n\nVisual Feedback: Post the text transfer, the prompt-textarea undergoes a smooth background color transition from yellow to transparent, providing a visual cue of the successful text transfer.\n\nFocus and Scroll: Following the transfer, the cursor automatically positions itself at the end of the transferred text, ready for your next input, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted workflow."
