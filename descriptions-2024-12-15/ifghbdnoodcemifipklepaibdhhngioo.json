This extension is not part of their development team and I am not associated with the site or its parent companies in any way, shape or form.  I'm just an avid user and fan of the site looking for a better day-to-day use.\n\nHere are some of the things the extension does:\n- Automatically checks for \"alerts\" (new replies, private messages, etc) on a 45 second interval, there is no need to refresh the page.\n- Adds styles to various data points of the thread lists to make it more readable\n- Undoes the \"Signature Overlay\" feature.\n- Shows a user's signature only once per thread page view (useful when someone has a huge/annoying signature).\n- Adds ability to hide threads you may find irrelevant on the list pages.  For instance I live in Florida, I can easily hide a thread about a meetup in Los Angeles.\n- Optionally leverage Google for search functionality instead of the built in engine.\n- Adds extra navigation links to the top of the page making it less clicks to get what you need to get to.\n\nPlease note: I do not address hiding or removal of advertisements from the site as that is how they make their income.  If the ads are overbearing, please consider becoming a \"Premium\" member, this removes almost all of the annoyance.   Support the developers for their hard work!"
