Please make sure that you select a phone number that has either + in front of the country code or has the proper country code prefix and that there are no local dialing digits in the middle, which could result in error messages.\nWe hope our dialer will help you make many successful business calls. \n\nGlobal Call Forwarding / United World Telecom"
