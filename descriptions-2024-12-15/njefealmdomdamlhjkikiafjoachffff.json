This Chrome Extension allows you to create multiple sets of custom labels which can easily be loaded into the Invoices configuration screen with this Chrome Extension.\n\nShow me a use case\nThe best use case would be the support for multiple languages. Some countries have strong rules defining the language your invoice should be in. While internationally you can often get away with English, local invoices sometimes require you to invoice in the language of your region. With this extension, you can easily create a custom set of labels and load them into the Harvest configuration when invoicing.\n\nHow does it work\nLog into Harvest and go to Invoices > Configure > Translations, or type in the URL youraccount.harvestapp.com/invoices/translations (replace youraccount with your account name).\n\n\nFirst save the default values by providing a name (e.g. English or Default) and hitting save.\n\nReplace all the labels with your new labels (e.g. another language, custom names for specific clients, etc.). Click on the Custom Invoices for Harvest button in Chrome, type in a name for this new set, and hit save!\n\n\nRepeat this process for more sets of labels.\n\nWhen you need to invoice with a specific set of labels, go to the Translations configuration page again, hit the Custom Invoices for Harvest button, and load the desired set by clicking on its name. You will see the labels being replaced by the saved set. Hit the \"Save Translation\" button on the Harvest page, and create and send your invoice!\n\nQuestions, comments,...\nThis is a simple solution that I personally needed to support multiple languages for my local and international clients. In case of any remarks or questions, contact me on @svencharleer.\n\nThis extension is not affiliated with Harvest. It is a temporary solution until the wonderful folk at Harvest provide a multi-translation feature (which they said is on the todo list!)"
