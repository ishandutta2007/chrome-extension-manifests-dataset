But how do I know who to ask? Currently, the only way to see how you're connected to someone on Twitter is through which people you follow also follow that person.\n\nBut what you actually want is to get an intro from:\n   (1) someone who the target follows \nand\n   (2) someone who's following you\n\nIf someone is following me that means I easily can ask for a good intro. And if the target is following that person that means that theyâ€™ll be very likely to take the intro. This extension tells you exactly who to reach out to for a maximally successful intro!"
