I built this to make our large group meetings easier, as it's often difficult to determine who has already given their update or who should be next. This extension can also be used to take attendance or randomly select participants.\n\nIt includes 4 commands:\nRandomize (generates a randomly sorted list of names)\nResync (keeps the list order the same, but adds / removes guests who have joined or left)\nCopy (copies the list of names to the clipboard)\nAutopost **New** (automatically posts to chat window when generating or resyncing lists)\n\nYou can view the source code to this project here https://github.com/LambyPants/google-meet-randomizer\n\n3.0.0 update - adds support for new Google Manifest to remove warnings\n\n2.0.0 update - supports redesigned UI of Google Meet. Contact the developer if issues persist.\n\n2.2.0 update - supports new UI of Google Meet\n\n2.2.1 update - fixes bug with resync\n\nSome users have complained this extension doesn't work for them; I am guessing it's because the UI of Google Meet may vary region-to-region. If you experience issues please reach out to me and include (a) your region and (b) what error message, if any, you are encountering."
