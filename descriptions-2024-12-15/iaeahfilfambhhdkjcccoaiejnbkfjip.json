You can then click on any of the URLs to navigate to it. It only pulls from the last two weeks of history, so any URL you haven't visited in a while will drop off of the list.\n\nThis functionality is similar to the old \"address bar\" dropdown found in past versions of other browsers.\n\nFor URLs that you occasionally type in (but not often enough to make bookmarks for them), it's nice to have a list of items you can quickly pick from."
