If someone has any suggestions, I would be glad to improve it.\n\nFuture versions:\n- add whitelist and completely remove the requirement of logging in to Youtube account ( the ability to download subscriptions from account will stay, but it will be possible to have feed from not-subscribed channels)\n\nYoutube is a trademark of Google Inc.
