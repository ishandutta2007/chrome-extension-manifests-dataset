For some reason Google won't just let you delete all photos in Google Photos, so this extension automates selecting all photos and deleting them so you don't have to manually click hundreds or thousands of photos. This will help a lot to get rid of the ‚ÄúGmail is almost out of storage‚Äù message.\n\nüåü ‚ÄúThe only way to easily remove your Google Photos library. Saved me literally hundreds of hours of boring clicking. Thank you.‚Äù ‚Äì Reviewer.\n\nAfter you install the extension, a screen with deletion options will appear. A confirmation screen is shown before the deleting process starts. Then just leave the browser tab open and let it work. \n\nBy default, there is a limit of 200 deletions per day. For a small one-time payment that buys lifetime access to the extension on any browser, you can delete without any limits. This is to make the extension worthwhile to update and maintain. Some people don‚Äôt realize the amount of work that goes into extensions and think everything should be free. Making good extensions is hard work and requires compensation!  We hope you'll understand. ü•∫\n\nNote: this extension does not read, store, or transmit your Google Photos or other browsing data in any form. The extension needs permission to access extensionpay.com to manage your paid features, but no information is shared with this site.\n\nPlease consider leaving a review! Many reviewers try the extension once, there's a bug, they leave a bad review, the extension is fixed, and then they never update their review, leaving other potential users with a mistaken impression. Your review would help correct this which would help many people, including me. Thanks! \n\nChangelog:\nv2.3 ‚Äî Fix another change that Google made.\nv2.2 ‚Äî Google changed a button slightly, breaking the extension. This update fixes that.\nv2.1 ‚Äî Fixed bug caused by Chrome v130 that made extension not work at all.\nv2.0 ‚Äî Upgraded limit on free deletions per day, added more payment methods.\nv1.8 ‚Äî Added ability to choose which Google account to delete from.\nv1.7 ‚Äî Extension will now keep working when each batch of photos takes a long time to delete.\nv1.6 ‚Äî Slight name change\nv1.5 ‚Äî Fix French and Chinese language errors.\nv1.4 ‚Äî Even more robust deleting for large photosets or slow browsers.\nv1.3 ‚Äî Much faster deletion and more robust deleting for very large photo sets.\n\nChrome version: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/delete-all-google-photos/bebhhjmapjadpdkkhbkpnpbjhkhndofl\nFirefox version: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/delete-all-google-photos/ \nEdge version: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/delete-all-google-photos-/hjgdldioiodafdmdgcjjpknbdbcjmnmp"
