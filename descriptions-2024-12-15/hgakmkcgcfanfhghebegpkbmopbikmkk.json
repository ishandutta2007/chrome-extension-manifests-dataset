Create ABUkmarks that automatically update as you read webcomics, wikis, or blogs, and even watch YouTube!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nSay you create an ABUkmark on Page 1 of your favorite webcomic. When you continue to Page 2, your ABUkmark automatically becomes a bookmark to Page 2; go to Page 3, your ABUkmark updates to become a bookmark to Page 3; and so on.\n\nLater when you open up the ABUkmarks folder and click on your new ABUkmark (maybe after moving it out onto the Bookmarks bar) you'll continue reading from Page 3, right where you left off!\n\n(This also works for YouTube playlists, or even saving your spot inside of individual videos)\n\nIf you don't want to add to your giant list of bookmarks, you can convert existing bookmarks to ABUkmarks instead of creating new ones!\n\nYou can even have multiple ABUkmarks for different sections of the same website. You can follow all of your favorite websites' webcomics and blogs!\n\nThanks to the following for the use of their webcomics for screenshots:\nLaura Cooper (XP): http://xpwebcomic.com/\nKirsty Mordaunt (164 Days): http://164days.co.uk/\nPascalle Lepas (Wilde Life): http://www.wildelifecomic.com/\n-----------------------\nABU 1.4 Updates:\n-Special fix for MangaHub.io\n-Altered some text for clarity\n\nABU 1.3 Updates:\n-Added support for Google Sheets\n-Added support for saving your time in YouTube videos (individual videos, and videos in a playlist)\n\nABU 1.2 Updates:\n-Icon is now gray when ABUkmarks aren't used on the current page (rather than a hard-to-differentiate green)\n-Completely reworked methods for tracking the current webpage, so it should work for even more sites now and be faster!\n-ABUid shouldn't break webpages anymore\n-Convert ABUkmarks in lower levels of a site to higher levels safely\n-Updates ABUkmarks of webpages not currently focused on\n-Remove ABUkmarks from list when they've been manually deleted\n-On unABUing, remove ABUid from bookmark URL\n-Performance improvements\n-Special fix for Webtoons (should get correct URL every time now)\n-Special fix for Lezhin (should get correct URL every time now)\n-Support for Tapas (their URLs are weird)\n-Support for YouTube playlists\n\nAt this point, I'll only be updating ABU to fix bugs and add website support. If you find a bug or unsupported website, email me at joshuapowlison@gmail.com (I don't get notifications from the support page, unfortunately)!\n\n-----------------------\nPotential Fixes (If people care- if you do, email me!)\n1. Support for YouTube mini player\n2. Support for YouTube videos playing in background\n3. Don't update YouTube time in querystring- this was an easy solution, but it means when you share videos you'll be sharing them from your current spot.\n\nFeel free to ask for support via GitHub, email, or PM on Twitter!"
