You may not know how much time you are spending on Reddit when you mindlessly click over \"for just a minute\". They add up, and there are big context switching costs too. Recenter helps you understand where your time's being spent. More importantly, recenter actively reminds you, and nudges you into doing the right thing.\n\nRecenter's code is open-source to ensure transparency and safety.
