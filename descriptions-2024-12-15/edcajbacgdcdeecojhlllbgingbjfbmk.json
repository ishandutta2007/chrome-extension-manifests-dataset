Protect yourself against malware and nefarious extensions that seek to compromise your browsing safely.\n\nPrivacy guard has many features to protect you from malware and unseemly applications. It is an open source project: https://github.com/kzahel/privacy-guard-extension\n\nUpdate Feb 29 2020\n- Remove unused notification permission \n\nUpdate Dec 1 2014\n- Changed name of app due to trademark conflict with privacyguard.com (credit monitoring service)\n\n- Check permissions of installed extensions\n- See extensions and apps with high risk permissions\n- (soon) Identify changes to app publisher\n\nSept 12, 2014 - version 0.1.4\n- Updated to detect \"high risk\" apps.\n\nJan 21, 2014 - First released. I wrote this app because I couldn't find anything else like it in the chrome web store and there's been a lot of buzz about chrome extension malware recently. I have some ideas for further improvements to make to this app, but welcome your feedback!"
