That little nudge kept me returning to my learning, and I wanted to share that gentle push with you.\n\nThe Essence: \"Stay On Track\" ensures that a particular web page (your \"Attention URL\") remains front and center during your browsing sessions. Whether you're diving into a tutorial, working through an online course, or just reading an article, this extension helps keep that focus alive.\n\nHow it Works:\n\nSet Your Focus: Choose an \"Attention URL\" â€“ this is the webpage you want to keep coming back to.\n\nSeamless Return: Every time you switch away and then come back to Chrome, our extension either opens the Attention URL or shifts your tab's focus to it. It's a gentle reminder that there's something waiting for you.\n\nDelay for Flexibility: Frequent alt-tabbing? Set a delay to determine how often you're nudged. Once the timer is up, the next time you come back to Chrome, you'll be redirected to your Attention URL. No constant annoyances, just timely reminders.\n\nSmart URL Tracking: Navigate freely within your \"Attention URL\" domain. Whether you're progressing through lessons or exploring related pages, our extension ensures you won't be rudely pulled back to the starting point. Stay immersed without interruptions.\n\nLet your browsing experience help, not hinder, your goals. \"Stay On Track\" serves as a subtle, digital tap on the shoulder, reminding you of the tasks or learning you've prioritized. Dive in, and let's stay focused together!"
