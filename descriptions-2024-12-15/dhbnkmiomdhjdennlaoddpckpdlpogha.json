Google Analytics has a neat little script that can be prepended to the top of web pages to tell them you’re opting out of tracking.\n\nUseful things to know\n\n- When starting an experiment you may receive a message to “Check installation”. The “check installation” feature takes place in your browser. When the extension is enabled you have been opted out of Google Analytics and Google Optimize interprets as the Analytics property missing from the website. You can ignore this message."
