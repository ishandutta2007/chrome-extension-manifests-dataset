Unknowingly sending an email outside of your domain or organization (Gmail will only warn if the recipient is not already in your contacts, which most of us don't remember to use)\n2. Mixing up mails to multiple contacts from multiple companies - avoid that 'Oops, I cc'd the wrong Tony'\n\nThe implementation is based on the gmail JavaScript client - https://github.com/KartikTalwar/gmail.js)"
