However, the download speed can be very slow, leading to wasted time.\n\nThis extension provides an alternative link on the original page for those who want to download more efficiently. The link uses a customized mirror address to speed up access. Taking the mentioned URL 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09755' as an example, its original download link is 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09755'. This extension adds a new link below the original download link, shown as 'Mirror link' on the HTML page, whose actual link is 'http://custom-mirror/pdf/1806.09755'. This offers a much faster download experience.\n\nTherefore, this extension is simple but very helpful."
