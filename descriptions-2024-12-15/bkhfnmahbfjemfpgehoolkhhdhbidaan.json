Load testing is a way to ensure that the websites and apps you are building remain fast and responsive under heavy load. With Loadster, you can create test scripts simulating real user behavior, and then play them back with hundreds or thousands of concurrent simulated users.\n\nYou can also use Loadster for 24x7x365 Site & API Monitoring with the same scripts. Site monitoring makes the job of maintaining a high availability web application much easier, and ensures you'll be the first to know if anything breaks.\n\nThis Chrome extension works by observing your browsing activity (only when recording is enabled), and sharing it with the Loadster script editor for creating a script.\n\nThis extension can be disabled when you're not recording scripts.\n\nTo learn more about Loadster and script recording, check out https://loadster.app.\n\nTo review the extension source code, go to https://github.com/loadster/loadster-browser-extension."
