Me too.\n\nI made this extension to promote positive mental well being of users and content creators alike. An AI will analyze the text of each Youtube comment, and if deemed toxic, will toggle the comment off.  The comment is still viewable by clicking the \"Toggle Comment\" button where the hidden comment used to reside.\n\nThe extension has 3 modes - Off, On (default), and Cautious Mode.  In Cautious Mode, the AI will cast a wider net, and things that may not be negative could be flagged and toggled.  \n\nIt's my hope this extension brings a more positive experience to anyone who uses it.  If you like it, please give it a good rating and spread the word.\n\nFuture plans - extending functionality to Reddit and possibly Twitter.  Tweaking the AI so it's better at recognizing negative comments."
