Are you currently spending hours doing product research and sifting through search results manually?\n\nThe extension is designed to help Amazon Influencers select products that offer the best performance for video reviews. This extension streamlines the product selection process for Influencers, allowing them to quickly and easily identify the best products.\n\nWith Fluencer Fruit, Influencers can sort for search results for products based on specific criteria, such as commission rate, commission amount, and Fruity score. The extension also provides a way to quickly see how many other Influencers are on a listing.\n\nThe extension also scores each listing based on potential of showing up on the listing in the upper carousel.  This proprietary score is based on Influencer results for which key factors impact how a shoppable video performs for exposure and earned commissions.\n\nVideo Placement management can be time consuming and draining.  The Fluencer Fruit extension allows you to see which videos have placement and which have fallen off.  No more clicking in and out of every video, listing and carousel to see where your video is, or isn't, on the product listing!"
