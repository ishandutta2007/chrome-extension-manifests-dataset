We know that Google Chrome's history doesn't help. Its elements are cluttered and sometimes you can't retrace your steps. \n\nAdvanced Project History allows you to improve your productivity in your Internet searches. Have a search history that tracks every step you take in a much more intuitive way, add notes to web pages to remember the most important of each one. All of this organized by different projects and sync with all your computers, so that the browsing data of your class work or office work does not get mixed up with the browsing data of the gift you were thinking of buying.\n\nAdvanced Project History - Work as usual, search faster"
