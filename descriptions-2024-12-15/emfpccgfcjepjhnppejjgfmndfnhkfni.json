With this plugin, sessions can be shared across browsers, which is ideal for crawlers to crawl the interface and page content of websites with authentication. The plugin provides a very convenient way to maintain and manage website cookies. For the security of cookies, you have full ownership of the data, all cookies are encrypted and stored, and the encryption key is only in your own hands."
