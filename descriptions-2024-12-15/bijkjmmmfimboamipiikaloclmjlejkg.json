To make the job easier on the HR department, they use something called an Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) to filter out applicants. The software runs through your resume and checks for specific keywords against your resume. Most job descriptions contain these keywords, and tailoring your resume to them can help you get past the system! This is where beATS comes in. It scans through the job description and displays the top keywords used, and these are the ones that are most likely going to be in ATS. Now, this doesn't guarantee you will get an interview but it will sure help get your resume in front of the recruiter. \n\nIts simple to use:\n1) Copy any job description\n2) Open the extension\n3) Paste \n4) Use the keywords given and add them in your resume (where it makes sense of course)\n\nThats it! \n\nHappy Hunting!"
