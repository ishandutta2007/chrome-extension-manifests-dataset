Manifest V3 and fixed permissions based on Googles new ToA. All features should work. Let me know if you have issues...\n\nPast Changelog: (mm-dd-yyyy)\n\n10/01/2021 - 2.1.0.0\n - Both the old and new Funimation players are supported now. Funimation will likely roll out the new player to everyone over the next few months. In the meantime, both work. All new features will only be added to the new player.\n - Core code no longer massively optimized... Yeah, it isn't pretty supporting both. But it should still run totally fine.\n - Popup added back, even for the new player. I was surprised how many people wanted this.\n - Fixed a few bugs with the new player integration.\n - New player integration is much smarter. Even works if you hit F11 or any other fullscreen mode.\n\n09/23/2021 - 2.0.0.0\n - Fixed to work with the new funimation web player.\n - Core code massively optimized.\n - Button panel removed, simply use the new player UI and the extension will do the rest.\n - Pop-out mode removed. With the new Funimation player, there is no reason for this addon to support this directly. If you want that functionality, you can use another extension like \"Open-as-Popup\". If you really want this added back in, let me know!\n\n05/01/2021 - 1.6.1.2\n - Fixed to work with new site version. It looks like Funimation may be starting to host sperate site layouts per language/country. So if you have issues, please contact me and we can try to work it out.\n\n07/19/2020 - 1.6.1.1\n - Fixed issue where video did not resize correctly when exiting fullscreen.\n\n01/26/2020 - 1.6.1.0\n - Should only active on player pages now. \n\n01/24/2020 - 1.6.0.2\n - Fixed issue where popular shows page would lockup if fullscreen-windowed was enabled. \n\n01/15/2020 - 1.6.0.1\n - Fixed issue where scrollbar would appear.\n - Removed \"Funimation Fullscreen\" text. Was just a waste of space.\n - Controls transitions are now faster to be less intrusive.\n - Controls now properly hide when your mouse cursor exits the window. It should react similar to the default controls now.\n\n01/14/2020 - 1.6.0.0\n - Fullscreen now fullscreens and fullwindows smartly. You can now simply click the fullscreen button to fullscreen everything at once. It will remember your previous mode settings when you exit fullscreen.\n - Codebase cleanup and features added for more robust feature set in the future versions.\n\n01/13/2020 - 1.5.1.0\n - Fixed issue where page scrolling would not work sometimes on show details page.\n - Cleaned code and optimized code injection for faster runtime experience\n - Better workarounds to limit required permissions (Due to this, the extension should be compatible with other browsers)\n - Added in code for always on top... but it doesn't work yet. Permissions for developers to use these features have to be enabled by Google/Mozilla, etc... Cross our fingers for these feature"
