Then FiveLoop is just what you are looking for!\n\nSet a loop and let the app repeat certain parts of the video. Adjust the tempo of the video in 5% steps. Transpose in halftone steps pitch shifting. Play/Pause and forward or rewind.\n\nYou can also use any MIDI-Controller or Bluetooth-Keyboard (keystrokes). Simply connect the to your phone or tablet and assign the keys to the buttons.\n\nFiveLoop is the perfect tool for anybody who is learning to play an instrument (e.g. guitar) thru videos.\n\nThe only data that is read and stored is which MIDI Switch should control which function. This is stored in the local storage of your chrome browser. No other or personal data is collected or stored.\n\nWrite me if you have any questions or requests for other video platforms.\nmail@duechtel.com"
