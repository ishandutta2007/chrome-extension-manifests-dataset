Simply add the host name and rules including a selector and \"remove\" as rule type.\n\nFor some sites you might want to change something such as background color, font size, etc. RuleMyPage is also capable of style changes. Choose \"style\" in rule type than add CSS in JSON format.\n\nThis is the initial version and new version will include lots of new features and better interactive UI.\n\nPlease write your comments about your thoughts, suggestions, bugs.\n\nAlso, advertisement is always necessary. This extension is for removing inappropriate things such as wrong aga content, aggressive elements, changing the styles to suite your eyes and habits."
