There are 4 specific features which are performed by this extension:\n\n1. Get customer information from the CRM Solve360 via API and post the information to the Dealer Management System, IDMS, also via API.\n\n2. Manage lead distribution by fairly and equally assigning new sales leads (sales inquiries from web forms on various vendor websites on the web) to available sales personnel via a round robin distribution method. The round robin is accomplished by both the salesperson being \"active\" on the system, and by the sales manager \"inserting them\" into the round robin. \n\n3. Inserting desired vehicle data into Solve360 from an inventory database allowing sales staff to quickly change from one vehicle to another without having to manually type the data into Solve360, taking much longer to accomplish thereby slowing down the deal process.\n\n4. Inserts newly acquired vehicle data into blogs in Solve360 where we then track all aspects of reconditioning such as location, repairs, expenses, and more. This extension programmatically handles the process by inserting new tasks / task lists in an automated manner when prior tasks have been completed using an \"if this, then that\" style logic."
