This can be very handy during an implementation when you are working on several environments at the same time (TEST-UAT-PROD).\n\nYou can configure your browser so that the extension opens with a keyboard shortcut in the \"Manage extensions\" screen. By that, opening the table browser goes very fast.\n\nNote that this extension only works with Dynamics 365 F&O cloud environments. On-premise installations are not supported."
