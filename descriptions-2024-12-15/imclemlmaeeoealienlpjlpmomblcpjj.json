Special algorithms to determine your screen size will cause your program descriptions to virtually \"explode\" onto the screen. No more getting up from your couch or using an external device to \"zoom\" your screen!\n\nAdditionally, direct links are included for both IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes so that you can go directly from a program description to these sites and view all pertinent information such as reviews, cast, director, etc.  This feature also removes advertising and magnifies their content as well for viewing across your living room. \n\nA built-in keyboard allows you to search for specific content.  Simply highlight and press the appropriate keys and they will automatically appear in the search fields for the associated screens!\n\nThe latest version includes a special feature that IMMEDIATELY removes items from the NetFlix \"Continue Watching\" list.  No more having to search out movies and tv shows that you only watched a few minutes in order to clear your list.\n\nPlease note that Bluetooth-enabled mouse is suggested depending upon the distance from your chair and the computer being used to stream your content.\n\nWarning: This product has only been tested with English language program descriptions. Descriptions in other languages may not display properly."
