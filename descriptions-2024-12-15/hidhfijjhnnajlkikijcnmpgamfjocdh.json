If it was - you see the number of upvotes and can quickly go and read the comments by clicking the icon. Which, we think, is the most valuable feature, since the comments at HN are at times more thoughtful and interesting than the actual content. If the current page has NOT been submitted to hackernews, you can do that by clicking the very same extension icon.\n\nCreated by JitBit (https://www.jitbit.com/) and Artiom Dashinsky (http://dashinsky.com/)."
