This tool is completely free!\n\nThis extension does that by making you think twice about links you press, showing you where links are really taking you, providing you with the email address of the sender, not just who they claim to be, and a step by step guide on how to spot a phishing email right beside your email as you read it. \n\nDon't worry! If you don't like one of these features you can always turn it off by clicking on the extension and then unchecking it. \n\nGmail is the only service that is supported currently, more services will be added soon."
