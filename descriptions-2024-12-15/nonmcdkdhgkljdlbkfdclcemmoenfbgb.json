Are you fed up of clicking 'Not now' every time Google Mail asks you whether it should send a read receipt? Do you wish there was a global 'don't send read receipts' setting?\n\nIf so, this extension is for you! When you install it, it will automatically choose 'Not now' every time you're asked whether to send a read receipt, and it's so fast you won't even see the dialog.\n\nIf you don't trust me, and want to see the source, it's at\n\nhttps://github.com/stephenlewis/no-read-receipts\n\nN.B. this extension is only useful for Google Apps users who have read receipts enabled - it's not for 'consumer' GMail accounts."
