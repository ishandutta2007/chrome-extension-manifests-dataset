You don't need technical skills anymore to make a manipulated video. You just follow an online instruction, that's enough.\n\nAt the same time, the videos are becoming more and more realistic.\nHumans are far inferior to AI when it comes to recognizing deepfake videos. Therefore, it is now possible to mainipulate entire societies, since the naked eye can no longer recognize deepfakes.\nThe question for everyone is how to protect themselves and others from this disinformation.\n\nPart of the solution is to critically question and check if what you see is plausible. \nIn addition, however, we need technical tools and have to fight AI with AI."
