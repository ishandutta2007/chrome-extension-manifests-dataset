My childhood consisted of bad 70’s haircuts and Crystal Cylinder T’shirts.\n\nPre-teens I started to take an interest in skateboarding, I faintly remember a thin black old school skateboard with red translucent polythene wheels. My dad was working long hours most of the time running various Golden Fleece and Caltex service stations.\n\n\nCreativity has been a strength of mine from a very early age, so much so that I believe that I am destined to create!\n\nAlthough sometimes it can be challenging, I view creating things as a form of expression and something that I need to do every day. I really do enjoy my working life as it involves exploring style, possibilities and solutions. I am proud of what I achieved in my career over the past 10 years. I would  like to thank the Fitzpatrick family who gave me the opportunity of lecturing at the Commercial Arts Training College as it assisted me in becoming a leading-edge designer, who is respected by his peers.\n\nEven now, I am regularly contacted by past students and peers who often request some help and advice in using programs and a variety of design issues (e.g. creative development in concept visualisation, typography and layout, digital design, packaging design, illustration, advertising communication, branding and portfolio preparation.)\n\nOverall, my career has taught me to innovate and develop solutions to the highest standard. Also, I have learnt and refined valuable personal skills such as problem-solving, negotiating and consulting with a variety of different stakeholders including students, peers, customers, staff and external suppliers on all levels.\n\nAdobe Creative Suite Tuition from CS - CS5 also available\nAs a qualified Adult Education Tutor I offer training and tuition to individuals or groups, either in a formal structured format or informal lessons, tailored to suit your requirements. From beginners to advanced level, everything can be covered for instance. Simply knowing photoshop and illustrator sometimes is simply not enough. Beginners often overlook the higher level of intergartion that the Adobe products provide."
