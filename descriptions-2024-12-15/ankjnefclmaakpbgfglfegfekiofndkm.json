Plus you can also generate simple or multi-series charts of your task's hours.\n\nIf you don't update hours daily on the Basecamp, and usually do this after a day, week or month; you know how tiring this process cold be. As when adding the back dated entries, you have to change the date every time, calculate the time spent on each task, and then post and verify each and ever entry time entry. If you share these feelings, then this extension is just what you are looking far.  With this extension, you can set a default date which appears in all time entries, set the default person for whom you are adding these entries (your seniors or boss?), and auto calculate the time spent on the task from the pasted description text (I love this one). If you want to learn more about this, check our this video tutorial:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo4AKy5Sukk\n\nAnother interesting extension of this tool is to generate the graph/chart of the time hours data. So if you want to visually see how much time you are spending on each project per month, or how much effort your team members are putting on different project per week, then this extension helps you generate all these graphs directly in your browser with few clicks. Check the following video for detail on this feature:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1qKqf-H5NY\n\nWarning: This extension is highly addictive, and there are good chances that it will make you even more lazy. I have warned you, so if you still use it, I'm not liable for any damage or claims, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with this extension or use of it."
