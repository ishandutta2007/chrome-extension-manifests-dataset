Examples include bullying, inappropriate behaviour online (such as in a video call), or a concern for someone's welfare. It is ideal for schools, colleges and Universities when students and staff are on-site and/or working at home making increasing use of online learning technologies. It is also perfect for charities and any organisation to help safeguard their people.\n\nThe message of concern will be sent to a designated representative in your organisation (for example, the safeguarding officer or team) and can include evidence such as a screenshot of the users current browser window as evidence, their GPS location and an attached file. Your organisation must subscribe in order to access the full functionality of the software. Details are available at https://www.safeguarding24.com\n\nNOTE: The Safeguarding 24 system does not store the reports or evidence and no personal information is kept from the user. The details of the message are immediately and securely sent to the designated contact in an encrypted email."
