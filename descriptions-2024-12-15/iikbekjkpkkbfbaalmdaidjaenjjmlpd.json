It is also used to sync this config to your profile (if you login in with your profile in another Chrome instance, it should retrieve the same config);\n- webNavigation: is needed to correctly trigger the check for the buttons when doing a client-side navigation, without a full page reload, such as what happens when you are in /pulls inside some repository and clicks on any PR. If, instead, you navigate directly to the PR URL, a full page reload happens, but this permission is still needed for the other cases.\n\nFeatures:\n- DONE: work when navigating directly to a PR link (full page load);\n- DONE: work when navigating from anywhere inside Github to the PR link (possibly a client-side render without full reload);\n- DONE: work when changing the config on the action popup;\n- DONE: work observing changes to the DOM that can be caused by changing the state of a PR;\n- DONE: show action icon with different colors (green/gray) according to the configuration for the current day;\n- TODO: detect end of current day/begin of new day, set PR button and extension icon accordingly;"
