You really like it and want to add it to one of the playlists you maintain on Spotify. SPOT reduces the manual steps required in order to achieve this, by directly querying the current playing video on your youtube tab, querying and displaying the results within the extension\n\n* You are scrolling through Instagram/Reddit/(any other website for the matter) and stumble across the name of a song in the caption/post and would love to check the song out. SPOT allows you to highlight this 'SPOTTED' text and find the best matching results on Spotify via the extension - by simplying triggering a search on right click, or by using the hotkeys 'CTRL + SHIFT+ S'  \n\nYou can scroll through all the top matches found, preview the selected song and add it to multiple playlists, all from within the browser - without changing any tabs/windows!"
