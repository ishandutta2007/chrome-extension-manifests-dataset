Unlike other focus mode extensions, this tool works on any website.\n\nA few examples of use cases:\n- clean up a flashy or cluttered UI and keep only important content on your screen\n- clean up a web page before printing or taking a screenshot\n- unhide content behind blocking dialogs\n- remove distractors (ads, auto play videos, annoying popups, huge headers and banners, etc.)\n\nHow to use:\n- Install the extension\n- Activate the extension (click its icon) when you wish to adjust a web page\n- Move your mouse to the element you want to hide\n- Click on selected element and watch it disappear\n- Deactivate the extension (click its icon again) to continue normal browsing\n\nA few facts about the tool:\n- It is small and simple, free and open-source\n- It does not collect any information and does not interact with internet\n- It is not active while you are surfing and does not consume any resources unlike adblockers\n- It was inspired by a same-name Google example\n\nDue to the static linking in the manifest, the Chrome Web Store might display a security warning. However, this method is the most efficient and reliable way to grant users full control over the content of any website.\n\nEnjoy!"
