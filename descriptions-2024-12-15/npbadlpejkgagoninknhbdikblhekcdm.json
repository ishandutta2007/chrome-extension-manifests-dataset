Simply enter their gamertag (not streamer tag) and when you/they enter an activity or location, the Grimoire for that activity or location will be displayed in your browser. Also, with the permission of http://www.isthar-collective.net , I have tied into their API as well to display any Categories that they have tied to events and locations.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions for this extension. Also, a huge thanks goes out to the whole Destiny Lore Community. Without them, their open hearts and minds - I would've never been inspired to start this project. So thank you all!"
