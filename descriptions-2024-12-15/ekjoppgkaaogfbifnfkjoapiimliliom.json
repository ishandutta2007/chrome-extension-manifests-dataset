These hateful messages directly promote Antisemitism and fake news, and they’re harmful in many ways. \n\nThe purpose of this extension is to create awareness around perpetrators of anti-Zionist sentiment on social media. Currently we’re operating only on LinkedIn.\n\nThe community adds problematic profiles to the database for approval by our team. New submissions are done via this form: –\n\nThen, if you have the extension installed, you’ll be able to view a special tag on any anti-Zionist profiles on LinkedIn, and act accordingly (for example, if you wish not to do business with such people).\n\nDisclaimer: We do not discriminate based on gender, race, religion or political views. Anti-Zionism is hate speech, and not specific to the political spectrum. \n\nIf you'd like to report an Anti Zionist, you can do it using this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZJhVhYGb2IFih27WTaRdI4QfPNvsMi7XEsi1-haxf_WL-lw/viewform"
