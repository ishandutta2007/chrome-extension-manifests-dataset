Simply click what you want and it will automatically be in your clipboard. \nThe snippets / code / text / etc... is currently personalized for me and will likely be only useful mainly for coders. I intend on allowing users to upload their own custom assortment. I made this awhile ago for personal use haven't noticed any bugs. Currently I would say the only thing I have noticed, is that the longer dropdowns can be harder to navigate. If enough people start using the extension ill rework the layout into something smoother."
