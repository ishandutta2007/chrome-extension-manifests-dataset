With this extension the browser will be automatically configured with the relevant proxy settings allowing VCD to act as a proxy for accessing vCenter Servers.  The extension will also perform authentication for you. Users have to verify they trust the extension as part of this workflow. The extension needs several permissions (proxy, storage, tabs, webRequest, webRequestBlocking) to automatically configure proxy and display state of proxy setup to the user. For questions, reach out to your cloud provider."
