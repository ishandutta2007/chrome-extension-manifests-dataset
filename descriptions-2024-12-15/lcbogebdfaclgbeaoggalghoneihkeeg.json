Manage all your email IDs in one mailbox with our Email Router.\nThis extension makes it quick and easy to compose emails or view, search, manage and create new email ids.\n\nMutant Mail allows you to overcome the headache of managing multiple Email ids with a privacy-focused, server-side solution.\n\nImagine having 5 domains, with 5 Email IDs each (admin, support, help, legal, contact). That's 25 Email IDs. Do we want to log in to every mailbox to keep the domain persona?\n\nMutant Mail lets you Receive, Reply & Send all Emails for your Domains from one Inbox while saving on Email Hosting.\n\nService comes loaded with advanced features like DMARC Report, Buffer / Batch emails into a digest, auto-reply email system as well as individual signatures for every email id.\n\nMutant Mail can double down to generate a random email address for every form that you're submitting online, which will forward all emails to your personal email address. This hides your true identity from the sender and protects you from spam. If later on, you don't want to receive emails from them anymore, you can disable or delete your address and be done with them! It's like your very own unsubscribe button that actually works on every email ever sent.\n\nTo use this extension you first need to register at (https://mutantmail.com) a free account with Mutant Mail.\nIf you already have an account, just go to the settings page and grab your API token.\n\nLet's make the world a better place, with one less thing to worry about by simplifying your email management."
