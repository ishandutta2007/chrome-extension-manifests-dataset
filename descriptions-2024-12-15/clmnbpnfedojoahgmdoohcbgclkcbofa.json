Not for the faint of heart, but you may adjust the delay between words and the per letter delay to slow down the text display.\n\nYou may have to refresh the page when you first install this extension to get it working.  \n\nPLEASE report any bugs or problems.  This is BETA but I would appreciate it that you do not treat it like a finished product until it's done.  I will make improvements.\n\nA unique icon is in the works, sorry about that!"
