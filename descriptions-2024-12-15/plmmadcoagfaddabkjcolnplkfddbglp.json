This information is then presented to the user in a friendly and easy to understand way.\n\nThe user can optionally allow the extension to actively warn them when it thinks the email is of concern and the frequency and threshold of these warnings is completely customisable.\n\nTop Features:\n- Detect and warn from potential phishing emails\n- Educate users on what to look for in phishing emails."
