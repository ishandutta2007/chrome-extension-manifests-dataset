If you are installing our extension for the first time, the extension would pop up a survey website to help us gather your understanding of GDPR-related questions and improve future versions of our extension. Also, you could return to the survey website after months and update your answers. Only if you consent, your survey responses will be used in our research. Please note that even if you consent, we will never collect your personal data. Furthermore, we donâ€™t store any personal identifiers in our collected survey data; any data collected will be used only for the purposes of non-commercial research, and all data will be deleted after the research project completes.\n\nIn \"Main Menu\" Panel:\nThe extension would automatically manage GDPR consent settings for all websites that the user visits, unless the user ticks the plus vector sign to uncheck the site from the auto protection. Apart form that, we provide a drop and drag to re-include those websites into the protection mechanism and withdrawal the previous consent as well. \n\nIn \"More details about sites\" Panel:\nProvide Information about the number of cookies stored in the in cookie, localStorage and sessionStorage, as well as the summarised classification result.\n\nIn \"Show all Cookies\" Panel:\n- We are using machine learning models to classify cookies into four categories: Strictly Necessary, Functionality, Performance and Targeting/Advertising Cookies. Considering the accuracy and prediction speed, we choose Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, providing over 90% accuracy of prediction.\n- We offer two types of cookie listing: cookies grouped by cookie categories, or cookies grouped by visited websites"
