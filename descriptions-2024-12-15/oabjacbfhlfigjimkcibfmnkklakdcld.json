However when one attains a high enough level, one's ability becomes good enough to learn a language in the language itself. \n\nThese monolingual definitions make that new word easier to remember and are essential to becoming truly proficient in a language. WordReference does have these, but the native language definitions being on the same page dillutes the power of monolingual definitions.\n\nThis extension hides the native language text in WordReference, allowing for no distractions to learn new words as if one were a native speaker learning them. If one needs the native translation, simply click on the hidden text to temporarily reveal it.\n\nAdditionally, this extension adds an extremely customizable copy button for each definition, making it easy for one to create electronic flashcards in just one click."
