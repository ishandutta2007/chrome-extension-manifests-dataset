By the time I'm finished, I have a messy list with multiple things crossed off and not to mention all the time it took to scan through each recipe. So I decided to create this chrome extension do to all that for me. I figured it would save me time and the headache of it all. \n\nAfter a couple hours I realized that I hated the idea of writing logic for parsing ingredient text. So I figured I could train Wit.ai to do it for me! Thus Laidle was born!"
