For instance, you won't be able to join a game you don't normally have access to or join a server of a player you can't follow.\n\nTHE USE OF ROBLOX TRADEMARK IS FOR IDENTIFICATION AND REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT IMPLY ANY ASSOCIATION WITH THE TRADEMARK HOLDER OF THEIR PRODUCT BRAND\nTHE EXTENSION IS COMMUNITY-MADE (IT'S NOT MADE BY ROBLOX CORPORATION)\n\n\nPossible usage (examples of links):\n- https://www.roblox.com/home?followUserId=1 - would make the client follow user ID 1 into the game the user is playing (only works if the player's privacy settings allow you to join them e.g. via the profile)\n- https://www.roblox.com/home?editPlaceId=920587237 - would try to open a place with that ID in the studio (won't work if you don't have permissions to edit that place)\n- https://www.roblox.com/home?placeId=920587237 - would open the client and join that place (won't work if you don't have permissions to play it)\n- https://www.roblox.com/home?placeId=920587237&gameId=8c7024c6-e89d-4bd1-977b-2c21fd8ed793 OR https://www.roblox.com/games/920587237/NAME?gameId=8c7024c6-e89d-4bd1-977b-2c21fd8ed793 - would open the client and join a server with that identifier (same condition as above applies)\n- https://www.roblox.com/home?privatePlaceId=920587237&privateId=efa67300-c5a1-47e6-a3d8-a9af904e6993 - would open the client and join a private server with that identifier (only works if you normally see the server under the `Servers` tab. In other case, use below method based on invite link)\n- https://www.roblox.com/home?privatePlaceId=920587237&code=wlH1zTFR3s3ZRNTbwzVL3530tVh2aHl1 - joins a private server using private server link (code comes from `privateServerLinkCode` parameter of Roblox's private server link)\n\nThe browser tab will be automatically closed after launching the app unless `dontClose=1` parameter is present in the link.\nAbove examples contain `https://www.roblox.com/home` base, but you may also use:\n- `https://www.roblox.com/groups`\n- `https://www.roblox.com/games`"
