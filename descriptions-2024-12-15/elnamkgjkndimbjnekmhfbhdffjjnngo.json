It is designed to help you navigate all of the reviews and features of Adult Trikes so that you can make a better decision about what sort of 3 wheel bike is appropriate for you.  For instance if you are a caretaker for a young adult with special needs, the sort of three wheel bicycle you need is going to be different than the type of 3 wheel bike that active retirees might want.  \n\nAnother thing to consider is the type of terrain on which you will be tricycling.  There are many adult tricycles that are single-speed.  This is a great option if you are on flat terrain since they are more cost-effective, require less maintenance, and are easier to assemble.  However, if you are using your new 3 wheel bike in hilly terrain, then you definitely need at least 3-speeds and preferably a 6-speed or even 10-speed trike.  This way you can make the pedaling easier on those hills!\n\nOne last factor to consider for adult tricycles is the cargo carrying capacity.  In addition to transporting their riders, adult trikes are ideal for carrying cargo, and many come with a built-in basket at the rear.  This provides for excellent stability since it is placed between the 2 rear wheels.  Some trikes can carry up to 60 pounds of cargo!\n\nSo, using this extension you should be able to enter your requirements and more easily navigate the adult tricycle reviews on our site."
