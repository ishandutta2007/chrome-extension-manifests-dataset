It's hard to stay focused on what matters in life when notifications and popups scream for your attention. Own Your Time will help give you a leg up keeping control of your browsing habits, even when Facebook wants to keep you logged on. Blacklist sites like on any other distraction blocker, but don't let the extension own your time either. You're free to visit your blocked sites whenever you want. Give a brief explanation for why you want to visit the site to discourage mindless browsing and encourage mindful internet use. This extension is in development, so feel free to suggest added features that would make your browsing experience easier to control."
