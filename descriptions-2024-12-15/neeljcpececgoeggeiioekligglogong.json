Unlock Chrome without having to go through any configuration to install proxies.\n\nTool does everything for you. All you have to do is have a package and enter your username and password in the extension. The extension will automatically integrate your browser to the proxy directly.\n\nThe tool allows you to use these features:\n\n- Choose rotating or sticky proxy method.\n(With rotating you get a new IP per request you make. Sticky is actually the reverse. With sticky proxy your IP stays the same when you make a request. In simple words, if you refresh the page, you keep the same IP which with rotating is reversed.)\n\n- Choose dozens of countries you want to connect to.\n\n- Completely free for our amazing customers. Not there yet? Try our service, our priority is quality, then you know for sure that you have come to the right provider.\n\nYou only need this tool and a Rainproxy package, you don't need anything else. We make everything easy for you so you can do your job.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nNote: When you open the extension, please enter your proxy name & password. Don't enter your Rainproxy credentials.\n\nFor example, if your proxy username looks like Rprxyuser1-cc-US, you have to enter those details only: \n\nUsername: Rprxyuser1\nPassword: Rprxyuser2\n\n* (DO NOT include -cc- etc)\n\nWe're open for any feedback you have. Please contact support@rainproxy.io for any feature requests or feedback."
