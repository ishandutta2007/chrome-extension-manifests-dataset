Increase engagement and also encourage and support other creators' by sharing their growth journey as well. \n\nWith GrowClout, these and many more features come directly to the BitClout web application itself so that user's don't have to go anywhere else. \n\nüë®‚Äçüíª GrowClout is open source. Check the following repos - https://github.com/paritoshM9/growclout-extension \nhttps://github.com/paritoshM9/growclout-backend\n\n                                                                          -----------\nAdvanced Details: \n\nGrowClout does not : \n\n‚ùå Access your seed phrase or BitClout Identity Service\n‚ùå Take any actions on your behalf \n\n‚úÖ It makes external calls to two servers. One is https://growclout.deta.dev/* which is where the backend lives and helps to fetch data for visualisation, register and deletion of GrowClout users. The other external service is Imgur (https://api.imgur.com/3/image) which hosts the plot image of user when he clicks on \"Share as Clout\" \n\n‚úÖ The Analytics Data for GrowClout user is tracked by calling official BitClout Backend APIs (https://docs.bitclout.com/devs/backend-api) periodically by GrowClout servers.\n\n‚úÖ We have kept privacy in mind. Users get an option on if they want to share their analytics data with public or not. If they disable public access, they can track their own data but not anyone else's data and vice versa. \n\n‚úÖ When a user first joins GrowClout, it starts tracking the BitClout data (coin price, followers, market capital) from that point onwards. It doesn't have the ability to show data before that point. \n\n‚úÖ You can see other creators' data only if they have also joined BitClout and have enabled public access. \n\n‚úÖ Once user signs out from GrowClout, the data collection stops until the user signs back in. However no previous data would be lost. \n\n                                                                          -----------\n\nIcons and Images Credits: \n\nI want to thank https://www.flaticon.com/ and the following designers for their amazing icons\n\n1.
