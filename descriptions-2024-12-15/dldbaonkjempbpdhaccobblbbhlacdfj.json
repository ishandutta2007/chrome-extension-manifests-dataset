Google's legacy Speedy Meetings feature tries to help, but in reality, everyone blows past those :25 or :50 meeting end times. It's just human nature.\n\nWhat if meetings started 5 minutes later instead? You're guaranteed a quick break between meetings to stretch, get coffee, and prepare for the next one. Your future self – and your meeting attendees – will thank you.\n\nThat's exactly what this extension does. Set your preferred start time buffer once, then enjoy creating Google Calendar meetings that start a few minutes later by default. \n\nIf you currently use Google Calendar's legacy Speedy Meetings feature, this extension supports that, too – so you'll be able to give yourself some time before and after your meetings."
