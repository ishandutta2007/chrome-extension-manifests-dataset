This extension was developed to extend the benefits of ChatGPT to automation developers. Microbots AI Platform is a non-commercial initiative aiming to be an AI experiment showing how automation development may look like in the future.\n\nThe Microbots AI Platform Extension is an innovative browser add-on for Chrome and Edge. It works by streamlining the HTML code of a webpage, omitting information irrelevant to automation, and building precise prompts sent to GPT model. The AI subsequently returns a fully functional automation that typically functions right out of the box.\n\nBy default, the extension generates solutions in Puppeteer, but the programming language can be adjusted in the prefix for Python Selenium or others as desired.\n\nAdditionally, the extension incorporates a \"Fix the Code\" feature, allowing users to input new commands or error codes to facilitate code correction. It also offers a Code Notepad for the input of intermediate code when necessary.\n\nAn important note: To operate the extension, users will need an OpenAI API key. This can be acquired by creating an account on the OpenAI portal (https://platform.openai.com/) and registering a credit card. Although ChatGPT 4 requires users to join a waiting list, the ChatGPT 3.5 model is immediately available, faster, cheaper, and perfectly adequate for this purpose.\n\nA single query generated by the extension may incur a cost ranging from $0.01 to $0.10 USD for the GPT 3.5 model and between $0.1 to $1 USD for a query to the GPT 4 model, so please mind these cost while using the tool.\n\nBy default, the extension generates solutions in Puppeteer, but the programming language can be adjusted in the prefix for Python Selenium or others as desired.\n\nAdditionally, the extension incorporates a \"Fix the Code\" feature, allowing users to input new commands or error codes to facilitate code correction. It also offers a Code Notepad for the input of intermediate code when necessary.\n\nThe Microbots AI Platform Extension empowers users to automate processes up to ten times faster, based merely on a list of steps or process description. Through this extension, we envisage a future where the role of the developer might be drastically minimized or eliminated, accelerating the process of automation.\n\nJoin us in this journey and let the AI revolution begin. Your feedback and experience with the tool are invaluable, so we encourage you to share your thoughts. The download link is available in the description.\n\nTerms of Use: By initiating the installation of this tool, you hereby consent to the ensuing terms and conditions of use. The \"Microbots AI Platform Extension\", hereinafter referred to as the \"Extenstion\" is provided to users free of charge, but it requires OpenAI API key, which can be aquired from the OpenAI platform https://platform.openai.com/.\n\nOpenAI API usage is a subjest of separate terms of use. Please check \n https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use to learn more.\n\nPlease note that the OpenAI API key is not bundled with this tool and therefore expected to be provided by the user. Any expenses incurred in relation to OpenAI are the sole responsibility of the user of the extension. \n\nOpenAI API Key will be stored in the Local Storage of the browser. Will not be transferred outside of the browser or your local machine and will be used solely to send requests to OpenAI servers.\n\nThe Microbots AI Platform Extension is delivered to you on an \"as is\" basis and carries no warranties or guarantees of any kind. By proceeding with the installation, you acknowledge and accept these terms in full."
