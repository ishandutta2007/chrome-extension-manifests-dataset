Yay!\n\nYou really don't need this anymore. I encourage you to uninstall it and I will eventually probably remove it from the web store.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe official California legal code website (https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml) is difficult to read because of its extensive use of structured headings and disdain for indentation.\n\nThis extension applies reasonable levels of indentation for each heading type in order to make the codes more readable. Due to indeterminate cases and inconsistencies in the heading system used by the California legal code, the formatter will not be 100% correct. However, in most cases, the indentation will reflect the intended structure of the law. \n\nAn in-depth explanation of the formatting logic, as well as the open-source code, can be found at https://github.com/stevenrchun/CalCodeFormatter"
