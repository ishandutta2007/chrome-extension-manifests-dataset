This privacy-friendly productivity extension can help you focus on the things that matter and keep you accountable by reminding you to see the links that you feel are important.\n\nOften, we forget to go through the links that we have bookmarked way back. Bookmark Butler will remind you to see those bookmarked links.\n\nHere are a few ways it will help you:\n\n> Reminds you to read any one random bookmark from your \"See Later\" bookmark folder everyday at a particular time\n> Keeps track of the time you are spending on any of the flagged websites. You can decide which websites to flag.\n> Shows a popup for the total daily time you are spending on the flagged websites.\n> Notifies you every hour you spend on flagged websites to read any of of your bookmarked links if you are spending too much time on flagged websites.\n> Lets you bookmark websites which you want to see later.\n\n\nFuture versions will include:\n\n> Ability to add todo items to the extension on the go.\n> Reminders about todo items\n> More 'single click' interactions to simplify common workflows like snoozing a website reminder, moving the bookmarks to different folders.\n\nNote: The extension is privacy-friendly. No data is collected from the user.\n\nI'd love any feedback on this extension. For any feedback, please email sarthakguptapro[at]gmail[dot]com."
