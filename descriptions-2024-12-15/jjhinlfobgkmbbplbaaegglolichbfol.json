It is the result of a research publication made by the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya publicly available at \"URL-based Web Tracking Detection Using Deep Learning\" (https://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/cnsm/cnsm2020/1570659553.pdf).\n\n- Deep Tracking Blocker runs locally in your browser and doesn't store any of your personal data. \n\n- DTB shows the users in every moment which requests have been blocked and it allows to unblock them one by one if they want in order to facilitate a more personalized experience.\n\n****************************************************************************\nCode of this extension can be found on: https://github.com/CBA-UPC/DTB\n****************************************************************************"
