A large 4 or 6 shows whether the outer page was fetched using IPv4 or IPv6.  If the page contains elements from other domains, then smaller numbers will appear alongside for those.\n\nWhen you click the icon, a table pops up, containing a row of information for each domain:\n\n- A padlock icon, for HTTP, HTTPS, or a mix of both.  This is helpful for tracking down mixed content warnings, but you shouldn't treat it as absolute security advice.\n\n- The IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If connections span more than one IP, then the most recent one wins.  When the connection is still open, the address is highlighted in yellow.\n\n- A \"cached\" symbol.  This mainly exists to warn you that no actual connections took place, so the IP address might be stale.\n\n- An \"S\" for WebSocket handshakes in Chrome 58+."
