We continued on radio in Melbourne on Casey Radio 97.7FM for many years. The G-Factor show was the primary drive for the success of the programs on both stations. The G-Factor show will continue to drive the program and way forward for M-Powa online radio.\n\nWe have extensive experience working with, and in various communities in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, through our Cultural Exchange Program. The program, established in 1999, includes education, technology, tourism, sport and the arts. The program serves to minimise isolation and foster unity through diversity.\n\nWe aim to include various community groups, schools, and organisations.\n\nWe will have a strong focus on promoting tourism in Western Australia, for the local and International market. It is not by chance, that the “WA” in M-Powa, represents the state of Western Australia.\n\nWe look forward to having you onboard, as a valued listener, or station partner/sponsor, for the long term.\n\nThank you\n\nBE EMPOWERED!"
