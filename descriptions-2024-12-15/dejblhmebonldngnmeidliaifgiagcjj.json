This was the start of the idea and it soon became mashed up with all the great Firefox quick find features that Chrome is missing.\n\nIf you like it please rate it and if you have any feature requests, questions or bugs you file it here: \nhttps://github.com/peterdotjs/quick-find/issues\n\nDemo\n------------\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2PEyTyJ6iM\n\nDescription\n--------------------\nNext generation text search. A new text search tool for your Chrome web page. Start a search and simply press enter/return on a highlighted link and you’ll instantly navigate to that page. A mashup of Firefox quick find features (case match, links only search, highlight all, search selected text) as well as awesome new ones (scroll/navigate through all search results with context) - brought to Chrome.\n\n\nSHORCUT KEYS\n---------------------------\n\nGetting started\n-----------------------------\n\n/  or  ctrl + shift + f  : forward slash or ctrl+shift+f will open Quick Find menu\n\n'  : single quote key will open Quick Find menu in links mode (only links are searched)\n\nesc  : escape key will close Quick Find menu\n\n\nMenu navigation\n-------------------------------\n↑  or  ↓   : navigate results by using up or down arrow keys\n\nenter  or  return : pressing enter on highlighted menu with link will navigate to the link\n\n\nSearch Options\n-----------------------------\nalt + a  : toggle highlight all results mode\n\nalt + c  : toggle match case mode\n\nalt + l  : toggle links mode\n\n\nTips\n-------------------\nQuick Find search box is pre-populated with any selected/highlighted text prior to opening the search menu.\n\nToggle occurs only when cursor focus is on the Quick Find menu.\n\n\nLimitations\n-------------------------\nExtension only works on sites that allow content scripts. The chrome webstore page itself for example doesn't even allow content scripts to be run.\n\nAfter you've installed it make sure you are using it on a newly loaded or refreshed page. The script won’t be loaded on existing tabs without a refresh.\n\nQuick find does not search through iframes, script, or code html elements.\n\nWhen results show up in same html element, will be shown only as one result.\n\nOther website shortcuts or extensions may conflict with these shortcuts. A future enhancement can be to select your own shortcuts to open the menu.\n\nAdditional Notes\n-------------------------------\nAnonymous page view tracking is used to improve the extension and user experience. You can opt out in the options menu.\n\nChrome is a trademark of Google Inc. Use of this trademark is subject to Google Permissions."
