The only way to generate your password is to enter the same phrase again, meaning the only person with the key to generating your passwords is you.\n\nUntil there's biometrics, there's Deadbolt!\n\nDeadbolt is available to view on GitHub - please track any issues or feedback here:\n\nhttps://github.com/bittenbytailfly/deadbolt-password-generator-chrome-extension\n\nFor updates and news please follow Deadbolt Password Generator on Google+:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/+DeadboltPasswordGenerator"
