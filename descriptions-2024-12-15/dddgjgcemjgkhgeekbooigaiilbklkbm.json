I simply needed a better task and productivity timer for my company, couldn't find one like I needed so created one.  I could probably sell it but helping others is what we do best at PMUSA (a Project Management Firm) so I decided when I first uploaded version 1 of this program to simply share with others the program for free.  \n\nTask Timer Pro also always remains in your browser bar for fast access, no full program to turn on and off, and isn’t over loaded with other features which really aren’t needed.  It was designed to be slick and to the point, fast to use because time is precious and if managed properly, you’ll greatly increase your productivity or even better your financial earnings!  \n\nTask Timer Pro is truly 100% FREE and has no nag-screens, advertising or anything else to eat up your time unlike many other programs available.  It was built for one thing only - Save Time and allow those who use it to be more productive and accountable to their daily tasks.\n\nSimply install and ENJOY!\n\nCreated by Michael D Baker\nProject Management USA"
