You can also set the option to automatically skip previously watched shorts.\n\nSetup instructions:\n1. Download the extension\n2. Start browsing, that's it!\n\nBy default, skipping previously watched shorts is off, you can configure that in the Options page (Click the extension icon -> Options -> Don't forget to save!).\nIf a short is automatically skipped, you can still scroll back up to watch it again if you want.\nIf you need to move history between devices, the Options page lets you export and import history files. \n\nFeel free to let me know if you have any improvements or feature requests you'd like to see!\nIf you like this plugin and would like to support me: https://ko-fi.com/rexthebuilder"
