This extension helps you in security and privacy by allowing you to encrypt your messages in Discord making sure that it's only you and the recipient(s) who ever read them!\nWorks from the browser or on your computer, without BetterDiscord.\n\nOnce you open discord you will get a window to create your local database, once that's done you can toggle encryption using the lock icon added to the channel's header and you can select the key used besides that. You can access the menu by right clicking the aforementioned lock icon. DM channels have different options than group channels.\nFor more information visit: https://gitlab.com/An0/SimpleDiscordCrypt\n\nIt is 100% open-source!\n\n(all your data is stored locally on your computer so make sure to use the export function for backups)"
