Registration and login is required to initiate call from user's mobile device. There is no need to type the number or key in the mobile. Also, user can setup to have hands free call, even when user's mobile is locked as well. You get a beep when the call is initiated from the mobile. If you have dual SIM card, you might have to select the SIM when call gets initiated after the beep sound(unlocking the phone is required)."
