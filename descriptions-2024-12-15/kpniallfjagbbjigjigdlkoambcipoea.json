With this extension, you can quickly block websites that you want to restrict access to.\n\nEasily add websites to your block list with just a few clicks. You can choose to block individual pages or entire domains, ensuring you're only browsing content that aligns with your goals. The extension also introduces a “strict mode” – a feature that allows to temporarily unblock chosen URLs, and automatically block them again after a certain period of time. The feature adds an additional restriction layer for people who require a more rigid control over their Internet surfing habits.\n\nOn Pace focuses on simplicity, which result in an ability to perform any operation in just a couple of clicks.\n\nTo start working with the extension, simply click on its icon in your browser or use Ctrl+Q keyboard shortcut."
