This fun extension is configurable with time (5 mins, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 minutes), sound alerts and speech alerts.  The alerts can be set at the beginning, at 5 minutes before ending, and at the ending.\n\n* Privacy/Permission: The browser history right is needed because of the \"Tabs\" permission which is needed to open new tabs by the extension's help/options page. No browsing information is saved locally or transmitted to remote locations.\n\nBackground: I created this a year+ ago for my own use after learning about the harmful effects of sitting for prolonged periods. Now (2017 June) publishing it on the Chrome Store as part of my portfolio. This is my highly configurable, fun and useful (hopefully) take on the traditional countdown timer. Enjoy!"
