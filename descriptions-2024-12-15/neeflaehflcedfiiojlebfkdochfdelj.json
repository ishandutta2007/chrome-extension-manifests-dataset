This extension records interactions with web pages that can then be replayed during scans. Recordings produced by this extension can be used for both Recorded Login and Recording Crawling.\n\nRECORDED LOGIN\nRecorded Login makes it possible to scan for vulnerabilities behind a login page. You can use the extension to record yourself logging in. Upload this recording to Detectify to include in scans.\n\nRECORDED CRAWLING\nRecorded Crawling captures a sequence of actions that will be recreated during Application Scanning. You can use the extension to record a specific flow of actions that Detectify’s crawler might otherwise miss, such as filling out complicated forms.\n\nNot sure if you need Detectify Recorder?
