They often screenshot the homepage, go in Photoshop and make the job themselves. This extension just requires you to upload your artwork, type your artist name, type the track title and you're done!\n\nFeatures:\n- Placing your artwork randomly on the Spotify homepage\n- Dark mode\n- Doesn't require you to login or give any credentials\n- Remembering your last submission\n\nThis extension was originally created by Benjamin Code to preview YouTube video thumbnails. It has been developed by him during a live stream on Twitch and designed by BastiUI. This Spotify version has been developed by lunath.\nThis is an open source extension so you can go on the repository of the extension and contribute or ask for new features. Lot of different contributors developed good features for the project.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/lunath__\nhttp://twitter.com/benjamincode\nhttp://twitter.com/bastiui"
