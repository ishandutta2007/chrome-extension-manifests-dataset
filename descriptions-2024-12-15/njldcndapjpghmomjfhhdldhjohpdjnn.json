By automatically bolding the first half of every word on a webpage, Cyborg-Reader capitalizes on the brain's ability to fill in the rest, letting you read faster without sacrificing understanding.\n\nOur brains are incredibly good at pattern recognition and prediction. By highlighting the initial part of a word, Cyborg-Reader leverages this capability, helping you to anticipate the remainder of the word more rapidly. This not only increases reading speed but also retains — or even enhances — comprehension.\n\nWhether you're a student looking to power through study materials, a professional who wants to speed through reports, or a casual browser seeking to maximize your online reading, Cyborg-Reader can help you achieve your goals.\n\nExperience the future of speed-reading with Cyborg-Reader!"
