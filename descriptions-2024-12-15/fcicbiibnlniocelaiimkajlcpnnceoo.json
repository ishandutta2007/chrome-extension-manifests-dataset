So you probably already how to design in System Designer even if you have never run it.\n\nThe definition of the model is stored on a human readable format called MSON. With MSON you can define types, classes, one to one / one to many relationships and multi inheritance between classes.\n\nCODE THE BEHAVIOR OF YOUR SYSTEM\n\nOnce you have created your model, System Designer generates the skeletons of all your methods. You only have then to add your code to implement them.\n\nSystem Designer provides you helpers to manage your components. You can easily navigate threw components to create your system.\n\nCREATE COMPONENTS GRAPHICALLY\n\nThere is no need to code to instantiate a component. Create a component in System Designer is like creating a document in a NoSQL Database.\n\nIn fact, System Designer acts as an ODM (Object-Document Mapper) to manage your components as NoSQL Documents.\n\nRUN YOUR SYSTEM\n\nYou can run your system directly from System Designer and then export it to HTML, JSON, JavaScript, a Node.js module or a Graphviz file.\n\nBecause you have defined a model for your system, a Dynamic Type Check is done on every action of your system. All warnings are send and shown in System Designer.\n\nDEBUG YOUR SYSTEM\n\nSystem Designer can load the model of any system that runs on the browser or on Node.js. You can see the schemas, models, components and methods of the running system and you can edit them.\n\nAll modifications to the model done inside System Designer will be send to the running system. There is no need to reload to see your modifications.\n\nDESIGN ON THE GO\n\nSystem Designer can be used on Windows 10, macOS, Linux, iPad, Android or any browsers. You can also install it in your project: System Designer requires no backend to work, it is a full web application.\n\nSystem Designer has a Github module to synchronize your work between all these apps. You can begin your design on your Mac and then continue it on your iPad."
