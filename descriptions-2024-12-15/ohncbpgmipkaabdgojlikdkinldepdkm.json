The seek API is unfortunately only allowed for Spotify Premium.\n- This extension is only supported on Chrome. It has been tested on Windows and OSX desktops. It has not been tested on *nix platforms.\n- The extension client authorization only lasts 1hour. After every hour, the user will need to allow the extension access to its Spotify account again. This is a current limitation with Spotify's front-end client authorization flow.\n- The maximum number of tracks with loop ranges have not been tested. The fixed chrome extension storage limits are 5MB.\n\nSupport\nPost your bug reports and ideas to https://github.com/abdulazizali77/sloooop/issues\n\nChange Log\n0.0.1 - Initial Release\n0.0.2 - Fixed changed component references"
