You may be interested in preventing their websites from receiving your traffic, for various reasons.\n\n== Instructions ==\n\nPin the extension to the browser \nClick the action icon to open the popup\nUse the checkbox to enable or disable the WixBlock extension.\n\n\n== New Feature ==\nThe extension now counts the number of times a domain has been blocked. We keep track of the number of global blocks and display the count on the block screen.\nThe extension tracks no data, not IP, not anything.\n\n* This is a beta feature.\n\n== The Future ==\n\nI expect to make more use of the popup and add more features.\n\nThe next step will be to publish the count of top blocked sites once the feature is bedded in.\n\n== Suggestions ==\n\nIf there is something you'd like to see from the extension, get in touch via email."
