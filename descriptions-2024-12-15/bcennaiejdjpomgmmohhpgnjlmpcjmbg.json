Now with delete function you can easily delete any pages you want whenever you want =)\n\nThis thing acts like a mini-history manager, enable Save closed tabs feature and it'll save up those closed tabs ! Want to get back that tab you opened last month? No problem ! It'll still be there !\n\nVersion History\n\nUpdate v7.4.x: \nRemembering tabs after browser crash. \nDouble-clicking the icon works again. \nFixed Ctrl+Z conflict for Polish users. \nOS X blank popup bug fixed.\n\nUpdate v7.2.x: \nOrdering fixed. \nWorks with pre-rendered tabs.\n\nUpdate v7.1.0: \nMultiple Tab Issue Is Fixed.\n\nUpdate v7.0.6 :\nRemoved all the fancy useless animated effects in the options page \nand fixed some lame bugs =)\n\nUpdate v7 :\n- Auto-clearing, no need to worry about clearing everyday anymore, the app will delete the oldest closed tab from the memory !\n- Another attempt at Ctrl+Z on Mac fix ( NEED CONFIRMATION )\n- Improved and re-optimized the whole code, thus increasing the overall performance\n- Option to disable the double click feature\n- Less messy option names ( e.g. instead of 'hide' it is now 'show' )\n- A whole new redesigned options page ( did this out of boredom )\n- Fixed the badge bug where it wouldn't show number of tabs when Chrome is opened.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy small TODO list , well you know, stuff that will be done later:\n- Custom undo shortcut option\n- A better way of reopening last closed tab\n- Clear can sometimes mess up some stuff\n- Bigger font size option"
