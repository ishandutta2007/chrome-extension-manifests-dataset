We get it, meetings can be a drag. So we created an extension to do something about it. Share this with those co-workers who schedule meetings a little too much so they have to think twice before sending back-to-back invites.\n\nThe scheduler is prompted with a pop-up before sending an invite that poses questions including, “Are you sure this meeting is necessary?” Because we all know there are better ways to go about our workday. \n\n+Compatible with Google Chrome and Google Calendar.\n+Prompts you before scheduling an event. Makes you ask yourself “Is this necessary?”\n+Gives a different illustrated reason every time. Occasionally thought-provoking."
