With a single\naction, users can bulk file individual emails and conversations with their\ndocument attachments. A visual cue indicates that filing is complete. \n\nManaging attachments is a breeze with iManage Work Gmail integration.\nDocuments within the iManage Work project folder-, can be attached directly\nto outgoing emails as an HTTP link or an attachment copy. You can preview\ndocument attachments and be alerted if they are sending an outdated copy,\neliminating any risks associated with sharing the wrong version. Inbound\nattachments can be detached from the source email and filed as new\ndocuments or new versions of existing documents within the respective project.\nYou can file multiple emails with multiple attachments as a single operation\nusing iManage Work Email Management for Gmail. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou need to have an appropriate iManage Work license to use the iManage Work Email Management for Gmail. Please contact your iManage Account Executive if you need further information. \n\nThe iManage Email Management for Gmail extension uses the Inbox SDK from Streak to interact with Gmail. The Inbox SDK continuously monitors changes to the Gmail DOM and User Interface elements and updates itself automatically in real-time. This ensures the iManage Email Management for Gmail extension continues to work even when Gmail is updated without any notice. \n \nThe Inbox SDK loads required components directly from within the iManage Email Management for Gmail extension from Streak servers, which means that the extension needs to have access to the Internet. When communicating with the Streak servers, no user or company specific data, such as emails, contacts or personal information, is shared with the Inbox SDK or the Streak servers. \n \nThe terms and conditions related to the use of the InboxSDK are set forth at https://www.inboxsdk.com/terms.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
