I don't need this.\nÔº°: Young teens may be twice as sensitive to light at night, and the elderly much less so. These results have important implications for schools, senior care, and device usage at night, too. Simply put: everyone has a use for this and will notice benefits from decreased blue light.\n\nÔº±: Why not G.lux or Night Light?\nÔº°: Other extensions like G.Lux or Night Light just change your display's color. Screen Shader is the only extension available that smartly changes the color of your screen throughout the day using sunset/sunrise times! Research has proven that the circadian rhythm is tied to solar time. Individuals have shown greater preference for screen tinting applications that take that into account.\n\nÔº±: Does this really remove blue light from my display?\nÔº°: Yup! Screens work by individually tweaking the amount of red, green, and blue each pixel of your emits.  Pixels being the small square of colors that together form the image. Screen Shader alters the coloration of websites to a redder color.  To show these colors, the display will tweak its pixels to show more red light, less green light, and considerably less blue light; but just enough so you can still see different colors.  The more you increase the shade, the more the color of the website will be reddened, the less your computer display will emit blue light!\n\nÔº±: Why do I need this?  Can‚Äôt I simply change my screen's brightness?\nÔº°: Changing the luminosity does not remove white and blue light from your display. Those colors are still unnatural and will irritate your eyes, even if dimmed. A full day in front of your computer can wreak havoc upon your melatonin cycle and internal clock. The unnatural light can also harm your eye retina.  Screen Shader is designed to considerably reduce these effects by eliminating enough white and blue light to provide you with the best browsing experience and eye comfort.\n\nUpdate log:\n2.1:\n    Update to manifest v3\n    General optimizations\n    Many more site fixes\n    Add shade fullscreen (making it optional)\n\n2.0:\n    Everything is coded from scratch!\n    New menu - very nice\n    Fixes bugs on countless websites\n    New shading algorithm\n    Manually set your location\n    Better optimized shading engine\n    Just try it out!\n\n1.7:\n    Fixes for pages using buggy backdrops and backgrounds.\n    Big speed optimization for bug fixing subsystem.\n    Fixed bug with 10px bar at the top of websites\n    Force-loads itself on every tab when it loads up, so every tab is tinted :)\n    Can safely work in incognito mode (if you enable it to do so on chrome://extensions)\n    The party easter egg was unfortunately removed because too many people were running into it accidentally\n    Fixed issues on xml documents\n    Fixed issues with lastpass extension\n    Fixed scrollbar issues in upcoming chrome versions\n    Now works with podStation Podcast Player, another great extension you should totally try out!\n    Fixed incompatibility issues with norton security extensions.\n    Save extension settings to a file and load settings from save file.\n    Added new shortcuts\n    Fixed a bunch of visual bugs on a variety of websites.\n    Other various bug fixes.\n    \n1.6:\n    Works on anything fullscreen!\n    Content scripts have been rewritten to pure js.
