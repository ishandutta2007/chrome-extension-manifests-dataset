The 10 first albums as sorted in Flickr Organizer are shown in this column.\n\n2) Direct tag-links to same photographer's photos.\n\nWhen hovering the mouse over a photo-tag, Flick Fixr adds an extra link in tags, pointing to the same photographer's similar tagged photos.\n\n3) Links to album-map and album-comments.\n\nAdds two extra links in \"album headers\". One link pointing to a map with current album's photos, and another link pointing to the old hidden/forgotten page with album comments, which also is a great page for reading long album descriptions.\n\n4) Highlight geotagged photo on associated map + Google Maps link.\n\nMakes sure geoposition of photo is highlighted when following link to Flickr Map from a geotagged photo. Plus, on the photopage for a geotagged photo, also adds a link to show geoposition of photo directly on Google Maps.\n\n5) Top-pagination for fast an easy navigation.\n\nAre you annoyed by having to scroll to the bottom of photostreams for pagination? Flickr Fixr adds a pagination-bar above the streams for fast and easy navigation. But because the pager-bar sometimes gets pretty wide and might overlap other icons or dropdowns also placed right above the photostream, the top-pager is hidden until you hover your mouse over the center-area right above the photostream. The top-pager is available on photostreams, albumpages, favorite collections, group pools and on the Explore page.\n\n6) Explore Calendar and Recent Uploads.\n\nOn the Explore page, Flickr Fixr adds a link to the hidden/forgotten Explore Calendar and to a page showing some of the latest uploads to Flickr. A little warning regarding the latest uploads though; Even though Safe Search is activated on that page, you risk seeing stuff you might have preferred not to see.\n\n7) Extra top menu items.\n\nAdds Tags, Collections and Map items to both the user (\"You\" dropdown) and the photographer menus (menu bar).\n\n8)  Better date &amp; time info on photopages\n\nEmphasis of Taken Date instead of Upload Date. Adding Replaced Date when it is  detected. And full timestamp on Taken and Upload dates also available via mouseover.\n\n9) Show available newsfeeds.\n\nWhen a newsfeed is detected on a page, an orange feed-icon is added as link to this. The feed-icons are added in upper right corner of pages. Works both on pages on the main flickr.com site and on the blogs on blog.flickr.net and code.flickr.net.\n\n10) Set speed of slideshows\n\nVia Flickr Fixr's Options page you can set the number of seconds each image are to be shown when running a slideshow on Flickr. Flickr's (normally fixed) duration is 5 seconds pr. image, but Flickr Fixr allow you to set duration to any number between 1 and 60 seconds pr. image.\n\nMore info about Flickr Fixr in the Flickr Hacks forum:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157655601688753/\n\nHave an awesome time on Flickr :-)\n\n\n/Stig\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/stignygaard/"
