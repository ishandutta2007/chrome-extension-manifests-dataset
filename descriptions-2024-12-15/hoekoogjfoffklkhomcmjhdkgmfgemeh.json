The UI will display all of the uploaded items. You may now use the - Zip & Download - button to download the ZIP file to your computer (default download location). A reload symbol is located at the top-right corner of the app's UI. When you click on this symbol, the program is refreshed and all current operations are reset. To zip multiple files, simply drop them into one folder on your computer (top section). It is also suggested that you reload the application after each zipping operation.\n\nNote 1: This plugin isn't meant to work with multiple types of files. It's only designed to compress zip files.\n\nNote 2: This add-on uses an open-source JavaScript library for the zip operation. You may learn more about this library at https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js"
