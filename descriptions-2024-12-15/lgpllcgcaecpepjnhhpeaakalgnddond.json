This is useful when you sign up for any website that requires you to use an email address.\n\nWith a unique email address, you can sign up to the website and track the usage of your email address. For example, if the website has a data breach and your email is exposed to the public, suddenly your inbox full of spam and marketing emails. With Tempe, you can easily create a filter to target a specific email address and block it (Skip Inbox / Delete or Mark as Spam)."
