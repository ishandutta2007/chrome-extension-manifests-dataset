Normally, if you want to upload an image (or other file) from a URL, you first have to download it to your computer, then upload it, and then delete it from your computer. \nWith this extension, all you have to do is enter the URL of the file, and the extension will automatically upload it into the page for you.\n\nThe extension can now also upload an image directly from your clipboard. Just paste the image in the extension's popup using ctrl+v, and the image will be loaded into the page.\n\nYou can use this extension to post an image on Facebook or Twitter, upload files to your Cloud storage or anywhere else you upload files.\n\nThis is not a good tool for uploading large files. It first reads the entire file into your computer's RAM, and then uploads it into the page. Especially video files will just be too large for it to handle. This is meant more so for images and small files.\n\nChrome hides extensions by default after you install them. If the extension icon \"disappeared\", go to extensions menu by clicking on the puzzle icon in your extensions toolbar, and then pin this extension to the toolbar. You can also use this extension with the Ctrl + Shift + U key combination, even when it's not in the 'pinned' state.\n\nCredits\nIcons sourced from www.flaticon.com"
