These cookies are automatically sent in every request to the domain that set them. This allows a simple way to track each clientâ€™s server association for load balancing control.\n\nThis extension reverse the F5 algorithm used to encode the data, and exposes the IP address and TCP port of the host that is actually handling your connection. \n\nIt was made to help administrators in trobleshooting situations. \n\nNote that non encrypted cookies are considered a security issue, and this extension will not work if your load balancer was configured to use the non reversible crypto."
