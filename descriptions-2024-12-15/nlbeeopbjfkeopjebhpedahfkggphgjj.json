Minimal impact on performance.\n\nDO IT THE EZ WAY\nThis extension uses the LEAST amount of scripts and permissions to do its intended function. In fact, it does not even require any special permissions at all.\n\nNOT DEPENDENT ON 3RD-PARTY RESOURCES\nExtensions that block ads often depend heavily on externally-hosted lists. EZ-Adhider does not depend on any sources outside of itself. \n\nRUNS ON ALL SITES\nEZ-Adhider will run on all sites. Please do expect that you will occasionally encounter unintended effects in a site's functionality or missing site elements. If this happens, you can disable EZ-Adhider by going to Manage Extensions -> Toggling off Chrome's built-in switch. This extension (by design) does not have any additional settings or controls to keep it as simple as possible.\n\nWORKS MOST OF THE TIME\nUsing other extensions may trigger sites to wall their content. EZ-Adhider works most of the time without the annoyance of these triggers. It does not prevent any network requests (for a variety of reasons). Instead, by taking the \"hiding approach\", it turns out that this method offers a more seamless experience for site loading.\n\nA GOOD-FAITH APPROACH\nEZ-Adhider does not interfere with a site's DOM rendering in any way, nor does it modify any scripts of a site whatsoever. It merely hides ad elements by applying additional styles in the same way that accessibility tools do. Note that you are already free to change styles on a site, even without any extensions at all."
