The encryption is as simple as a keyboard shortcut, and the decryption is seamless.  Grd Me currently supports AES and ECC for both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.\n\nGrd Me is designed with openness and decentralization at its core. Therefore we have published all the source code and designed it in such a way that for its core functionality you don't have to trust anything at all. For the full feature-set you need only trust our servers to be available (they can be otherwise completely compromised and the system will still remain secure and private)."
