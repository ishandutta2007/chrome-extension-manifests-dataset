Stories are now even more visible than before. For those who don't use this feature, like us, this chrome extension removes them entirely from top of the news feed.\n\n+ Is this extension secure?\n\nYes, this tiny extension only checks whether stories are visible and hides them entirely. Nothing else on the page is read.\n\n+ How can I remove my stories?\n\nSimply install this Chrome extension and reload all your facebook tabs.\n\nHope you enjoy, and let us know if this doesn't work for you. Happy facebooking!"
