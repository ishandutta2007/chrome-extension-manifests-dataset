The Sponsor (a marketplace or a large supermarket chain) will adopt Re-Taled as a technological solution and empower the Community to establish a reliable and trustworthy content exchange system. Moreover, the Sponsor is expected to integrate its e-commerce and loyalty program services with the Re-Taled platform in order to allow the Community to use TALE tokens for discounts or in exchange for prizes. On the other hand, the Community is an autonomous entity (made of content creators, influencers and consumers) which creates and oversees content, services, new influencersâ€™ approval, dispute settlements and quality assurance."
