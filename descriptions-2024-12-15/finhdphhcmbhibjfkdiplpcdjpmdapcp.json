The average score is calculated from image views and votes and represents how many points each photo got per one view. The average score is accumulative: the calculation includes votes and views from all challenges in which this photo has participated.\n\nThe scores can be seen at gallery pages (user profiles, challenge winners). \n\nPlease note that scores of very old images might be not precise, as the information of their views is not always full."
