The APPROVE for Equipment Vendors Chrome Extension makes it incredibly easy for equipment sellers to create digital finance applications directly from web-based quoting tools like Salesforce and Quickbooks, or website ecommerce product pages. \n\nUsers can copy and paste product, model and sell price information into the application builder in seconds. The tool uses the product sell price to calculate an estimated monthly finance payment and automatically create a prepopulated application ready for customers to complete. A link to the application is instantly generated and can be pasted and shared with customers in quotes, emails, texts or anywhere a link can be pasted.\n\nThis extension is a highly effective sales tool for equipment vendors that understand the value of proactively presenting financing options to their customers and appreciate inefficient method of proving finance applications without logging into other systems."
