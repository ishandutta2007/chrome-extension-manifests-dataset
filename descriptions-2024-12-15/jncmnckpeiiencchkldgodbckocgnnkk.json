(github.com/onursert/readark)\nThe add-on consists of a small screen that allows you to control those preferences. The first switch called \"Reading Mode\" and provides you to turn the colors of your browser content to warmer. Second switch called \"Dark (Night) Mode\" and provides you to change the colors of your browser content to darker.\nTurning on reading mode protect your eyes from reading for hours. Hence you can easily continue to read EPUBs or e-books much longer. Turning on dark mode protects your eyes from bright colors. Social networks, mainstream sites, and all other new tabs will be in dark mode with ReaDark. No needs to open every website settings one by one - just one add-on makes every website in dark mode.\nChrome Browser policies restrict ReaDark to work on the Chrome Web Store and Home Page."
