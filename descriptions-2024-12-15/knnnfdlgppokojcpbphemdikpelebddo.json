If you're not comfortable to watch a video - just press the extension on your browser and receive a new tab with headline, text and screenshots from the video. You will not miss anything because the article comes with the text and images from the video.\n\nYou can also pick a language you would like to read the article: on the new tab with text and images there is a side menu where you can choose a language. Available languages depend on the available subtitles in the original video.\n\nEnjoy reading videos!\n\nNOTE: If the conversion do not work from the first time - reload the page and press again on the extension button (we will fix this in the next version).\n\nNew feature added - switch on and off the screenshots\nNew feature - save as PDF"
