Inspired by Neovim’s keybindings, it allows you to use custom shorthands instead of using your mouse to access bookmarks which has an additional overload of organizing them. \n\nSimply type a pre-defined shorthand to quickly load most frequent websites you access. Activate the extension by pressing ; and space, then enter your shorthand to open the link. Streamline your browsing and stay focused on your keyboard with Turbomarks.\n\nTo add a new turbomark, click on the extension popup in the extensions bar of Firefox, enter your shorthand and the URL you want to map to it. Click \"Store\". As simple as that!\n\nPair this extension with Vimium to fully unlock the bliss of (almost) entirely using the keyboard to navigate the browser. Personally, when I'm browsing and now i want to go back to reading the study article I had been reading, I use Ctrl+t (opens a new tab, default browser keybind), type in turbomarks activation (; then Space), type in \"study\" and enter! Voila. There's my study material in an instant."
