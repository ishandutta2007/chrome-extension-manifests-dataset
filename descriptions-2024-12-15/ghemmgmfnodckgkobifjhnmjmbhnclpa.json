To address this problem, I wrote this little Chrome script called Netflix Notes.\n\nNetflix Notes changes your Netflix queue so that you can add a private “note to self” on each movie in your queue. The main point of this is to remind yourself why you added a particular movie – e.g. because a friend recommended it, you read a good review, and so on.\n\nConveniently, the notes you enter are synchronized across all your computers, as long as you are logged into Chrome.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Can other people see my notes?\nA: Your notes are only visible on any computer on which you \"log into\" Chrome.  So for example, if you have one computer at home and one at work, and you log into the same Chrome account on both, then you can see the same set of notes on both; and anyone else who sits down at one of those computers can see the notes.\n\nQ: Where, exactly, are the notes stored? \nA: They are stored in what Google calls \"Chrome Storage,\" which is part of your user profile. E.g. on a Mac, the local copy is usually under ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default. Chrome also copies the data up to Google's servers, so that it can be synchronized across all your computers.  See http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage.html for technical details."
