Sometimes it's hard to know what to price your items at, so researching what similar ones have sold for is really beneficial and helpful!\" - The Gilded Lion\n\n**Latest Updates**\n* Updated support for non-US locales, now prices don't N/A but sometimes aren't localized (so partial improvement)\n* Always logs found price in the event page structure prevents display\n* Expanded URLs to include non-US stores (e.g. dk-en/listing)\n* Added new feature for viewing a store's sold page. Now when viewing a sold archive for a store, prices will attempt to load automatically on the individual tiles and then sum the sold prices for the current page's results in the header.\n* Updated to support two types of sold-store page document structures."
