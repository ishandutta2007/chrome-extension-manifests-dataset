To work with this add-on, simply click on the toolbar icon to activate the add-on. Then, select any desired element with mouse left-click. Please note that, as you move your mouse, elements are highlighted with pink color. Once you select an element, a popup window will appear that contains a loader image. Once the operation is done, the loader will be replaced with the screenshot. Now you can download the image to your machine by clicking on the download button.\n\nIf you want to close the screenshot's popup window, please click on the close button on the top left corner. Please note that, by default, the extension does not include cross-domain images in the screenshot, if you want to enable this feature, please visit the options page and click on the - allow cors - checkmark. You can also adjust the screenshot resolution. By default, it is set to 2, meaning the screenshot image is two times bigger than the original element.\n\nIf you have a feature request in mind or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form in the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/html-elements-screenshot.html)."
