Just hit the PathFactory logo while you’re composing an email, and embed a tile or link in your draft.\n\nMarketers can curate streams of content for various personas, industries, and use cases that help Sales reps deliver a compelling content journey every time.\n\nSharing bingeable Content Tracks (as opposed to single assets) helps educate prospects quicker, leading to more qualified leads and shorter sales cycles.\n\nThe PathFactory platform puts Sales and Marketing on the same page by surfacing one unified content consumption data set—whether that content was sent out by the Sales or Marketing. This makes it extremely clear to both Sales and Marketing which people and accounts are the most ready to buy."
