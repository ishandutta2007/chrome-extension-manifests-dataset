You can also manually force the ad skipping by clicking on the extension icon. This is totally transparent to YouTube, that doesn't detect the use of the extension.\n\nThe story behind:\nTime ago I created an advertising campaign in order to advertise my software, a tool for extending the desktop UI. But at first they suspended my account because \"I was speculating about the war\" (which makes no sense), then because I was suspicious for them. I sent them several emails to try to solve to resolve the misunderstanding, but the only reply I received was \"Google is a private company and can decide who wants as a customer and not without any explanation. Nothing personal.\"\n\nWhen YouTube decided I have no right to use my adblocker on their website I thought \"I'm a private person and the computer is my property. And I decide what to see and what don't. Nothing personal.\" Or, better yet, Nothing PersonADS. \n\nHave a good entertainment without interruptions!"
