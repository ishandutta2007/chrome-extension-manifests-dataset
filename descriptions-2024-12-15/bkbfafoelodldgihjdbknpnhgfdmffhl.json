Boost your productivity tenfold with this browser extension. It will completely remove your News Feed or replace it with an inspirational quote so you can finally get to that work you were meaning to do \"tomorrow.\" \n\nYou can still check your messages and notifications, post status updates, chat and do everything you could do before. Although now you won't get distracting News Feed posts that send you into a downward spiral of lurking your ex-girlfriend's  vacation pictures.\n\nIf the 100+ inspirational quotes aren't your thing you can personalize the message to anything you like. You can also set which days of the  week you want to block the News Feed as well as what time of day just in case you are in need of some weekend indulgences. \n\nI want to give credit to JDev who wrote the original code for this extension and allowed anyone to use it and improve on it. Thanks! Please check him out at west.io"
