It’s gotten so bad that it’s like a virus, infecting your vocabulary. What used to be cool, is now “on point” or “fire”, and there’s no correct punctuation at the end of sentence any more—it’s an army of exclamation marks and emojis—and what’s with the damn eggplant?\n\nIt’s time to take a stand! We need to re-educate ourselves and learn how a true action hero talks. Only one man can bear the weight of that challenge—Dolph Lundgren.\n\nHe’s been hard at work with the globe’s top linguists (probably) on the new “action hero” plugin—Trendstopper—to protect you from the onslaught of hipster slang by replacing it with proper words, 100% approved by Dolph!"
