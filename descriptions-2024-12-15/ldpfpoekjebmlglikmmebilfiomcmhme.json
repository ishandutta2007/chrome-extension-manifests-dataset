Once I know how to solve this, I will restrict it further.\n\nHowever the source code is open source so feel free to browse it if you are concerned.\n\nThe info the extension needs is as follows:\n\nUsername - username to CloudShell\nPassword - password to CloudShell\nDomain - the domain within CloudShell that you want to show active sandboxes in\nAPI URI - the CloudShell REST API endpoint (get this from your administrator) - no trailing slash but starts with http:// or https://\nPortal URI - the address of your CloudShell portal you log into - no trailing slash but starts with http:// or https://"
