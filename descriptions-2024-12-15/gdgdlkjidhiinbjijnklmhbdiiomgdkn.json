As you play a game of online chess on lichess.com, this chrome extension will follow the moves of the game, and in real-time, play chords and notes that I recorded to reflect the mood of each individual move. The code that I wrote to create this applet can be found at this link: https://github.com/AlexMedoff/ChromeExtensionChessSound\n\nPlease understand that this is the first build of the applet, so there are definitely some bugs and some ways the app can be improved upon. Enjoy!\n\nThanks,\nAlex Medoff"
