Ideal for reading, browsing, and playing along to music.\nClick the extension icon to activate the extension and open the UI menu.\n\nThree modes:\n1. Fixed-speed smooth scroll: Automatic scrolling at a precise speed from user input and/or directional buttons.\n2. Periodic scroll: Set the page to scroll a specific amount every given number of seconds; perfect for hands-off reading.\n3. Timed waypoints: Enter a scroll duration and choose a point on the page (or the top or bottom) to have the page scroll and arrive at that point after the given amount of time; perfect for playing along to guitar tabs and sheet music.\n\nSave/Load:\nIf you've found the perfect scroll speed for a page, you can save it and load it again whenever you visit the same URL.\n\nHotkeys (activated by opening UI panel; focus must be on webpage):\nSpace - Pause/Resume\nBackspace - Stop\nArrow Keys - Increment Speed\n\n\nFeedback and bug reports are welcome!\nGet in touch via the Chrome Web Store or email rhuost@gmail.com."
