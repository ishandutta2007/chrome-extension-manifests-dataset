You have to download the subtitles online before you can use them in the extension. There are many websites that offer free subtitles. Two of the most popular ones are opensubtitles.org and yts-subs.com. Once youâ€™ve got the subtitles you're good to go!\n\nMovie Subtitles was originally developed to facilitate language learning and comes with many useful features for that purpose, such as the ability to jump between dialogues, skip silence and many more!\n\nFeatures:\n- Skip silence (scenes between dialogues)\n- Skip music (if supported by the subtitle file)\n- Synchronize subtitles\n- Adjust subtitle style\n- Select/Copy subtitle text (in edit mode)\n- Upload subtitles in 40+ languages\n- Supported formats (.txt, .srt, .sub)\n- Shortcuts (not on Netflix)\n\nShortcuts:\n- Previous sentence\n- Next sentence\n- Rewind (2.5 or 5s)\n- Fast-forward (2.5 or 5s)\n- Speed (slower)\n- Speed (faster)\n- Subtitles on/off\n- Sync subtitles (1s earlier)\n- Sync subtitles (1s later)\n\nMovie Subtitles is an open-source project. If you have any ideas for improvement, found a bug, or want to contribute in some other way, you're welcome to do so!\nhttps://github.com/gignupg/Movie-Subtitles\n\nIf you want to use Movie Subtitles to skip certain scenes of a movie, such as violent scenes, sexual scenes etc. check out the article on Medium I wrote about this topic: https://gignu.medium.com/how-to-skip-violent-scenes-and-adult-content-in-movies-3c7d89b813ad\n\nCredits:\n- Logo inspired by icons8\nhttps://icons8.com/icons/set/movie-theater\n\n- The extension was built using Ixieyang's React Boilerplate\nhttps://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react\n\n- Screenshots from Big Buck Bunny\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ\n\nLicense:\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License"
