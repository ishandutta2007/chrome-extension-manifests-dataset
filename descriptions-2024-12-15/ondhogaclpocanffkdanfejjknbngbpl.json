So they want to see the source of the sentence, which is the reference paper. On arxiv.org, when people need to read the reference paper. They need to click on the citation internal link annotation, which leads the users to the citation section. They need to copy and paste the citation to google scholar web page and then they could find their paper. When they come back to the original paper, they still need to scroll all the way up to where they were. So this extension reduce the time of looking for the reference paper and improve the efficiency of reading paper, mainly on two parts:\n1. time to copy and paste the citation information to google scholar\n2. time to scroll back to the place of the citation internal link annotation."
