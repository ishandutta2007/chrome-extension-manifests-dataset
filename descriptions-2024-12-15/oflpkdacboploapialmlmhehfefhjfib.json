Enter a five letter word in the box, but don't let your friend see! Then, click submit and let your friend guess the word. If the letter is grey, it means that it is not in the word. If the letter is yellow, it means that it is in the word but it is not in that place. If the letter is green, it means that it is in the word and is in the right place. \nBased on Wordle."
