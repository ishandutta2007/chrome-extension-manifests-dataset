This extension will help you with niche & keyword research for Amazon FBA, KDP and Merch by Amazon.\n\nTOP EXTENSION BAR DATA FEATURES:\n* Average Amazon BSR (Best Seller Rank)\n* Average BSR calculation\n* Average price calculation\n* Average reviews calculation\n* Keyword / Niche Score calculation \n* Download data option\n\nSINGLE PRODUCT BOX DATA FEATURES:\n* Main BSR & Sub BSR\n* Type of Book\n* Page count\n* Book size\n* Publish date\n\nYou can simply click the download button, and it will create an excel file with all ASINs, Author/Seller names and all Titles for every product on the home page. You can use this for research and best of all for ads creations to target all the best sellers directly as a product campaign, a keyword campaign targeting their author name as well as the book title.\n\nThis keyword niche score is an algorithm that I have been perfecting over the last year and use daily for research. It is recommend finding niches with a score of 62% and higher. This algorithm takes into account all listings on the first page and goes through how many exact product results there are, how many results on the first page, what all the prices are and the average,  what the reviews are and the average, what all individual BSR are and the average and then uses all the data combined into a very thorough algorithm to determine how easy it will be to compete and rank on page 1 and what keywords to use for ads to get the best traction in rankings.\n\nYou can't simply rely on just how many results and some BSR data. What is the results and BSR is good, but every book on page 1 has a TON of reviews, or MOST books have some low price that you can't really compete with, especially with no reviews and no ads... The algorithm takes everything into consideration. \n\nImagine how much easier publishing book with Kindle Direct Publishing can become. No more guess work on Amazon search pages, no more time consuming copy & pasting, no more endless calculations. \n\nI hope this brings you lots of ease and success with your KDP Amazon journey. \n\nHappy Selling from Self Publishing Titans"
