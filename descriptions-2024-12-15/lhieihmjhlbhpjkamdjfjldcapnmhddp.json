Because of this, the extension might ask you for more permissions. \n\n---\n\nI love Stack Overflow. But the sidebars can get annoying, especially the Meta and the Hiring ones. Plus, many a hour have I wasted browsing through \"Hot Network Questions\" because I saw some interesting post on English Stack Exchange. And oh my god the Chat thing is so useless. \n\nThis extension cleans all that up. I wanted to keep the Related and Linked questions though - that stuff's useful. \n\nThe screenshots show a Before and After view of the same Stack Overflow question.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/ShivanKaul/sidebaroverflow"
