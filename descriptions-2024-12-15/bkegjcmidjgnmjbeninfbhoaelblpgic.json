The addon will remain available for download as long as the store allows, and the source on gitlab (https://gitlab.com/Marnes-group/webextensions) will also remain available to fork.\n**I do have a greasyfork account (https://greasyfork.org/en/users/18593-marnes) and may publish works there in the future.** I have mild intentions to reimplement the core functionality of CSL, IBCP, and DID as public userscripts.\n\nAlso available for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/plain-text-linker/\n\nWhen you double-click on a piece of plain text, Plain Text Linker tries to determine if what you clicked could be a URL and tries to open it.\n\nPlease check the linked homepage for more complete information. Issues can be filed on the linked support site."
