This is bad for everyone. From getting ghosted, to spam calls and texts, to recruiters who just have no idea what they're talking about or worse, what we go through when looking for work seems to be getting worse year after year.\n\nWe believe the first steps in fixing how hiring is done is to hold recruiters accountable for the reputations they deserve.\n\nHireRank exists to make things better for candidates. Your data will never be shared with or sold to anyone. Reviews contribute to an overall score (the HireRank, get it?) for each staffing professional, and you can rest assured that the details of your feedback will always stay confidential."
