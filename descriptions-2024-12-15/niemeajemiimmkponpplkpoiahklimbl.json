Or have a 1 on 1 and been given constructive feedback you'd like to gently be reminded of? This Chrome extension gives push notifications on an time interval which you set for randomly selected reminders which you are quickly able to add. This is perfect for those of us who work on a computer with Google Chrome open all day.\n\nTo start, set a time interval for which you'd like to be reminded. The default is once per hour. Then, add as many reminders in the text fields as you'd like. Close the extension, and begin working on a better version of you."
