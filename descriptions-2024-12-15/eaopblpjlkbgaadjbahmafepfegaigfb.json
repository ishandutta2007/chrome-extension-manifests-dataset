That means that if you will be forced to see the video the way YouTube wants you to: With advertisements and suggested videos on all sides around the video space, and even in the actual video space before and after the video plays!\n\nNow you can watch the same exact video, just in a cleaner atmosphere. On 613Tube. Just take any YouTube link and replace the \"You\" with \"613\" and you will get the same video, and JUST that video!\n\nOr let's say you need to search for a specific YouTube video. Before you even have a chance to type in what you want to search for, YouTube already stuffed your face with what they recommend you watch. Now you can search all YouTube videos from 613Tube and only see what you want to see. 613Tube uses YouTube's search engine, with SafeSearch automatically enabled.\n\nWith this extension,\n\nAll YouTube links will automatically redirect to 613Tube. You can now confidently click on any YouTube link knowing that you will watch that video in a good atmosphere.\nAdditionally, even YouTube videos which are embeded into other websites will be modified to not display \"Related Videos\" when the video finishes playing."
