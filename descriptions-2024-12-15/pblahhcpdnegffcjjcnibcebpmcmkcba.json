Can I get an appointment?\" Pull up the Temple Scheduler app (https://temple-online-scheduling.churchofjesuschrist.org/) and choose your temple. Let's say Provo City Center temple. \"Are there appointments here?\" Click 4 or 7 buttons to pick your chosen proxy ordinance, group count, and eventually date. Nope, the calendar is full. Let's switch to the Orem temple. Another 4 to 7 clicks, and that temple is full that day too. How about Mt. Timpanogos? Yep, full too. Draper? Payson? Jordan River? A half hour later I'm exhausted, and I still haven't found a spot. \"Can I just search across temples for available appointments?\"\n\nSolution\n\nAfter installing this extension\n\n1. Go to the Temple Scheduler app (https://temple-online-scheduling.churchofjesuschrist.org/) and notice the new bar at the bottom.\n2. Pick your proxy ordinance and date, and click \"Search Across Temples\".\n3. See the available appointments across all temples close to your chosen temple.\n\nNow that you know where the appointments are, you can make your chosen appointment in the normal way.\n\nThis extension is **not** built by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."
