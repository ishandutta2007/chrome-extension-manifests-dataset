The FFmpeg library, which is compiled from the C/C++ language to JavaScript using the Emscripten compiler, is used. Emscripten is a source-to-source compiler that converts native C/C++ instructions to JavaScript. To acquire further information about the Emscripten compiler, see this Wikipedia article.\n\nTo use this add-on, just open the app UI and drag a video file to the designated area. Then input your FFmpeg command into the input file and press the Run button. The link to download the video file will be available at the bottom of the UI once the conversion is finished. Please keep in mind that depending on the video size and type of conversion selected, conversion might take some time. In order for you to start working with this add-on, there are some sample commands (as buttons) offered in the app UI that you may utilize.\n\nBecause this add-on uses the browser version of FFmpeg, it is slower than desktop applications/libraries. The usage of the extension is simple, however. Simply place it in your browser and it will begin to operate immediately without the need for any extra plugins. It's only suited for simple conversions and has a restricted number on codecs."
