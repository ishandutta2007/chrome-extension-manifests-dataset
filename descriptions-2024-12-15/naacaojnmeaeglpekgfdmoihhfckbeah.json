The fundamental objective of most meetings is to align the participants through minutes of meetings, and next steps, prioritisation & visibility of updates on next steps. However, how many times have you had to explain the direction & prioritisation after the meeting ends and how many times have you “discussed” something, when a peer or team member considered it a decision? Also, how many times have you joined a meeting and felt wanting on what was discussed in last meeting and next steps from previous discussion? Again, how many times have you not written next steps because unlike Tech your tasks move very fast (same day deadlines!)? Finally, how many times have you had to call a meeting to see progress on the next steps so you and other stakeholders are updated on progress. We are here to fix that.\n\nIntroducing FogTeams, which is your one-stop solution for alignment, prioritisation, & visibility for all participants in async. Without losing the human touch with voice & video, and context from Screen share.
