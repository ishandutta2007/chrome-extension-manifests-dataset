Cipher\n\nThe user is based on the ceaser cipher which takes two inputs, the message being encrypted/decrypted and a numerical key. The cipher shifts the ASCII value of the message by the key and outputs the result. \n\n2. Abstract Calculator \n\nThe Abstract Calculator consists of four functions: \n\n     a. A base conversion calculator - two inputs are taken from the user, a number \n        in decimal and the base from 2-36 the user wants to convert it to. The \n        function outputs the user's decimal number in their requested base. \n\n     b. Fibonacci - enter a positive number and the function will return that \n        position within the Fibonacci sequence. \n\n     c. Pascal's Triangle - two inputs are taken from the user, a row and a column. \n        The function then returns the value that is at the row and column of P \n        Pascal's Triangle that the user requested.\n\n     d. Pythagorean - enter your A value and your B value and the function will \n        output the C value using the Pythagorean Theorem. \n\n3. Clicker \n\nClick on the \"Click Me\" button and the value representing the button will increment by 1 when it is clicked. It is similar to your ordinary clicker but there is a catch!\n\n4. BCA Links\n\nIn order to assist students at our school, we organized the most relevant links into one space just in case a student does not have a link to an important school related website saved.\n\n5. Lab Answers \n\nAlthough it is the most simple button, it is our group's favorite. You will not be spared for breaking the pledge \"I shall take all assessments with honor and integrity and put forth work that is my own\". \n\nUpdate Logs:\n\nV 1.0 - Publish onto Chrome!"
