It enables you to save the current status of a candidate in a note on the profile, so that you can navigate Linkedin faster. Your notes are then automatically synchronized to your search results, so that you can recognize your candidates on the search engines. \nIf you invite your team you can view and collaborate on your team's candidate notes and recruit with the collective candidate knowledge of your team.\n\nIt is designed for recruiting teams who don't want to waste time and money on traditional applicant tracking systems and would rather use a swift light weight applicant tracking solution.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nIt boosts your searching speed by embedding the notes you collect about webpages into the place you need it the most, your search results! Instead of isolated note taking apps, Embedding a note about a web page to the page itself enables you to differentiate between search results you already know from past searches.\n\nWhenX Notes are different from other note taking apps. You visit a website and take a note with something to remember about this website. Next time you visit that website you see a subtle notification with your note. It's Notes that you don't need to search for in a directory of notes, they come in your way, only when you need them.\n\n\n🥇 Featured in SourceCon, MakeUseOf, CHIP, GadgetHacks and many others 🥇\n\n🗒️ Web Notes\nFinally, notes that you actually find back, only when you need them.\n✓ Take a note on any web page (ALT + X)\n✓ If this webpage appears in your search results, the note appears right beside it\n✓ Get notified about your note, whenever you open this web page\n✓ Manage all your notes in the dashboard\n\n🗒️ Linkedin™ Notes (For Recruiters & Sales)\nCreate a candidate pipeline for your sourcing.\n✓ Take a note on any Linkedin profile you see\n✓ Select candidate status like ‘Contacted’, ‘Favorite’ or ‘Rejected’\n✓ See your note whenever you open this Linkedin profile\n✓ See your notes beside search results when you X-ray Linkedin\n✓ Update your candidate status at any time\n✓ Update your candidate status at any time\n✓ Manage all your candidates in the dashboard\n✓ Applicant Tracking System for Sourcing\n✓ COMING SOON: share your candidate status among your team to source collaboratively.\n\n🕒 Timestamps\nDifferentiate between search results by knowing when you opened them.\n✓ Adds a tag with your last visit time (we call it Timestamp) next to the link!\n✓ Helps you re-find webpages you visited before\n✓ Gives you a time context about when you searched for certain topics.\n✓ No need to search through your history\n✓ Works retrospectively, for pages visited before even installing the extension \n✓ Find that page you saw ‘3 days ago’\n✓ Gives you a time context about when you searched for certain topics. \n✓ No action needed. Timestamps appear automatically beside previously visited search results \n\n\n💚 Favorites\nLike Search Results that you want to highlight for your next searches.\n✓ Instead of bookmarking a page, which doesn’t help you when you are searching, ‘Like’ the search result to make it stand out in your next searches\n✓ If a favorite webpage appears in your search results, a heart icon appears right beside it\n✓ Manage all your Likes in the dashboard\n\n☆☆☆ Used by employees at Uber, Google, Twitter, by top recruiting teams and by researchres in 380 universities ☆☆☆\n\nWhenX is used by thousands of companies for:  \n✓ Recruiting / Headhunting \n✓ Searching for Leads and managing the status of the lead \n✓ Research and Development\n✓ Market Research\n✓ Searching for Programming Questions \n✓ Professional Searching \n✓ Interactive Bookmarking \n\n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n🔍 Re-find web pages\nInstead of bookmarking every page you might need in the future, timestamps and notes help you identify webpages you have seen before, when you search for them.\n\n🚫 Avoid irrelevant links\nA timestamp with a recent date like 'yesterday' or '8 hours ago' helps you avoid opening pages you recently explored, hence saves time reopening them.\n\n🚀 Keep track of your searching progress\nTimestamps and Notes enable you to continue searching where you last stopped.
