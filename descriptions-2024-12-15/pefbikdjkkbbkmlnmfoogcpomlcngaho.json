These aren't especially helpful commit messages and \"Merged in\" just becomes noise. This extension will use the title of your PR as the commit message instead which should lead to a much more useful commit history. The bulleted list of individual commit messages and approvals will still appear in the body of the commit message.\n\nTo tell Atlassian that this should be the default behavior, go to the following URL and vote for the issue.\n\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-19402"
