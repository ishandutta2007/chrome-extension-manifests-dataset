You don't have to go to a separate website or comb through columns of data to get the info you need, either. Clarity Live does the hard work for you by creating heatmaps and session recordings that you can view without leaving your site. These data visualizations make it simple to analyze engagement, optimize your design, and quickly identify and fix problems. \n \nHow it works: Download the extension and set up a free Clarity account if you don't already have one. Then simply navigate to the page or specific experience you want to explore and select the heatmap, area heatmap, or session recording icon on the Clarity widget. Voila! Whichever Clarity feature you chose launches right over the page you're on. That's it. Analytics has never been so easy!\n \nHighlights\n \nHeatmaps: Clarity Live combines two types of heatmap into one view. Click heatmaps capture the most clicked (or tapped) elements on a page. Scroll heatmaps reveal the most viewed areas on a page by showing how far users scroll. Clarity Live makes it easy to see engagement for flyouts, popups, dropdown lists, and other elements that can be difficult to capture in a typical heatmap experience. \n \nArea heatmaps: Instead of visualizing engagement on the element level, these heatmaps allow you to select an area, which could contain several elements, to get the total clicks and click distribution rate. An area could include just one element or be as large as the entire page. You're in control.   \n \nSession recordings: These give you a front-row seat to individual sessions. These animated renderings capture how a user explored your site, by showing you where they clicked or tapped, where they hesitated, and how they moved their cursor. Clarity Live makes it a snap to find recordings for a specific experience, too. For example, if you wanted to see how a user engages with a particular popup, you could fire the popup on your site, and select the recording icon on the widget. You would instantly see relevant recordings made within the last three days.  \n \nA note on pricing: Clarity is 100% free. You'll never be asked to upgrade to a paid version. No credit card is required to sign up for a Clarity account. Learn more(https://clarity.microsoft.com/pricing)\n \nStop guessing. Get Clarity. \n \nHappy visualizing!"
