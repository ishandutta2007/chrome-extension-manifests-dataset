We value simplicity and speed and we've made it really easy for you to get started.\n\nReadio attempts to find the correct content on each page automatically, and places a quick access button in the bottom right corner of every readable page. The quick access buttons allow you to read the automatically detected text or open the editor to paste your own text. Of course, you can always select and right click any text on a page to read it.\n\nEveryone has their own preferences, and therefore we've built in multiple options to personalize Readio to your liking. These options include dark/bright themes, word positioning and highlighting, font styles, speed variation, and much more!\n\nWe're still in the beta phase, so please feel free to leave feedback if you notice anything wonky or have any feature suggestions. You can also help develop Readio by contributing to our open source repository on Github:\n\nhttps://github.com/nicklassandell/Speed-reader"
