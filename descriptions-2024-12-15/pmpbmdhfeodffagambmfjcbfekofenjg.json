Dyslexico uses AI to understand writing in context and infer what the writer intended better than one-size-fits-all tools. \n\nHow it works\n\nUse Dyslexico for Chrome by opening the tool in the sidebar. Simply copy your text in and hit the green checkmark to get corrections. Click on corrections to accept the changes. When you are done editing, paste it back to your site.\n\nDyslexico is uniquely designed to help improve writing skills with word definitions, error classification, and text-to-speech. Not all features are available yet in Dyslexico for Chrome. Access the full suite of accessibility tools and error analytics on full site: https://dyslexi.co"
