Maybe a quote, an image, or some data that you know you'll want to revisit later on. Well, that's where Snapshots comes in!\n\nIntroducing Snapshots - Your Personal Web Scrapbook\n\nSnapshots is a chrome extension that lets you bookmark anything and everything you find interesting on the web. It's like Twitter bookmarks, but better - because you can capture any type of content you want, from any website you visit.\n\nPrivacy First: We Don't Track Anything, Ever\n\nThe best part? We're privacy-first! We don't track anything, and all data goes straight from your browser to your Google Doc. So you can rest assured that your personal information is safe with us.\n\nHow It Works: Easy as 1-2-3\n\nHere's how it works: \n- Install the Snapshots extension and log in. Don't worry - we won't spam you, and we won't track anything you snapshot. \n- Once you're logged in, create a document for your interests. For example, you could create a document for all things business, or maybe one for funny memes you come across.\n- Now comes the fun part! As you're browsing the web, whenever you find something you want to save, just select the text or image and click the right mouse button. You'll see \"Send to Snapshot\" in the chrome context menu. Select the document you want to add it to, and voila! \nYou've just saved something awesome.\n\nCreate Multiple Documents and Keep Them Organized\n\nYou can create as many documents as you want for different purposes, and easily structure and catalog what you find interesting. And don't worry about losing the formatting of the text or image - we preserve it to give you a pleasant experience.\n\nGet Notified When Your Documents Are Updated\n\nOh, and one more thing - if you give us notification access, you'll receive a notification when your document is successfully updated. So you can be sure that your awesome finds are safely stored in your Google Drive.\n\nMade in India\n\nWe are proud to say that Snapshots was born out of a personal use case and developed in India. We love hearing from our users and are constantly working to improve the app based on their feedback.\n\nThank You for Choosing Snapshots!\n\nThank you for downloading and using Snapshots. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed!"
