That's why we deemed it necessary to build something to solve this problem. \n\nWith this app, you will gain an in-depth understanding of your strengths and weaknesses as a trader. Track all crypto trades in your new-tab window. See the charts for the top 300 cryptos and place paper orders through the new-tab or the popup. \n\nSupport for real orders is coming. First, we need to establish, with certainty, that we have achieved product-market-fit - then we will build out the remaining features. This app is built leveraging coinGecko and Messari APIs - with live price feeds and no-noise charts. \n\nYou've probably heard of us thanks to our exclusive 'trade-snapshot' feature. Whereby, you can see the charts of all your previous trades whilst the trade was open. Yep. The most useful and potentially profitable feature on the market, offered by a free trader's tool.\n\nWe appreciate all feedback - since this is going to be a free product for at least the first 3 months, we request that you please leave reviews and messages on our twitter page. Bug finders will be rewarded!\n\nExperience technical analysis the way the pro's do - without needing to go to an external website. Trade Tracker opens every time you open a new tab! Find out more on our website. Become the best you can be with our proprietary account performance indicators - built for traders, by traders. The best way to track your performance in today's markets. Due to currently being in beta-testing, we are set to CAP THIS RELEASE TO 100 USERS until early 2023 when we will release the alpha."
