When you click on a link, it is common for tracking parameters such as \"fbclid,\" \"utm_source,\" and \"ref\" (to name a few) to be added to the link in order for companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon to track the source of the traffic and gather information about your browsing habits. This extension removes these trackers before you are redirected to the new page.\n\nHiding your referrer, which is automatically set by your browser and sent to the new website, has several benefits. It protects your privacy by preventing external sites from seeing what pages you have visited and what links you have clicked on. It also prevents third-party trackers from tracking your online activity across different websites and helps you avoid targeted ads based on your browsing history. By hiding your referrer, you can see ads that are less personalized and potentially less relevant to you.\n\nThis extension and the companion service does not collect, log or otherwise store your browsing habit or any information to personally identify you. The source code is open in Github (https://github.com/mustakimali/privacy-redirect) and you are welcome to examine them.\n\nDon't be worried about the permission: Access your data for all websites\nThis is needed to intercept when you are about to be redirected so that it can remove tracking parameters (and hide your referrer).\nThe source code should be simple to understand no foul play is happening here."
