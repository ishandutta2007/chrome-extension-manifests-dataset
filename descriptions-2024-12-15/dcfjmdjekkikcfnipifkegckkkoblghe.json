As you complete sales orders, you can open the cash drawer and print sales documents such as receipts and tickets.\nNotes and Considerations:\nTo set up a new workstation, note that you also need to complete all other setup steps from the checklist under Tickets, Print Setup in Altru.\nIf Altru users share a machine but have their own Windows profiles/logins, the browser extension needs to be installed for each userâ€™s Windows profile. \nOnly Windows machines are supported at this time."
