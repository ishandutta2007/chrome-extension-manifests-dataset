Clicking the icon navigates to your Salesforce Organizations trust site. \n\nWith a single click upon the Salesforce Org Status icon you will be navigated to your Salesforce Organizations STATUS & MAINTENANCE site which allows you to quickly check for issues, maintenance, and important information pertaining to your current Salesforce instance.\n\nThis extension works with both the normal Salesforce login as well as MyDomain. When using MyDomain it is not always immediately apparent what instance you are currently on and this extension takes all the guesswork away with just a single click on the icon. Salesforce Org Status works with both Salesforce Classic and Salesforce lightning!\n\n*Sandbox compatibility coming soon*"
