By automatically advancing to the next video in a course, it eliminates the need for users to manually click through each lesson. This helps improve focus and efficiency, allowing learners to stay engaged and complete courses more seamlessly, especially during long learning sessions. The Auto Play feature is designed to support users who prefer a continuous, hands-free experience while taking courses, maximizing their productivity and time spent on the platform."
