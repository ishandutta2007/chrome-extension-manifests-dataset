This extension is relevant for Norwegian users doing international shopping online.\n\nWhat is VOEC?\nForeign online shops and online marketplaces can register with the Norwegian Tax Administration. Online shops and online marketplaces will collect up to 25 % Norwegian VAT when you, as a private individual, shop with them. This scheme is called VOEC (VAT On E-Commerce) and is administered by the Norwegian Tax Administration.\n\nThe Norwegian Tax administration will not charge you 25% + cost of taxing on import, rather leaving it up to the registered company to handle this section. Thus, you can purchase from VOEC-listed companies like Amazon or Ableton, and receive the product with the advertised price."
