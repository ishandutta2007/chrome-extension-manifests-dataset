To submit bugs, requests, ideas, and see known issues and changes, please see here\nhttps://github.com/coinzdude/javascript-errors-notifier/commits/master\n\nAbout this extension:\nThe original JavaScript Errors Notifier won me over as a tester and developer as it helps me find JavaScript errors in apps being developed before getting to my clients. The configurable options for levels of notifications, ease of copying error details, and unobtrusiveness are very important to me. The original project was delisted from the Chrome Web Store, and had aged as well, no longer being supported as a \"manifest v2\" project versus the newer and now required \"manifest v3\".  I want this project to be available in the chrome store for ease of installation for myself and my teammates. In the effort I found I could keep going with this excellent foundation and incorporate additional features like domain level filtering and options management, and some UX changes.\n\nAs a developer/tester, I am reworking and republishing this excellent utility. More details about how it started\nhttps://github.com/barbushin/javascript-errors-notifier/issues/101.\n\nProject source\nhttps://github.com/coinzdude/javascript-errors-notifier\n\nPlease share feedback here \nhttps://github.com/coinzdude/javascript-errors-notifier/issues/new"
