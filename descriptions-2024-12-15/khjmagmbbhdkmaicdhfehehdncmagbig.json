This could be useful if you're in a meeting or watching a YouTube video, and want to quickly switch back to it from another tab.\n\nIf you have multiple Chrome profiles active at the time, it'll only take you to the tab making sound in the current profile you're looking at, so you'll have to install this on all Chrome profiles that you expect to use it on, and have to switch to the correct profile (ctrl-`) for it to work in that case. This is a limitation of the Chrome extension APIs, sorry :("
