Later the extension will be capable of doing tasks on AWS resources.\nAt the moment not all features work - they are WIP.\n\nUsage:\nCreate a file on you local machine where the browser can load it from. \nThe format of the file is the same as the aws cli's credentials file.\nSample:\n[profile_name]\naws_access_key_id = \naws_secret_access_key = \naws_session_token = ( optional )\n\nSame as with the aws cli - you can have multiple profiles inside the credential file. The extension will store all in the browser's storage and they can be chosen on the option page.\nI suggest creating a user with only read access ( for the alpha version ) to the AWS resources in IAM when using this extension.\n\nAll reviews and opinions are appreciated. Thanks.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe extension stores all data in the browser, nothing leaves the user's computer. It is the user's responsibility to erase sensible data if needed."
