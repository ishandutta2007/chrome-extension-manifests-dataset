Updated now to track ongoing luck vs average (for 20 sided dice only for now). See how lucky you are long term.\n\nAnother new feature: Roll against a threshold.  If you are using this for gaming as a GM, then you have a simple place to set up as many rolls as you want and see how many successes and failures you roll.  Roll as few or as many as you want of whatever kind of dice you would commonly use.  This is also excellent for shadowrun if you just want something simple to track your hits."
