When people see a news article and it says \"such and such a REPUBLICAN\" or \"such and such a DEMOCRAT\" they instantly get heated. They barely pay attention to the facts or what the article is even about. They are only focused on one thing. That the other party is full of idiots. I wanted to make this to remove the designation of both parties from any website you visit. This way you can focus on the the message and or ideas a person presents rather than what party they belong to."
