We all have those \"regretsy\" moments. \n\nMillions of dollars have been spent by marketers trying to get your emotional brain to pay for things before your rational brain can catch up. One-click checkout, saving payment information, all developed to get you to buy now, think later.\n\nSo how do you combat this? Simple. You use the same psychology tricks they use.\n\nHabit Money's Checkout Snooze combats impulse spending by forcing you to pause before you buy something. That simple pause gives your rational brain a chance to catch up.\n\nYou might still make the purchase, but you will do so intentionally.\n\nEvery time you go to a checkout page, the Checkout Snooze will pop up and ask you if you want to sleep on it, or continue.\n\nIf you continue, the pop-up will disappear and you can continue with your purchase.\n\nIf you snooze, your checkout will be saved in the Habit Money extension. You can click on it and see your saved checkouts and get back to them anytime. We'll save them for 2 weeks for you.\n\nUse the Checkout Snooze to save money, spend intentionally, and feel in control of your money!"
