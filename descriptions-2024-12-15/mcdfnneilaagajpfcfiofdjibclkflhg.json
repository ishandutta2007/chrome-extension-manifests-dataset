Noads is here to help! This lightweight yet powerful Chrome extension puts you in control of your online environment by efficiently removing unwanted advertisements and sponsored content from web pages.\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. Effective Ad Blocking:\nNoads uses a sophisticated system of CSS selectors to identify and remove a wide range of advertisements from web pages. Our default list of selectors targets common ad formats, including:\n\n- Banner ads\n- Sidebar ads\n- In-content ads\n- Video ads and pre-roll advertisements\n- Sponsored content\n- Pop-ups and overlays\n\nBy removing these elements, Noads creates a cleaner, more focused browsing experience, allowing you to concentrate on the content that matters most.\n\n2. Customizable Blocking Rules:\nWhile Noads comes pre-configured with an extensive list of ad-blocking selectors, we understand that every user's needs are unique. That's why we've made it incredibly easy to add your own custom CSS selectors:\n\n- Open the Noads popup by clicking the extension icon\n- Enter your desired CSS selectors in the provided textarea\n- Click \"Add Selectors\" to implement your custom rules\n\nThis flexibility allows you to target specific ad elements that might slip through the default filters or to block any other page elements you find distracting.\n\n3. User-Friendly Interface:\nNoads features a clean, intuitive popup interface that makes managing your ad-blocking settings a breeze:\n\n- Toggle the extension on/off with a single click\n- View all active blocking rules at a glance\n- Add new selectors quickly and easily\n- Remove individual selectors with a simple click\n\n4. Real-Time Ad Removal:\nNoads doesn't just work when a page first loads. It continuously monitors for changes to the webpage, ensuring that dynamically loaded ads are caught and removed as they appear. This proactive approach means you won't be surprised by ads that pop up as you scroll or interact with a page.\n\n5. Performance Optimized:\nWe've designed Noads with efficiency in mind. By using CSS selectors and lightweight JavaScript, the extension has minimal impact on your browsing speed. In fact, by removing resource-heavy ads, Noads can often improve page load times and reduce bandwidth usage.\n\n6. Privacy Focused:\nUnlike some ad blockers that may track your browsing habits or sell your data, Noads is committed to your privacy. The extension operates entirely on your local machine and doesn't send any of your browsing data to external servers.\n\n7. Works Across Websites:\nNoads is designed to function effectively across a wide range of websites. Whether you're browsing news sites, blogs, video platforms, or social media, Noads works diligently to remove unwanted advertisements and create a more pleasant browsing experience.\n\n8. Iframe Protection:\nNoads goes the extra mile by injecting its content script into iframes. This ensures that ads embedded within iframes (a common technique used by advertisers to bypass simpler ad blockers) are also removed, providing more comprehensive ad blocking.\n\n9. Persistent Settings:\nYour ad-blocking preferences are automatically saved and synced across your Chrome installations. This means your custom selectors and on/off state will be consistent whether you're using Chrome on your desktop, laptop, or other devices.\n\n10. Open Source:\nNoads is an open-source project, which means its code is publicly available for review. This transparency allows security-conscious users to verify the extension's functionality and even contribute improvements to the project.\n\nTechnical Details:\n\nNoads is built using modern web technologies to ensure robust performance and easy maintenance:\n\n- Core functionality written in TypeScript, providing strong typing and improved code quality\n- Styles defined using Sass, allowing for more maintainable and organized CSS\n- Bundled and optimized using a custom build process for maximum efficiency\n- Leverages Chrome's storage API for seamless syncing of user preferences\n- Utilizes the MutationObserver API to dynamically respond to page changes\n\nHow Noads Works:\n\n1. When you visit a webpage, Noads springs into action. It retrieves the list of ad-blocking selectors from Chrome's storage.\n\n2. These selectors are then used to identify ad elements on the page. Any matching elements are immediately removed from the DOM, effectively making them disappear from your view.\n\n3. Noads sets up a MutationObserver to watch for any changes to the page's structure. If new elements are added that match the ad selectors, they are promptly removed.\n\n4. For pages with iframes, Noads injects its content script into each iframe, ensuring that ads can't hide in these embedded contexts.\n\n5. When you add new selectors through the popup interface, they are immediately saved to Chrome's storage and applied to the current page. The page is then reloaded to ensure the new rules take effect.\n\n6. If you toggle the extension off, Noads will stop removing elements, allowing the page to display normally. Toggling it back on will reapply the ad-blocking rules.\n\nDefault Ad-Blocking Selectors:\n\nNoads comes pre-configured with a carefully curated list of CSS selectors designed to target common ad elements across a wide range of websites. These include:\n\n- #ad, #ads, .adsbygoogle\n- Various permutations of \"ad\" and \"ads\" in id and class attributes\n- Iframe-based ads\n- Video ad containers\n- Elements with \"Advertisement\" in their aria-label\n- And many more...\n\nThis default list provides a strong foundation for ad blocking right out of the box, while still allowing for easy customization to suit your specific needs.\n\nCustomization Examples:\n\nHere are a few examples of how you might use custom selectors to enhance your browsing experience:\n\n1. Block a specific annoying element on your favorite news site:\n   #annoying-newsletter-signup\n\n2. Remove \"recommended content\" sections that often contain disguised ads:\n   .recommended-content, .you-may-also-like\n\n3. Hide social media share buttons if you find them distracting:\n   .social-share-buttons\n\n4. Block cookie consent popups (use with caution and respect site policies):\n   #cookie-consent-popup, .gdpr-notice\n\n5. Remove autoplay video players that often contain ads:\n   .autoplay-video-container\n\nRemember, with great power comes great responsibility. While Noads gives you the ability to remove almost any element from a webpage, we encourage using this power ethically and in compliance with website terms of service.\n\nCommitment to Improvement:\n\nThe Noads team is dedicated to continuously improving the extension. We regularly update our default selector list to keep up with evolving ad techniques, and we're always working on performance optimizations and new features.\n\nWe also highly value user feedback. If you encounter any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to contribute to the project, we encourage you to visit our GitHub repository and get involved.\n\nPrivacy and Permissions:\n\nNoads requires certain permissions to function effectively, but we're committed to using these responsibly:\n\n- \"activeTab\": Allows Noads to interact with the current tab when you invoke it.\n- \"scripting\": Necessary for injecting the content script that removes ad elements.\n- \"storage\": Used to save your preferences and custom selectors.\n- \"tabs\": Required for reloading tabs when settings change.\n- \"webNavigation\": Helps Noads work effectively with iframes.\n\nRest assured, Noads does not collect any personal data or browsing history. All operations are performed locally on your machine.\n\nConclusion:\n\nNoads represents a new generation of ad-blocking technology - one that puts the power in your hands. By combining effective default settings with unprecedented customization options, Noads offers a personalized solution to online advertising.\n\nExperience the web the way it was meant to be: clean, fast, and focused on content. With Noads, you're not just blocking ads; you're reclaiming your online experience.\n\nInstall Noads today and rediscover the pleasure of distraction-free browsing!"
