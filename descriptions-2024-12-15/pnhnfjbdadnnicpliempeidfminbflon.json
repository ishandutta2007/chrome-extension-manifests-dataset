No more do you have to worry about missing a bracket or mistyping your equation with the real-time preview. You can then search for the equation on WolframAlpha to solve it or see more information. You can also copy or save the equation as an image by right-clicking it, or by dragging in sites such as Google Docs.\n\nYou can use the extension directly on the WolframAlpha website by clicking the Quick Equations icon on the page.\n\nTo access extension options, right-click the extension button and select \"Options\".\n\nYou can use Quick Equations on any WeBWorK site by enabling that feature in the extension options.\n\nThe extension also supports Google Forms and that can be enabled in the options. To add an equation as part of a question, click the image button in Google Forms and then drag the equation from the extension popup to the drop area. You can also preview equations while answering questions or viewing responses by clicking the Quick Equations icon next to them."
