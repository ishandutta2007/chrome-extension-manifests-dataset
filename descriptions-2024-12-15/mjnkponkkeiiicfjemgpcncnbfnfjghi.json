This extension enhances your browsing experience by providing useful features like Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Translate accessible through the browser's context menu.\n\nTo install the Choose All Languages extension, simply visit the Chrome Web Store and add it to your browser.\n\nOnce the extension is installed, you can utilize it in two ways. First, you can make use of the context menu option. Just select any word or text snippet, right-click on it, and choose the Choose All Languages extension from the options that appear. This will allow you to translate the selected text, look it up on Google Dictionary, or search for synonyms on PowerThesaurus.com.\n\nAlternatively, you can utilize the toolbar button provided by the extension. To use this feature, you need to pin the extension icon to your browser's toolbar. You can refer to an article for detailed instructions on how to pin the icon successfully. Once pinned, you can click on the toolbar button whenever you want to translate the current tab's page. This action will load the translated page in a new tab.\n\nFurthermore, since the translate feature relies on Google Translate, you have the option to set a default language for translations. To do this, follow these steps:\n\nAccess the extension's settings page by selecting the corresponding option in the context menu:\nProvide steps here to open the settings page (specific instructions might be needed)\n\nBy following these instructions, you can fully utilize theChoose All Languages extension and customize it to meet your translation needs."
