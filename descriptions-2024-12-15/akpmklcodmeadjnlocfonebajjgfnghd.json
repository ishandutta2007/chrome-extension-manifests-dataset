Press shift + ctrl + L while inside of the email textarea and a banner message will popup indicating your previous message input into your clipboard\n\nChanges as of 1.0.06:\n-Modified Engineering automation so that only cases that have not had any public update already on the current day will have the automated update\n-Changed the \"Pend Eng\" automation button in the extension popup to \"Case Update\" as it now has been expanded to also update cases that have had no public comment from the current day and are in Customer Action Requested or Awaiting Customer Verification\n-When you hover over case comments, you can get a popup with the case comments for that case instead of waiting for slow loading of each case tab\n-Fixed issue with Table views and certain functionality only loaded once on initial page load\n-Implement check to clear all sessionStorage for emails that are for cases that are not currently opened\n\nChanges as of 1.0.07:\n-Fixed issue with case comments popup to get dynamic frawmework uid (fwuid) which is needed to hit this API endpoint on Salesforce\n\nChanges as of 1.0.08:\n-Fixed issue with initial comment timer not working correctly in Chrome\n-Fixed an issue with adding initial SF table helper view when table is empty, as well as replacing text once all values are removed from the helper view array\n\nChanges as of 1.0.09:\n-Fixed an issue with framework UID not getting updated in some cases.
