Everybody wants to talk about productivity these days. \n\nBut nobody wants to talk about the elephant in the room. \n\nI’m kind of a lazy schlub, and I built this extension so that I can get my work done as fast as humanly possible. \n\nAnd it will work for you too. \n\nThink of it as an Accountabilibuddy - for the internet.\n\nSee, you can look at all the task management apps you want - play focus music, set pomodoro timers, and block social media until your fingers fall off… Trust me, I’ve been there. \n\nBut when it comes down to it, all you really want is to get your things done in as little time as possible.\n\nJust like me. \n\nWhether you use that extra time you save on Bob Ross paintings or sail the 7 seas is up to you. I’m just here to help you finish your work faster. \n\nAccording to the American Society of Training and Development (ASTD - unfortunate acronym for such smart people): \n\nYou have a 65% chance of completing a task if you commit to it to someone. If you’ve committed to a specific time when that person should check in on it, you increase your chance of success by up to 95%. \n\nSo while you can get 1000 different productivity extensions and paste monkeyfeathers to your head to turn your neck 2% faster, all you really need is some accountability. \n\nAnd that’s all that this extension does. \n\nYou tell it what you’re going to do, and how much time you think it will take you. \n\nAt the end of that time, the extension will keep you accountable by asking if you completed it. \n\nAnd you, my friend, will leave with a 95% better chance of doing the things you want to do, with less wasted time. \n\n\nToo long, didn’t read? \n\nYou RECEIVE science-backed methods to save you hours of wasted time a day. \nYou FOLLOW along step-by-step as the extension holds you accountable for getting your work done as quickly as possible\nYou ACCELERATE your work, so that you can go enjoy yourself and shut your frickin computer off. \nYou SAVE thousands of hours of wasted time. \nYou GAIN access to tested, proven psychological success methods trusted by thousands around the world. \nYou SKIP paying some accountability coach thousands of dollars to help you achieve your goals\nYou SEE before your eyes how much more quickly you complete your work.\nYou GROW a little bit more effective every day\nYou CREATE highly effective habits that will last you a lifetime. \n\nIf all that sounds good, click the blue Add to Chrome button above to get free access for life."
