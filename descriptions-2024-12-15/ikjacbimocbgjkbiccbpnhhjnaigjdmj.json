Are you struggling with the genders of nouns? If yes, this extension will help you.\n\nEvery time you open a new tab, you'll be shown a German noun along with its meaning and gender. Each word will have a relevant emoji and the background will be color coded according to the gender of the word.\n\nThis will help you in two ways\n\n(1) Gives you repeated exposure: Exposure to words repeatedly will subconsciously register them without any intentional effort.\n\n(2) Encourages visual association: A helpful emoji along with the color coding will help you develop a visual association of the gender of the noun."
