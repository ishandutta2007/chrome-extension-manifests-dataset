When you select that option and click it, all teams visible on the page will be queued for battle.\nIf there are still some battles left - Reload the page and do it again\n\nWhy?\nAt the moment of writing users have to click several times per team per battle to send axie to battle. This adds up quickly when you have more than 3 teams...\n\n* 2019 jan 29: There are other (better) extensions for this, look for them in the chrome web store\n\nDisclaimer:\n- The Extension depends on generated (uglified/obfuscated)-css classes - so anytime these class-names change, the script becomes unusable until the proper class-names have been set again.\n- I made this script because the process of sending all of my axies to battle literally hurts my arm\n- I am not a member of the axie team\n\nRemember: This is just a temporary solution until the axie devteam implements similar functionality on the website. When the time comes they have done so, we can all think back of this time and smile. How silly we were...\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFind me @Cryptokkie on twitter and discord \n\nPeace & Love\n\n-------------------------------\nnote: The extension can only send teams to battle that are shown on the screen, when you have more than 50 teams and want to send all the teams at once, you have to expand the list first so it shows all the teams including the 51st, 52nd etc\n-------------------------------\n\n1.03 - 25 feb 2019 Forgot to check some other css classes, fixes and everything works now!\n\n1.02 - 25 feb 2019 The css classname for teams changed, adjusted in source.\n\n1.01 Fixed a bug that prevented the extension from appearing in the context-menu when right clicked"
