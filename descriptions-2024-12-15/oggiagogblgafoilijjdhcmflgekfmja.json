It is an unofficial extension that is developed and maintained independently by its author. Note, YouTube™ is a registered trademark of Google Inc.\n\nNote #1: this add-on is a simplified version of Audio Equalizer add-on and specifically designed for the YouTube website only. It is very lite and has no toolbar button (the equalizer button is placed on YouTube page). The add-on works for both YouTube website and all other YouTube embedded videos.\n\nThere are 18 audio presets available to choose from in the preset drop-down list. For example, you can choose, pop, club, party, soft rock dance, or any other preset format for the audio stream. Please note that the equalizer button is placed below the video title on the YouTube website. Simply click on the equalizer button to view the drop-down list.\n\nNote #2: If you want a comprehensive Equalizer add-on that works for all websites and media (audio and video), please install my other extension: Audio Equalizer (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/audio-equalizer/cjadmgobonfhilogbdgkkhnoojpgenfg).\n\nNote #3: if you have a feature request, or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form in the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/equalizer-for-youtube.html)."
