This extensions allows you to do just that. You can easily put accounts that you follow and hashtags that you wish would go away in the penalty box, where they will be silenced and feel shame. When you have deemed their sins absolved, you can let them out, free to fill your Twitter stream again.\n\nOpen sourced @ https://github.com/jeffreyiacono/penalty-blox ... send me a PR!"
