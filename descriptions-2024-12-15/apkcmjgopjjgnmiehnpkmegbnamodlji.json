Permanent ID matching is planned, but Aeries.NET does not provide an easy way to match students up to their Permanent ID.\n\nUpdates in v1.9.9:\nImproved name matching algorithm. Should be better at matching names of students who have multiple last and first names.\n\nUpdates in v1.9.8:\nFixed script error caused by conflict with certain other extensions.\n\nUpdates in v1.9.7:\nFixed last entry starting to get ignored by Aeries.\n\nUpdates in v1.9.6:\nImprove name matching algorithm\nUtilize jquery for cleaner page scraping\nOther minor performance improvements\n\nUpdates in v1.9:\nFixed overwrite confirmation\n\nUpdates in v1.8:\nRoll back overwrite confirmation...  not working on some systems.\n\nUpdates in v1.7:\nAttempt to fix name capitalization bug.\nAssignment table no longer jumps to the beginning.\nWarning to confirm overwriting previous data."
