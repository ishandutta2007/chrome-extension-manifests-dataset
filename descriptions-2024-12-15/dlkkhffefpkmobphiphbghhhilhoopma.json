Those times are over, Safe History is here to help.\n\nSafe History works by automatically scanning the web pages you visit and looking for anything that might get you in trouble (porn, NSFW, nudity, profanity, etc.). If something is found the page is automatically flagged, deleted from your browsing history and the browser icon will color itself to notify you your history is in good hands. Everything else is simply ignored and kept in your history like normal.\n\nSafe History features:\n    - Automatic deletion of adult or Not Safe For Work (NSFW) sites history entries right when you view them\n    - Maintains a realistic and clean search history\n    - No user input needed\n    - Keeps all history deemed \"safe\" for all eyes\n\nIf a site manages to slip past the filter please report it.\n\n\nIcon credits: \"data-filter\" by Vecteezy is licensed under CC BY 3.0"
