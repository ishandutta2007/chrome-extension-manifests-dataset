Just be careful not to touch the blue borders as you move. A timer is displayed in the top bar of the maze, indicating the amount of time you've spent on the current level. Once you've completed all the levels, you'll be able to view the total time used.\n\nTo advance to the next level, completion of the current level is required. To return to level one, just click the reset button whenever you wish. If you happen to fail the current level, the game will automatically restart shortly thereafter.\n\nThe extension has thirteen built-in maps and if you want to try more maps, just visit our website to access them. \n\nBeat the maze challenge and have fun! \n\nCHANGELOG\n==========\nVersion 0.1.1 - 0.1.5\n- Add google analytics\n- Update the link to more maps\n\nVersion 0.1.0\n- Initial release of game"
