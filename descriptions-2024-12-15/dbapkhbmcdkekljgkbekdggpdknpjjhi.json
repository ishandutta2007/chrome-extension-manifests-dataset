Cast your mind back to the third of April, in the year of our Lord, two thousand and twenty-three. On that very day, a seismic shift occurred in the digital world, as Twitter - that great bastion of modern communication - made a bold move that would send shockwaves across the globe.\n\nWithout warning or preamble, they swapped their iconic logo for the beloved Doge! Oh, how the people rejoiced! From the highest mountains to the deepest valleys, a mighty cry rose up in unison, hailing this wondrous occurrence. The skies themselves seemed to tremble with the thunderous applause of millions of voices united in joy and excitement.\n\nBut then, in a flash, the Doge vanished, leaving behind only memories of its fleeting glory. Yet fear not, for I - a humble artisan - have crafted a masterpiece that shall immortalize this historic event for all time. A monument of such grandeur and magnificence that it shall stand as a beacon of hope and inspiration to all who gaze upon it.\n\nLet us all come together, dear friends, and pay homage to this beautiful occasion that shall forever be etched in the annals of history as a momentous day for Twitter, the Internet, and all of humankind. Let us bask in the glory of our undying love for the Doge, and let its legacy endure for all eternity!"
