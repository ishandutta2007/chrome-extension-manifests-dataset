This change has understandably upset many of our users, leading to a flood of one-star reviews. We want to assure you that this shift allows us to continue improving the quality and features of the extension. The recent low ratings do not reflect the extension's functionality or user experience. In fact, as of version 12.7.0, Lightning Autofill on the MV3 platform is more capable than the last version on the MV2 platform (v11.9.0). We are dedicated to providing the best service possible and appreciate your understanding and support.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIntroducing Lightning Autofill: the ultimate form-filling tool for maximum productivity and convenience.
