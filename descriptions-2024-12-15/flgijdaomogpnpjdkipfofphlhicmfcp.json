Currently they would need to copy the Job no and navigate to the job screen and search for the job to view the details. This extension will turn the job no into a link that instantly opens the Job Sheet for the customer.\n\nAdditionally, this extension will show the history of a failed asset; has a quote been raised, has a follow up job been created and scheduled.\n\nThere is also ability to toggle the visibility of the description box - by default descriptions are hidden on the job and quote screens, and can become visible/hidden by clicking on the job/quote line.\n\nAn additional 'Job Type' filter has been added in the Job screen, under Advanced. This quickly filters between Proactive and Reactive jobs.\n\nFurther functionality will be added in due course, but if you are looking to improve your customer experience, this extension is needed.\n\nNOTE: This enhancement requires a subscription and licence key."
