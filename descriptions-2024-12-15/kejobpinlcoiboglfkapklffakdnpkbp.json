Make it fun and use the moment to really understand what it is your children care about on Youtube. Once you are happy with a channels content, you can choose to subscribe your child to that channel. There is no limit to the number of channels you can subscribe your child to.\n\n4) Install/Turn on this extension\n\n5) That's it. You have now blocked all other YouTube access apart from the channels you have pre-approved. If you want to add or remove channels, simply turn this extensions off and add/delete as many as needed. Don't forget to turn the extension back on before giving your kids access to YouTube again.\n\nNOTE: YouTube Shorts will be blocked for all channels, including subscribed channels. Children do not need access to endless 3 second dopamine spikes."
