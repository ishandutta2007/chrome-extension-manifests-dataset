Sort bookmarks to folders, give them short and clear names and then you'll have unforgettable experience working with Camellia. It replaces the new tab page and displays all your bookmarks there.\n\nNATIVE BROWSER'S BOOKMARKS\n\nUnlike most extensions that change the new tab page, Camellia uses native browser's bookmarks which sync throughout all your devices and can be exported to another browser. You can get access to all these bookmarks even on your phone where extensions can't be installed. \n\nDON'T PAY FOR WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FREE\n\nAbsolutely the whole functional of Camellia is free. You don't have to pay for bookmark synchronization or their amount. No ads either.\n\nLIGHT AND QUICK \n\nCamellia was created using latest web-technology allowing it to load on the new tab page almost in an instant even on slower PC's.\n\nOPEN SOURCE\n\nWhole code of Camellia is on GitHub in open access, therefore you don't need to worry about Camellia doing something without your evidence."
