After installing the extension, add your favorite website to the list. Then, when you search for a keyword in Google, the extension displays the number of your websites that appear in the top 100 search results. By opening the extension's list, you can view the specific rank of each website.\n\nGet an overview of how well your site performs for specific keywords in a glance, monitor the performance of targeted keywords and your page rank, and use the extension to get SEO insights and optimize your content and improve your search engine visibility.\n\nNote: The rank displayed in the extension's pop-up may differ from what you see in regular search results. The extension uses a cookie-free request to fetch the top 100 Google results, similar to searching in incognito mode, providing a closer approximation of what your audience may see."
