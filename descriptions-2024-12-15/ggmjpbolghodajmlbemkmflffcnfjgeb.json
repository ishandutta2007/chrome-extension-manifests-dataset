It visually associates an official company logo (favicon) to someone who sends you an email, without having to open the email itself. It's like \"caller id\" for your email.\n\nNow you can prioritize triaging your email response time to large companies first, instead of individuals with a free email account on platforms like Gmail™, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. \n\nEasily Identify:\n- Companies in your inbox\n- Invoices to pay (Paypal, Venmo, etc)\n- Inter-office emails\n- Purchase Orders \n\nThe icon (aka favicon) is determined by the sender's email domain address, and appears on the same line as your email preview. \n\nFor example, if you receive an email from elon@tesla.com, this Gmail™ extension will add the Tesla logo next to your message preview so that you can immediately identify that Elon is probably very important and you should return his message before others in your inbox.\n\nA note on privacy and security:\nAll logo (favicon) processing is done locally within your browser, and no Gmail™  data is ever uploaded or shared anywhere.\n\ncloudHQ. Helping your productivity, 1 click at a time.\n\ncloudHQ Website: https://www.cloudhq.net/\nApp Website: https://www.email-sender-icons.com\nPricing: FREE\nSupport page: https://support.cloudhq.net\nBlog: https://support.cloudhq.net/category/browser-extensions/email-sender-icons/\n\nGmail is a trademark of Google LLC.
