From the player window open the options menu and select 'Share Algorithm'. You will see a modal dialog containing a link to the algorithm. Copy and paste this link wherever you wish. Openers of the link do not need to be registered or signed into algomation.com it use it.\n\nThe algomation site also supported embedding the algorithm on another site in much the same way that YouTube videos can be embedded on other websites. From the options menu select the 'Get Embed Script' command. You will be presented with a modal dialog that allows you to customize the size of the player that is embedded. Once you have selected the desired size copy and paste the embed script into the source for your webpage or blog. The embedded player is a stripped down version of the player that show only the animated display surface. The algorithm is run automatically within the embedded player. Clicks on the algorithm will direct the viewer to the full player page for the algorithm on algomation.com"
