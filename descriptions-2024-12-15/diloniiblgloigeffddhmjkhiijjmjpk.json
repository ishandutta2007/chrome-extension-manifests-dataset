All you need to remember is one password.\n\nYou do not need to enter this password every time you want to log in. All you need to do is click on the key icon in your toolbar and copy the password.\n\nAny data you enter are encrypted using the AES-256 standard (which is approved and used by the US Government for \"TOP SECRET\" grade material).\n\nThis is more secure than using the SuperGenPass bookmarklet (as with Cygen, sites are unable to retrieve your master password, and your password is not stored in plaintext). All data are encrypted on-the-fly and are not transmitted outside of your computer (feel free to do a code audit: https://github.com/andryou/cygen)\n\nI highly recommend using this along with LastPass: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=en\n\nCredits to SuperGenPass for the idea and password generation code.\n\nChangelog:\n\nv1.0.1.4 - fixed repeating notification\nv1.0.1.1/1.0.1.2/1.0.1.3 - fixed notifications for fresh installations\nv1.0.1.0 - updated required permissions (only requires \"Tabs\" permission now)\nv1.0.0.9 - updated extension name, made Options page more intuitive\nv1.0.0.8 - fixed + tweaked Security Reset Interval capabilities, tweaked random salt (you'll need to re-enter your master password/stealth phrase again, sorry!)\nv1.0.0.7 - added Options link to popup widget, made the random salt... more random :) You'll need to re-configure Cygen to match your previous settings.\nv1.0.0.6 - set default Master Password Reset Interval to every 24 hours\nv1.0.0.5 - updated Options page layout\nv1.0.0.4 - added option to reset Master Password at a specific interval (e.g. every 24 hours)\nv1.0.0.3 - minor code cleanup\nv1.0.0.2 - added a check to block any Chrome extensions from accessing your encrypted data; random salt added to to AES-256 encryption phrase to make your Cygen instance truly unique.\nv1.0.0.1 - \"Password Length\" setting now encrypted in AES-256.\nv1.0.0.0 - Initial release."
