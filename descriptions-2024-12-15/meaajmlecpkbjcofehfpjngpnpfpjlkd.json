Duplicate and edit a Format similar to your needs making changes by example\n\n- Create fully-customized Formats: Use the examples and built-in helpers with a little knowledge of Handlebars, HTML or Markdown, and optionally CSS\n\n- Your customized Formats are saved and sync'ed to all your logged-in Chrome desktop browsers\n\n- Works with both free and premium Asana accounts\n\n- No extra login/authentication required\n\n- Uses your Asana selections (read-only) but does not modify/write anything in Asana\n\n- Also: Update Dates/Triage Dialog: Fast and flexible natural language setting of Start dates and times, Due dates and times, My Tasks Sections, and multi-homing, with configurable shortcuts (unlike primary reporting functions above, this *does* modify your Asana content)\n\n- Asana2Go was created by Trilogi Solutions (http://www.trilogisolutions.com). We provide Asana Consulting and Integrations/Custom Software Development using the Asana API, in addition to easily-imported Asana2Go custom Formats for your particular needs.\n\n\nWHY ASANA2GO?\n\nDo You Ever Need To:\n\n- Copy from Asana to an email, document (or anywhere else)?\n\n- Make a nice-looking PDF from Asana, or a printed page/report?\n\n- Create ad-hoc or recurring CSV or JSON?\n\n- Turn your Asana tasks into an interactive slideshow?\n\n- Import from virtually any mind map app and export to a Coggle (https://coggle.it) mind map?\n\n- Work with others who are not using Asana and want to use the full power of Asana for yourself but not be hampered when it comes time to share with them?\n\n- See the detailed contents of more than one task at a time?\n\n- Work easily with your Custom Fields?\n\n- Do all of the above in custom tables (even interactive ones), lists or any layout of your choice?\n\n- Address these same pain points that these nice folks here have encountered? https://community.asana.com/t/printing-my-tasks/1236\n\nAsana2Go Can Help\n\n- Asana2Go addresses these and other needs and empowers you to design and create your own solutions as well\n\n- It operates in your own browser alongside your own Asana page; there's no separation or multiple-step processes as with some other tools/approaches\n\n- Many of us may never want to leave Asana, but sometimes we have to, either to address others' needs who may not be using Asana, and even sometimes for our own purposes when we need a slightly different view of our content to what Asana provides"
