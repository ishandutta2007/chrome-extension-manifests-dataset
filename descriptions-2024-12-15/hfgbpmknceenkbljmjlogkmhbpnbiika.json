[ 9 ] to set the position at 0 .. 90% of the duration,\n    - [ Home ] to set the position at the start,\n    - [ End ] to set the position at the end (think of it more or less as a stop button),\n    - [ Space ] / [ k ]to play / pause the sound  (or [ Ctrl ] + [ ↑ ]),\n    - [ p ] to \"pin\" the current position (the sound will now start from there each time it is played) (or [ Ctrl ] + [ ↓ ]).\n\nShortcuts behind parentheses are provided as alternatives for when the main ones are not available.\n\nThis can happen for example when a \"keyboard-aware\" word bank is available for the current challenge.\n\n[Limitations]\n\n- The extension is deeply tied to the inner workings of Duolingo, meaning that significant changes on their side could (temporarily) break it. If that happens, you can either:\n    - wait for me to fix it (you can open an issue on the support page if there is none about it yet),\n    - if you're a developer, try to fix it yourself, then open a related PR on the development page.\n- Due to hard limitations with the underlying technology (sounds are not accessible via Ajax requests, preventing us from using the Web Audio API), the volume can not be raised over 100%.\n\n[License]\n\nDuolingo is a registered trademark of Duolingo, Inc.
