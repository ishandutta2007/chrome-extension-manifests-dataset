The first year of the Historical Calendar is 10,000 BC. Year 2024 AD is year 1,2024 in Historical Calendar, but in most cases you can omit the first digit. \n\nThis means you can use Historical Calendar only when dealing with ancient history. Your day-to-day life is not affected, thus no official calendar reform is needed for Historical Calendar to be practical. \n\nAlternatively, you can use any other timeline by picking the starting point yourself. \n\nThe extension can potentially detect and convert all BC dates, even those that lack “BC” label. If some date is not being detected you can fix that using tools provided by the extension.\n\nIt can also detect and convert dates of the Common era, but only those that have “AD” or “CE” label next to them."
