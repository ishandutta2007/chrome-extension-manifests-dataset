To save you time we recommend to use the shortcut to jump to it (Mac: âŒ˜ + l // Windows: Ctrl + l or Alt + d or F6) \n2.- Type \"@\" + Tab (to activate) the custom search engine.\n3.- Add the terms/keywords for your search + press Enter.\n4.- Refine your search using the Google commands. This will allow you to filter on specific sites, exclude sites, words, combine searches, filter results by filetypes, etc...\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD USE IT?:\nEsri has dozens of domains (*.esri.com, *.arcgis.com, terraformer.io, ...), besides those from international offices (*.esri.es, esriuk.com, esri.ca, ....), which makes sometimes difficult to find all resources related to any topic.\n\nEsri also provides multiple search engines, but none of them include third-party curated domains like employees personal blogs, Github accounts, etc. \n\nBecause of this, sometimes it is difficult to find all , and that's why we started this project.\n\nRELATED INFO:\n1) More info about Google search commands:\n- https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-search/#advanced-google-search-tips\n- https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en#\n\n2) You can also add this Programmable Search Engine manually.
