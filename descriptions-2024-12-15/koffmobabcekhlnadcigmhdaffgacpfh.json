It inexplicable does not follow the width of the window to make use of as much screen real-estate as possible and lights-off mode still leaves a bunch of distracting gunk in the background. This extension hopes to address some of those issues by user agent spoofing to make use of the html5 player and hijack the video play/pause signals to:\n\n- clamp the video width to the width of the window while maintaining aspect ratio (<video> already does this, it just wasn't being used).\n- hide the watermark\n- hide everything but the video and controls during playback\n- vertically center the video during playback.\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words (probably more than that of mine), check out the screenshots for before and after."
