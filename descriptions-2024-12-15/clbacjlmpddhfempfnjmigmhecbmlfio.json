Like its predecessor, KyberLock does not use servers that might compromise your information. Everything is done offline. \n\nKyberLock stores nothing secret, not even in your device.\n\nWith KyberLock, you can: \n- Write messages than only the intended recipient can read. \n- Do this without having established a secret password. \n- Lock files and images as easily as text.\n- Establish a real-time peer-to-peer chat involving text, files, audio, and video\n- Digitally sign text, images, and files so others can be sure they come from you. \n- Convert your favorite email or texting app into a secure communication channel. \n- Hide private information as apparently innocent text, or inside images. \n- Use Decoy mode, so your true message is not what it appears to be. \n- Create messages that can be read only once. \n- Communicate across platforms, even without a network.\n- Send confidential mailings to several people at the same time. \n- Use a borrowed device in case yours is bugged. \n- Be as paranoid as you like. We are really paranoid, and this is why we developed KyberLock. \n\nKyberLock is built on the recently standardized Crystals-Kyber encryption method, based on the math of Module Lattices. Unlike current methods, this method is expected to be safe against quantum computers for many years to come. On top of that, KyberLock uses 256-bit XChaCha20 encryption to complete the locking process. XChaCha20 is a high-performance, open source cipher, which has been scrutinized by experts for nearly a decade without any practical weaknesses being found.\n\nThe first time you run KyberLock, it helps you to come up with a strong text-based secret Key, which can be whatever you want it to be. KyberLock places no restrictions to make sure that you can always remember your Key without ever having to write it down. \n\nFrom your secret Key, KyberLock creates a Lock, which is a piece of random-looking text that you give to the people you wish to send messages to you. They will \"put your Lock\" on those messages, and only your Key, which you have given to no one, will be able to unlock them.\n\nThis is the Chrome app version of KyberLock, essentially identical to the versions released for computers and mobile platforms. In addition, there is a pure html version of KyberLock at: \nhttps://kyberlock.com/app\n\nIf you want to check it out, you should save that page as HTML only, get the SHA256 of that with an external program or web page, and compare it with the value below. This is not necessary for app store versions like this one, which are code-signed by the app store.\n\nThis is the SHA256 for the single-file html version of KyberLock 1.0.1:\n1024-6687-b546-9561-7eb4-0527-311a-cfbc-e8bc-e6c8-ed4b-a51b-4acd-85b8-e153-baab\n\nWatch the developer reading this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUYE_6gBuLo"
