After you put in each word, Reportle will tell you what some of the best words would have been to guess next (strategically). At the end, Reportle tells you what its most optimal solution would have been.\n\nAlso includes a \"cheat mode\", where Reportle will tell you, given your current grid so far, what the next best guesses would be, without you having to have finished the puzzle.\n\nPlease note, this game is meant for hard mode Wordle players. You can still put in a regular mode grid, but all of the suggestions are based on hard mode.\n\nYour score is calculated based on three factors: word frequency, letter frequency, and letter positioning. At the end, you will receive feedback letting you know which of these factors you need to improve on.\n\nTo note, although the answer must be input beforehand (unless in cheat mode), this is only in order to determine the correct colors to display and is not used by the algorithm its its solution.\n\nIf you have any questions or algorithmic suggestions, please email at gamessimpleextension@gmail.com."
