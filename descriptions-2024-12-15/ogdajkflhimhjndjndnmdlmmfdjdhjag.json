You have to have the extension installed so it can log process data. \n➛ When two students are collaboratively working on a notebook, the extension records each student’s process separately on their own devices, unaware of the changes made by another student.\n\n📌 Terms and Conditions\nBy installing the extension, you agree to and acknowledge the terms and conditions at https://processfeedback.org/terms/\n\n📌 Privacy Policy\n➛ The Process Feedback extension collects the edit history of a Colab notebook so the process report can be shared as a link. Collected data is stored only so that users can view reports with the process report link. Also, collected data are deleted after six months, and the links expire.\n➛ For co-edited notebooks, always obtain permission from all co-authors before viewing or sharing process reports.\n➛ If your notebook contains sensitive information and you do not need a public link, please select the “Download process data” option and load the downloaded data to view the process report locally.\n\n📌 Please Cite\nAdhikari, Badri; “Thinking Beyond Chatbots’ Threat to Education: Visualizations to Elucidate the Writing or Coding Process”; Education Sciences; 2023. https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/13/9/922"
