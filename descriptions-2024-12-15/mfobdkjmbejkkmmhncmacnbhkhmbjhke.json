Twitter) user with just a few clicks.\n\nDesigned by the engineering experts behind Beliefs, this extension offers a refined yet user-friendly approach to tipping tokens. \nTipping tokens is an exclusive feature of coins launched at Beliefs that allows users to tip each other on Farcaster and X (prev. Twitter). \n\nWhen a token is created, token creator might opt-in for \"Airdrop\" feature, where users are granted with allocation after a token is launched to Uniswap. Allocations are calculated based on the token holdings. Those allocations are not claimable by a user, instead he's offered to tip his allocation for a recipient to claim."
