Fishy Buttons can help!\n\nMess up websites and distort objects with the Fishy Buttons. You can make any website amusing! (not guaranteed)\n\nQnA\n____________________________\nWhat does the off/on button do next to each fishy button?\nClick that to toggle the effect on so that it will load the effect every time you open a webpage. As new things load on the website, the effect is applied to the new content only.\n\nWhat is Fishy?\nFishy is that cute face you see on the icon. He is a fat floppy fish that wants to help you become amused. Click Fishify to put him in any website.\n\nWhat do the buttons do?\nFishify - Replaces all images and the background with Fishy.\n\nFishify Extreme - Make Fishy the background of every element.\n\nFishify Text - Replaces all words that start with the letter f to the word fish.\n\nSpinfish - Spin images! The slider will adjust the speed.\n\nEarthquake - Violently shakes all the images and text. Click again to pause.\n\nImage Corrupt - Will corrupt all the images on the page. Sometimes it will break the image completely.\n\nColour Filter - Will make the page extremely saturated.\n\nRewrite Text - Fetches all the text on the page and uses a markov chain generator to rewrite all the text on the page.\n\nFishfacts - Changes random paragraphs in a page into a random fish fact.\n\nJumble Page - Randomises the order of things on a page.\n____________________________\nFun Ideas-\nUse the fishfacts button and then rewrite text and you will see more weird sentences lol.\n\nTurn on fishify text on someones computer and don't tell them. Watch them get confused over excessive fish words in the page haaaaha.\n____________________________\n\nUpdate 2.5 -\nAll new design for the buttons.\nFishify text button is now more intelligent, it will keep punctuation and words ending in ed or ers will become fished or fishers. \nEffects will now update when the page loads more content.\nBug fixes and stuff.\n\nUpdate 2.4 -\nAdded Jumble Page button.\nRewrote code for \"Rewrite Text\" button so text stays the same amount of words.\n\nUpdate 2.3 -\nAdded Image Corrupt button.\nAdded Colour Filter button.\nAdded 40 more fish facts.\nRearranged the buttons.\n\nUpdate 2.1 -\nRewritten the entire thing because it was terrible.\nOptimised the code to work better and do the things in a better way.\nRemoved the gust of wind because it was stupid.\nFish all text button is now Fishify Text and does something slightly different.\nEarthquake pause/play is gone and now you just click the button to pause and play.\nToggle now works perfectly.\nAdded Fishfacts button.\n\nUpdate 1.3 - \nUsed bootstrap for popup window.\nAdded toggle buttons to each button that will make that button run automatically. (well it doesn't seem to work as well as it does in the development mode sorry)\nAdded ability to play earthquake after pausing and improved pause icon.\n____________________________\n\nHave fun!"
