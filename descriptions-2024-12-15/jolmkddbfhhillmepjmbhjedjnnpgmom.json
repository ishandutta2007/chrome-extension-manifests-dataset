You can also paste that list of urls to open them all in new tabs.\n\nSpecifics on usage:\n1. It checks for links, one per line\n2. Links must be the only thing on the line\n3. Links are identified by starting with 'http' or containing '://'\n4. Anything not matching link criteria is ignored (i.e. title lines)\n\nPermissions:\n1. Tabs and Browsing Activity -- required to get the list of open tabs.  Does not check for anything else.\n\nInspired by \"Tab-Snap\", which graciously provides its source code.
