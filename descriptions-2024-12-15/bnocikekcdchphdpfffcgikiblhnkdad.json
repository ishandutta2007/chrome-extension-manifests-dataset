And it's annoying to switch between them every time you receive a Google Meet‚Ñ¢ link or open Gmail‚Ñ¢.\n\nWith the Default Account Manager for Google‚Ñ¢ products, you can, for example, set up work accounts for Google Meet‚Ñ¢ and personal for Gmail‚Ñ¢, etc. \n\nSave yourself precious time and frustration by using our extension. \n\nüóÉ Default Account for Google‚Ñ¢ products is a fully open-source project under BSD 3-Clause License. \nVisit our GitHub page: https://github.com/uptechteam/default.wtf\n\nüîê We respect your privacy and don't collect any data (NO data is sent from your device), so there are no worries about security.
