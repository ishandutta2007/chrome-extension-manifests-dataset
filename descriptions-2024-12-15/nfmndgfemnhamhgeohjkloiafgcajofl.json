This extension collects data about the websites visited and evaluates how closely each site relates to the user's specified topics. For each browsing record, it assigns a relevance score and visualizes the results in a comprehensive report. The service provides insights into the user's focus patterns, offering a clear understanding of how effectively they stayed on topic during their learning sessions.\n\nThe primary goal of MSG is to help users maintain focus during their learning sessions by providing clear feedback on how their web activity aligns with their set objectives. By analyzing and visualizing browsing data, users become more aware of their habits and can make informed decisions to improve their focus and productivity."
