Say goodbye to losing your place while reading online!\n\nThe first core feature is a smart underline that automatically follows your cursor as you move it across the text, giving you a visual guide to keep you on track. Whether you're reading long articles, textbooks, or complex documents, this underline subtly guides your eyes without being intrusive. If you take a break, the underline disappears after 10 minutes of inactivity, ensuring your screen remains distraction-free.\n\nKey Benefits:\n\n1. Smart Underline: Follows your cursor in real time as you read, keeping you focused and organized.\n2. Automatic Idle Detection: The underline fades away after 10 minutes of inactivity, ensuring a clutter-free reading experience.\n3. Seamless Integration: Works across all websites, PDFs, and any other text you read in Chrome.\n4. Minimalist & Customizable: Tailor the underline's color, thickness, and style to match your preferences (upcoming feature).\n5. Future Enhancements: We’re just getting started! Upcoming features include tools to highlight text, save notes, and improve overall readability for a seamless reading experience in your browser.\n\nWith Reading Assistant, you no longer need to scroll back or search for where you left off. Enjoy smooth, distraction-free reading every time you browse the web."
