No \"recommended videos\", no \"related videos\", no comment, no likes, no side ads, no distractions.  \n\nThis helps prevent binge-watching videos and going down rabbit holes. This way, when you need to watch a video during your work-period, you can do so without the risk of getting distracted through videos that would show up on your YouTube dashboard. \n\nRight-click YouWork anytime for the option to pause. Click the YouWork icon anytime, to use a popup version. YouWork redirects to https://tash-had.github.io/YouWork/\n\nFor any issues, contact me at through the form here: http://t-saqif.com/hello\n\nYouWork has absolutely no association with YouTube, and is simply a tool to enhance productivity."
