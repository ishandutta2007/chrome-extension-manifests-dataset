It is unrelated to my work and is not related to any UCSB department. This extension could be written by anyone with any level of permission, including no permission and no UCSB affiliation. \n\nFor UCSB Students.\n\nThis extension automatically checks the UCSB GOLD Login checkbox agreeing to the following...\n\n\"By selecting this checkbox I certify that I am the individual to whom the above credentials were issued. I understand that logging in with another individual's credentials may be grounds for disciplinary and/or legal action.\"\n\nBy installing this extension, you agree by default to this statement each time you open the URL \"https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/gold/login.aspx\".\n\nGOLD Check now redirects students only to \"Home.aspx\" when on \"EmulatePage.aspx\". This is for students with a higher level registration access who are bothered by the redirect to \"EmulatePage.aspx\" after login.\n\nVersion 1.1 now checks the box when you are redirected to the page. This slipped by me before.\n\nVersion 1.2 now redirects through \"EmulatePage.aspx\". Now more robust with redirects and  varying URLs.\n\nVersion 1.4 Redirects only students from Emulate Page to Home\n\nVersion 1.5 Now the app only checks the checkbox on login and loginpermpin. fixed bug caused by html change"
