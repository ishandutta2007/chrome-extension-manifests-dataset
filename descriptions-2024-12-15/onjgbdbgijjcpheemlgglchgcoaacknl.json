Any other site and service under Eurofurence that is NOT on the main website (address does not start with www.) is not supported.\n\nDisclaimer: This addon merely provides help and does not lift your responsibility to observe the Eurofurence website and other official channels for information relevant to your planning. No responsibility is assumed for missed information."
