Fixed issue where clicking Meet Kicker didn't work on a new tab. Added error messages to help diagnose issues.\n\nðŸš¨ This is not a hack. You need to have permission to kick people already. This is just an app to make it quicker & easier to kick other people. ðŸš¨\n\nâš  May need to restart Chrome after installation\n\n1. Click on the Meet Kicker extension icon to kick someone at random\n2. Keep kicking until you have no friends left"
