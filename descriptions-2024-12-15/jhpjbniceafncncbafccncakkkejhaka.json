This extension will mute those ads automatically and give you peace.\n\nIf you are watching a supported on-demand program or a supported live-tv channel, your Chrome tab will be muted when an ad begins playing. Note this may not work on all live tv channels, as some tv providers stream their own ads and we can't detect them. However, it does have pretty good success with on-demand content.\n\nIt DOES NOT work on all live channels as each station handles ads slightly differently. It SHOULD work on most on demand programs and SOME live tv.\n\nWe will work to improve the coverage across more live tv stations as time permits."
