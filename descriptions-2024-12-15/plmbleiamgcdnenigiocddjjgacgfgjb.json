On top of that it uses a bunch of heuristics to determine a real website country, which often can be reliably guessed by the HTTP headers the website responds with.\n\nThis information is then presented in accessible way using either your OS native emoji or the beautiful emojis by Twemoji.\n\nIt's 2024. Cloud adoption is projected to only increase over the coming years. Every single website owner nowadays has gotten access to an affordable global CDN infrastructure provided by many cloud platforms. Yet, all other country flag extensions still rely solely on IP address country detection. It's time to get smarter than that.\n\nThe extension does not store any analyzed information and it never leaves your device."
