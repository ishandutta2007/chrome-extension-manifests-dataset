It is specifically designed for those with low vision who use screen brightness and color inversion for better visibility. However, such inversions can make photos look like negatives, reducing their appeal and making them harder to view.\n\nWith the Smart Invert feature enabled, ZoomText and Fusion's Color Enhancement effects—Invert Brightness and Invert Colors—are smartly managed to maintain the natural colors of photos. This integration ensures photos retain their original appearance, despite the inversion effects.\n\nFor Chrome users to benefit from this feature, two steps are necessary: first, install and enable the Smart Invert add-on; second, use ZoomText or Fusion while browsing. The add-on is inactive without these software solutions running."
