I have an existing Airtable that I use to research/create/develop designs, this is a perfect companion tool for it I prefer to keep them seperate because my design base is shared with my designer and VA, so my sales and listing data is seperate and private.\n\nI also use the data in this base for my advertising, to track reviews and I know it will be great for finding the next TOS violation when/if Merch has changed adopted to its current TOS, as the listing data is pushed directly from my listing so it will always be up to date!\n\nThanks for a great tool, Rick!!\n\nMARY MASLIAH\n\nSeptember 13th 2018\n\n\n\nI seriously can't even express how wonderful and incredible Merch Wizard is. I had been using airtable for quite some time but, it became very difficult to always update my spreadsheet. With the Wizard automating all of that, it has been nothing short of a miracle and easier to manage my listings!\n\nMy productivity since getting this tool is been as high as I remember it. All the extra features are wonderful too, but even the base feature for me is a lifesaver. I can't even imagine anyone doing merch above tier 500 not using this! I am seriously very thankful that this tool came out, it may have changed my merch journey!\n\nThank you to the Merch Wizard!\n\nFLAVIO MEDEIROS\n\nSeptember 30th 2018\n\n\n\nAbsolutely incredible - this is the tool I have been waiting for!!\n\nIn less the time it took to watch the setup video, I literally had every single one of my Merch shirts recorded in Airtable along with ALL of the sales history (# of shirts sold for each listing, reviews, revenue and royalties and much much more.\n\nTHIS.IS.GENIUS.\n\nThank you so much Rick!\n\nJON NEVEU\n\nSeptember 5th 2018\n\n\n\nI am loving MerchWizard! Even as an airtable noob, I'm finding MW easy enough to use and put into action right away.\n\nIt's the best organizational tool for MBA by far. The scaler tool is awesome and will save me a ton of time in creating and uploading listings.\n\nI can't wait to see what they come up with next, Thank you Rick Blyth and team for making this amazing tool available to us!\n\nCALVIN OHARA\n\nSeptember 30th 2018"
