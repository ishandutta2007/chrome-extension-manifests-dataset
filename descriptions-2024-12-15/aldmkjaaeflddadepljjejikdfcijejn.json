The slope is helpful in finding the equation of line through slope-intercept form and point-slope form. This slope finder will give you the result of:\nSlope of a line\nAngle of a line\nX-intercept of a line\nY-intercept of a line\nGraph\nNow you can get access to an online slope calculator by downloading its extension to avoid searching for a slope calculator or entering the URL of the tool. This extension is helpful for students and teachers to learn and understand how to evaluate the slope of a line.\nYou have to click the extension of the slope calculator and a pop-up screen will appear."
