Even when fields are not available on any form. Quickly view and edit Power Automate Flow definitions.\n\nHow to use:\n- Click the extension button when viewing a form to open the current row in the Dataverse Web Api and prettify the output!\n- When viewing a 'solution-aware' flow in make.powerautomate.com, use the extension to open it in the Dataverse Web Api. Click the Edit Flow button in the top right to edit your flow definition! This is very convenient for renaming actions/variables or as a last measure for working around bugs, when the default flow UI just doesn't want to cooperate (Power Automate developers will relate to this).\n- When already viewing a row or query in the Dataverse Web Api, just use the extension to prettify!\n\nYou no longer need to open your solutions to view the values for your Option Sets/Choices. Simply open the row and prettify the output.\n\nBrowse to related rows for quick insights using the 'Preview' button on lookup columns.\n\nUpdate columns of a row by using the 'Edit this row' feature. Update text columns, Option Sets, numbers, lookups, etc. Very convenient for modifying data that is not available on a form. You also have the option to impersonate other users, skip custom plugins and skip Power Automate Flows when updating a row.\n\nCreate new rows by using the 'Create new row' button.\n\nBrowse related rows by using the 'View relationships' button. When viewing related rows, use the 'Disassociate this row' button to disassociate the row from the parent/related row. \n\nQuickly copy the contents of a column to your clipboard by hovering and clicking the copy button.\n\nYou can prettify single rows, but also the results of your OData and FetchXml queries."
