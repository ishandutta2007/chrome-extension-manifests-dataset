This tool allows you to search stackoverflow.com instantly by copy-pasting your error directly into the search bar. If you prefer typing your error, go right ahead! Note: You no longer need to keep stackoverflow.com in your bookmarks. By simply clicking the enter button without inputting any text, you will be instantly transferred to the official website. This project is still in development and we are looking for constructive feedback. We are open to adding anything new to this project in order to provide developers with the tools they need to work quickly and efficiently. Very excited for this project launch, hope you enjoy!\nDisclaimer: This project is not affiliated with stackoverflow.com in any way, this is just a simple tool made to easily get help with code/projects."
