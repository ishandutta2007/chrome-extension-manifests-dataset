We realize what a pain it is to switch back and forth between Social Profiles, Groups, Messaging Apps and an external customer resource management system (CRM). GroupTrack removes that friction and brings all CRM features directly WITHIN the Social Media platform itself!\n\nCurrently, GroupTrack CRM is fully integrated with Facebook™ and Instagram™, with more platforms on the way in 2023.\n\n* Know everything you want to track about a potential customer without having to go somewhere else to look them up.\n\n* Enhance your Facebook™ and Instagram™ feeds and DM's with indicators to know who is in your CRM or not.\n\n* Hover over contacts to instantly bring up full CRM profile details directly on the page.\n\n* Tag someone from anywhere and have your email autoresponder react immediately with an outbound message!\n\nWORKS WITH TEAMS\nShare everything across your Team in real time. Split up incoming leads, prevent redundant follow-up, or duplicate your efforts with an assistant. As the account owner, you get to decide who is on your Team and what they have access to! Assign follow up Tasks to team members and have that activity tracked in the CRM.\n\nCONTACT TRACKING\nTrack Leads and Members anywhere in Facebook™. Get visibility into each customer's interactions with your community wherever they are. Contact Stages, Tags and Notes help you keep everything organized and searchable. Create follow up Tasks so you never lose someone through the cracks.\n\nRUN ANYWHERE ON FACEBOOK™\nTrack prospects anywhere conversations are happening around your product or offering. Works in any Group, on any Page, in Messenger, Personal Profiles, News Feeds, Events, Friends Lists...you name it!\n\nGROUP REQUEST CAPTURE\nFor Groups you DO own, never lose Member Request information again. Approve membership requests, capture access questions and update details in the CRM with a single click. Automatically parse out email addresses and/or phone numbers your members provide you when they ask to join your Group. If you want to validate that the contact has access to your Group first, just grab their member entry details to the CRM with one click and approve them to the Group later. All answers to Group Entry Questions are fully searchable in the web app.\n\nSTAGE PROCESS TRACKING\nQuit guessing! Utilize our fully customizable Stage Tracking system so you know where each member is within your unique prospecting, sales and customer retention cycles.\n\nMESSENGER SNIPPETS\nCreate dynamic templates for commonly used chat messages. Easily manage conversations that lead to meaningful engagement and sales! Log outbound messages from any Team Member in the Contact's profile. Plus, filter your Messenger Conversations based on who has or hasn't read or responded to your messages, or by Stages, Groups and Tags. It's never been easier to manage your Messenger!\n\nMONITOR POST COMMENTS\nKeep track of call-to-action Post responses automatically. React and respond to comments, add the commenters to the CRM, configure how to track & tag them, and even send them a Messenger Snippet automatically.\n\nAVAILABLE EVERYWHERE\nAll of this and MORE is fully accessible both from within Facebook™ via this Chrome Extension, as well as everywhere else through our secure web app. Data is kept in sync in near-realtime and without the need for page refreshes.\n\nSYNCHRONIZE DATA\nYou can also synchronize contact data with external CRM's, Google Sheets or to a Webhooks endpoint! Updates are made in near-realtime as you interact with contacts from anywhere.\n\n\n*** GroupTrack CRM is not affiliated with Facebook™ or any other Social Media platform in any way ***"
