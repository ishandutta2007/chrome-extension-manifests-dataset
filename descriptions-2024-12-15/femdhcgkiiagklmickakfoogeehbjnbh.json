From one prompt you can receive infinite amount of suggestions.\n\n\nYou can test the tool here: https://txtboo.com/type or any other website with textarea (doesn't work on Medium, Twitter, and some other places yet because they are handling text input different way)\n\n\n\n\nHappy using ☺️ and stay tuned for updates"
