Once you're on the webstore, switching locale takes you back to the home page, so you need to search all over again.\n\nThis extension stores your locale when you choose it, and thereafter always redirects you to that site regardless of which localised version you were sent to. You can change your locale at any time using the interface on the website, and this will normally allow you to stay on the same page.\n\nThis extension also stores your last \"View All\" or \"View less\" interaction with a product list page, and uses it to automatically \"View All\" on any product list if that was what you did last.\n\nAlso makes the instagram viewer modals link to people's instagram accounts.\n\nNow works on the Forge World website too (\"View All\" preference is shared across both sites, but language preference is not)"
