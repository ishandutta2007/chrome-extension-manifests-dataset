Provided as part of Don Crowther's 3xSocial course at www.3xsocial.com.\n\nThis extension's primary function is simple -- it will add a new button in the top right of your browser window that when pressed, will show you your list of blog accounts. Selecting one of them will make the extension do three things:\n\n1. copy the title of the current webpage and insert it into a new blog post.\n2. take the website's URL, pass it through bit.ly.com and provide a \"Read More:\" link in the new blog post's content area.\n3. Optionally, you can also ask the extension to take a snapshot of the browser window, which is then automatically uploaded to the media manager in Wordpress and inserted into the content area for you.\n\nThe concept is brilliant -- the extension makes it really simple to curate a webpage, whilst the WordPress plugin continues the process by then allowing you to share your new blog post to various social media outlets, with as much of the work as possible being done for you automatically. \n\nSetting up your blog account(s) is simple - all that is needed is the login URL (which looks like http://www.myblog.com/wp-admin), and the username & password of an admin user on that site. You can set up as many blog accounts as you like.\n\nRestrictions: the 3xSocializer for Chrome extension will only connect to a blog with the 3xSocializer plugin for WordPress installed, which is available at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/3xsocializer/. This is a commercial plugin which requires a licence key. Read more about the 3xSocial course by Don Crowther at www.3xSocial.com.\n\nInstallation:\nIf you already manually installed the previous .crx files from your hard drive, you will end up with two 3xSocializer extensions, so uninstall the previous copy from the Chrome Extensions page."
