This speed is also remembered across the site.\n    - There is also some text below the video which displays the current playback speed relative to the base 1.0\n    - Spacebar will play/pause (before it would scroll. It still scrolls if you are not focused on the video!)\n    - The play button is now centered (apparently the position property is animated in the css so it makes a funny floating animation towards the center)\n\nQuizzes\n- Once you've answered a question, you can now press Enter or Right Arrow to continue to the next question (before you could press enter to submit an answer but not go to the next question)\n    - These keys (enter and right arrow) can also start a quiz if you are on the main page of one.\n- Quiz inputs no longer have autofill! This should prevent giant annoying walls of autofill suggestions.\n- The first input box in a quiz (that's not hidden -- since there's a few hidden input boxes) is now focused automatically at the start of a question, to make it easier to tab through things"
