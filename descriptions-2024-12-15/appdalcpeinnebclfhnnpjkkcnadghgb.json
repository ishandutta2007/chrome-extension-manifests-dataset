Itâ€™s a dark room, and you have no idea what time it is. Hours pass like minutes, and shady figures follow your every move along the garish carpeting.\n\nInstall this extension to hear what the web really sounds like.\n\nThe sounds represent the third-party trackers and advertisers like Google Analytics, Facebook, and Twitter, chiming in as they follow you around and monetize your behavior.\n\nTurn off your ad blocker for the full effect.
