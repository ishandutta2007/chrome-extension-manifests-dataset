Just ask the assistant and let the assistant guide you through the activity.\n\nOnce it it is plugged in, you can view it on the right hand as UDAN. Click on the same, it will list out various options. First you notice a search text box. You can click on the 'mic' icon and just speak your query. If the tool has a solution, it will pop it up for you. All you have to do is click on 'play' and let he tool guide you through. \nIrrespective of which website you are on, the tool will try to guide you through. You can ask queries like \"How do I change my password?\" or \"How do I list invoices?\" or \"How do I see this months report?\"\n\nOh! The tool did not find a solution to your query? You can go ahead and create your own flows. \nPlease go to \"Advanced -> \"record new sequence\". Once the tool is in 'record' mode, you can go ahead and click in the target application as you normally would. Then give it a name and save. <Placeholder for 'record' video>. For example you are from the IT Admin department and would like to see the new requests for the hardware/software and any tickets that are in your priority list, You can create a sequence to record these steps. That's it  Once it is saved, you can use the search option and use the keywords or the name given to find the sequence created, and use the play icon to play the sequence. Cool! Isn't it?\n\nMore Cool stuff:\n1. This is an open source (License AGPL) project with source code available here: https://github.com/Digital-Assistant\n2. If you like it, you can deploy it in your organisation for free. (Please contact support@nistapp.com for paid support. )\n\nLimitations: \n1. This is beta release and will work for most 'modern' websites using frameworks like React and Angular. \n2. This does not support sites built using iFrames - i.e. Microsoft Dynamics etc.\nTutorial Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz2WgKY0fhc\nTutorial Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0_MNfBnYfM"
