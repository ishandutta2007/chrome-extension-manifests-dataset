However it is natural reaction to clutch you seat armrest when the plane drops 30 feet while you're flying 500km/h through the air at 35000 feet altitude. It's not a thing we evolved to enjoy.\n\nDespite the recent spat of incidents regarding Boeing planes and their whistleblowers mysteriously ending up dead, flying is still super safe. There is a 1 in 11 million chance of ending up in a fatal plane accident and that probability is decreasing every year.\n\nFear of flying is not a logical thing.\n\nThe statistics will actually tell you that those planes are safer than you'd think.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't some airlines or aircrafts to probably avoid. For example, the Boeing MAX models seem to have been brought to production without due QA, according to whistleblowers. I'd try to avoid those if possible.\n\nThis extension helps you quickly get the statistics on the airline and aircrafts involved in your journey so you can book with peace of mind."
