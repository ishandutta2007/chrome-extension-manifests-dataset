Your feedback will be more helpful to the person receiving it, making you a better people manager. Often, evaluations can be riddled with bias (we all have biases ) - Upful helps you check your language to eliminate these biases and gives you more confidence when you submit feedback.\n\nWant your manager to use this (on your reviews) but don't know how to approach them? Let us help!\n\nUpful works on top of popular HRIS,  performance management, employee experience, talent acquisition, and applicant tracking systems. It also works on top of social media platforms, communication and messaging systems, project management, and productivity websites.\n\nTo use the Chrome Extension, you must also make an Upful account.\n\nWe are always expanding what we coach on and trying to make it more effective and accurate. If you think we should be catching something, let us know! language@upful.ai\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor HR / People Leaders & DEIB Leaders:\n\nBuilt using behavioral science and nudge theory, Upful is scalable, private, non-accusatory training for employees (and especially new managers).\n\nUsing Upful will help improve talent development, engagement, and retention. Upful cultivates a healthy culture of feedback. We can be part of your overall DEIB strategy. Data shows that many employees have a perception of unfairness in their performance reviews and decisions around hiring, salary increases, promotion velocity, and even exists (layoff, termination, and turnover). Biases show up in performance reviews and in the language people use, which impacts career progression. We help improve the language and quality of a review, so decisions can be more equitable.\n\nInterested in the analytics and insights? Connect with our team.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nData Privacy\n\n- We do not sell data to anyone\n- You can turn the Chrome Ext on/off on certain websites or we can set it at the company level\n- We ask users to volunteer optional demographic data - this helps us improve the coaching and customize it for you. We do not share this with your employer.\n- Any data that gets shared with your employer's HR admin team will be in aggregate. If there aren't enough people in a group, we won't share the data at all.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your patience! We are a startup, trying to make the workplace more inclusive and equitable. Once in a while, you may experience some technical difficulties. Please reach out to us if you have any feedback or testimonials!"
