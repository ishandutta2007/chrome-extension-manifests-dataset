This extension enables you to use the Context Menu (right click menu) in Chrome to conduct single or group searches for selected text. Most useful scenarios are when you need to search a File Hash, IP Address or Domain across multiple websites at once.\n\nThe only requirement is that the Website you are searching provides a way to send parameters either using GET or POST requests. This extension supports both mechanisms. \n\nThreat Analytics is focused on using information to make decisions during event analysis about assets in your organization. During our work with customers, our analysts often use the same websites repeatedly to gather information about File Hashes, IP Addresses, Domains etc.\n\nAlso integrates with RSA Security Analytics, NetWitness Investigator, and Carbon Black.\n\nAlso supports encoding when the website you are using for your research requires Base64 encoded parameters.\n\nThis extension is fully Open Source under Apache 2 license and developed/maintained on GitHub here https://github.com/AdvancedThreatAnalytics/threat-analytics-search"
