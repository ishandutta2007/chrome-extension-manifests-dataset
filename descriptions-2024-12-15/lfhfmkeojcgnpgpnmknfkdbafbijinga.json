This extension removes those unknowns. By visualization of grid elements, it builds up your intuition in laying out the content, helps with identifying sizing and alignment problems at glance, and ultimately improves the overall development time.\n It’s simple to use. Just one click and you’re provided with a list of Bootstrap grid elements present on the page. By clicking on any of those, you get a visual overlay over that element. By another click it’s possible to extend the overlay to viewport height and use it as a generic ruler.\n Overlay itself is not just commonly placed. It aligns with the grid element precisely, which means it works with more complex nested grids as well.\nFurthermore, overlay gutter sizes are a true reflection of the underlying grid element. Any change of gutters initiated by use of Bootstrap classes will be reflected in an overlay.\n\nFeatures:\n-  provides visual feedback on grid elements ( container & row )\n-  helps with troubleshooting issues like an alignment or sizing\n-  saves development time\n-  works with nested grids\n-  reflects gutter changes performed via default Bootstrap classes\n\nNote: Extension works with default Bootstrap Grid only. Use of customized Bootstrap grid classes / elements will break compatibility."
