When the initial duration has been met, you'll get an alert offering you the opportunity to stop or snooze.\n... To use, you'll simply provide a portion of the URL (domain) you'd like to time your time on, and provide delay and snooze durations.\n\n# Situational Examples\n... If you find you've been spending a little more time than you would prefer on your favorite social networking site.\n... Or perhaps you'd like to be mindful when you're on your favorite shopping site.\n\n# Installation\n... Click the \"Add to Browser\" button above.\n\n# Installation Note: Chrome Browser\n... As of July 2020, after installing a browser extension, the Chrome Browser **hides the extension's icon by default**. In order to see the badge counter and badge colors on the TMT extension's icon, after installing, you will need to open the Chrome extension panel (click the puzzle piece icon on the toolbar), find the TMT extension, and click the pin icon.\n\n# Browser Compatibility\n... Although there can be some nuances (and bugs), browser extensions available from the Chrome Web Store are also available for other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Comodo Dragon, etc.\n\n# Chromium-based Browser References\n... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Active\n... https://www.quora.com/Can-Chrome-extensions-be-used-in-other-web-browsers-How"
