Therefore the extension replaces the default new page with the calendar. Each time you open a new tab, the calendar will be shown  to remind you of your own mortality.\n\nFrom Seneca to Steve Jobs, Leo Tolstoy to Charles Darwin, high achieving individuals use a hyperawareness of their mortality to accomplish more and live better.\n\nStuck in a rut? \nEndlessly procrastinating?\nHeld back by the fear of failure?\n\nBeing aware of your mortality may sound scary, but it’s an extremely effective catalyst for reflection and change. It puts all the things that don’t matter into perspective, melts away fears, and clears a path for you to focus on what's truly important.\n\nThe ritual of filling in a new square each week will jolt you into the present moment, provide you with an improved perspective on life, and give you the motivation and drive to take action week after week.\n\nProvided a wrong date of birth?\n-> simply do a left click on the extension and click on the reset button afterwards\n\nWhich resolutions does it support?\n-> optimal with 1000 pixels in height and above"
