It implements RFC4226 (HMAC-based OTP) and has been tested to work with Google Authenticator, Dropbox, Dreamhost and Amazon.\n\nNot just to secure your GMail account, but also extremely helpful to tighten the security of your SSH connection as instructed at http://www.mnxsolutions.com/security/two-factor-ssh-with-google-authenticator.html\n\nInstructions: Enter the secret you have been given by the service for which you want to have the OTP generated. Acccount name is whatever you want to remind your secret by, eg. the site name or email address. The generated 6 character key is the response you will need to enter when asked for. Be aware the time on your desktop or phone should be synchronized. When this is off by a minute it could fail to login.\n\nIf you are using Google, do not use an application-specific passwords to generate a response. They are not meant to be used this way.\n\nPlease let me know about any problems before you make a review in the store since I cannot answer you there. Send a report  email or report the support page. You can find the contact info in the about dialog or navigate to the support page.\n\nNo data is transmitted. All token secrets are stored locally in localStorage. Online version available at http://gauth.apps.gbraad.nl Community created application. Not affiliated with Google.
