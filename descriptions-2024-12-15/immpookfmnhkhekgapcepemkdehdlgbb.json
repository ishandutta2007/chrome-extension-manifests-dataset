You can see games for the remainder of the week or set a custom date range.\n\nLook out for more functionality coming soon! This will include a variety of tools to help you win your fantasy hockey pool this year!\n\nNote: You may need to force refresh your fantasy hockey website to get it work the first time after installing. To do this try Shift-Cmd-R on Mac or Ctrl-F5 for Windows. If this doesn't work, you can always try restarting chrome as well or toggling the extension on/off in chrome://extensions/"
