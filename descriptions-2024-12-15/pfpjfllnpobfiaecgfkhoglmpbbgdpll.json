Conservative groups protested this move, claiming that, for instance, groups that opposed same-sex marriage weren't necessarily hate groups.\n\nThis extension adds the information back to GuideStar. You're encouraged to click the links to SPLC and make your own decisions, but we think that more information is better, and many of the groups identified have viewpoints that are inarguably hateful."
