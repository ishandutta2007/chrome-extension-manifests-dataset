Enjoy a better experience with time tracking in YouTrack!\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\n- Automatic issue detection in YouTrack\n- Easy-to-use stopwatch timer\n- Tracked times are stored in YouTrack\n- Filter detected issues\n- Search all issues in YouTrack\n- Restart recently tracked issues\n- Delete tracked Work Items\n- Connect and switch between different YouTrack accounts\n- Lightmode and darkmode\n- Works even if YouTrack is closed\n- Extension in the style of YouTrack\n- 100% private. We do not collect your data!\n\n➤ AUTOMATIC ISSUE DETECTION\n\nYouClock automatically detects issues opened in the current browser tab. This works in all common views such as the Single Issue View, the Issue List and the Agile Boards.\n\n➤ STOPWATCH\n\nThe current issue can be tracked with a simple START-STOP timer. The work type can also be set straight away. All tracked times are saved in YouTrack (Work Items), therefore your data is available for Reports, Timesheets and Estimation/Spent Time caluclations.\n\nClocked in too late? No problem! With YouClock you can adjust the start time of the current issue at any time.\n\n➤ FILTER & SEARCH\n\nYouClock's issue selection provides a filter and search functionality, which is particularly useful in the Issue List and Agile Boards. It allows each issue to be targeted quickly, even with a large number of issues. If your issue is not visible within the current window, you can search all issues of the linked YouTrack account at any time, inside as well as outside of YouTrack.\n\n➤ RECENT ISSUES\n\nYouClock loads a history of past Work Items (Spent Time) into the extension, making it quick and easy to restart or delete recently recorded issues.\n\n➤ ACCOUNT SWITCHING\n\nDo you use YouTrack for work and for organising your private life as well? With YouClock you can easily manage your tracked times in different YouTrack accounts. Link as many accounts as you like and switch between them with just a few clicks.\n\n➤ THEMES\n\nToggle between light mode and dark mode and adjust the design of YouClock to your YouTrack Theme.\n\n➤ ABOUT US\n\nOur motivation was to create an intuitive and straightforward tool for time tracking in YouTrack, which unfortunately lacks an intuitive way to automated time tracking itself. Other third-party applications either do not have a sufficient connection to YouTrack or they save the recorded times separately and not in YouTrack itself. With YouClock, your tracked times are also available for Reports, Timesheets and Estimation/Spent Time calculations.\n\n➤ CONNECT TO YOUTRACK\n\n1. Login to YouTrack.\n2. Generate a new Permanent Token in you YouTrack profile (Profile > Account Security > Tokens > Click \"New Token\") and copy the Token.\n3. Connect to YouClock with your domain (e.g. example.youtrack.cloud) and your new Permanent Token.\n\nAttention:\nMake sure your administrator has enabled \"Allow all origins\" in the Server Configuration!\n(https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/server/server-configuration-settings.html#resource-sharing-settings)"
