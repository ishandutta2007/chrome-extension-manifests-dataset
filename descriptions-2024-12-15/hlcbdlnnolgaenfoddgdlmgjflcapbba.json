Always keep a backup of stored keys somewhere secure.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nThe extension allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages with PGP in-browser as opposed to by using a mailing client.\nYou can store your PGP keys directly in-browser for the purpose of decryption.\nIf you do not have PGP keys, you can generate them in the extension. Remember to also store them elsewhere for backup.\nYou can keep an 'address book' of known public keys for encryption purposes.\nWant to decrypt a message fast? After selecting an encrypted PGP message, right-click anywhere on the page and choose Decrypt to decrypt instantly! Feature customizable in settings.\nDon't like such information being stored in a browser? You can tweak storage settings in the extension options.\nWant to export your key databases? You can download them in a comfortable .json format.\n\n\nNavigation\n\nWant to store/generate your PGP keys?\n    Navigate to My Keys -> Enter Existing or My Keys -> Generate new accordingly.\n\nWant to view/delete your credentials?\n    Once your credentials are stored, you can navigate to My Keys -> Show my info or My Keys -> Delete my info.\n\nReady to decrypt?\n    After you have entered/generated your PGP keys, you can decrypt any message that was encrypted using your public key in the Decrypt tab.\n\nWant to encrypt a message?\n    Just store a public key that was given to you by going to Encrypt -> Add. After you have stored a key that way, you are ready to encrypt! Just choose a key from the list in the Encrypt tab. You can also view your 'address book' in the View Stored Keys found in the Encrypt -> Add tab.\n\nSearching for options?\n     You can find them in *My Keys -> Options*. There, you can enable/disable storage of your PGP keys and 'adress book' during every session."
