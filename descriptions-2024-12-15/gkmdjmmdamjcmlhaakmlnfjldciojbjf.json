The interface will be familiar to users of the Unity Editor, we've incorporated similar components like hierarchy and inspector panels so that you can debug a Playable Plugin build in real time just as easily as you would a Unity scene.\n\n\nHow to get started\nInstall the Luna Debugger Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store\nOpen a Playable Plugin develop build in Chrome\nUse the keyboard shortcut Option + âŒ˜ + I (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + I (on Windows/Linux), to open the Chrome DevTools panel\nAt the furthermost right of the DevTools tabs you should now see Luna, click this to open the debugger\nOnce the Luna Debugger is displayed in DevTools, you should see the hierarchy and inspector panels populated with information related to your scene in the develop build. What youre seeing is a live representation of your builds object hierarchy in the Luna engine.\n\nAdditionally, most of what you see in the inspector panel is editable in real time and we provide tools to move freely around the scene and pause it.\n\n\nHierarchy Panel\nHere you can see the full hierarchy of all game objects in your exported build, you can click game objects to open them in the inspector panel and expand child objects. The hierarchy panel is useful for a number of reasons whilst debugging your build:\n\nDetermining whether a game object is instantiated and active in the scene\nDetermining whether a game object is a prefab\n\n\nInspector Panel\nThis is where youll find the values and attributes that apply to a game object in your scene. All the fields displayed in this panel are editable and any resulting changes can be observed instantly in the running scene. Viewing and editing game objects here can useful for the following reasons:\n\nActivating disabled game objects\nChanging the position, rotation and scale of an object"
