Google has a feature where you can group tabs together (you can create a group by right-clicking on a tab and selecting \"Add tab to group\"). I use this feature heavily and I often have many groups each with a set of tabs related to the group name. When I switch from my laptop to my desktop or any other computer I have to re-open all of the grouped tabs which can take a while and is an overall hassle. So I made this extension to help with that.\n\nUse:\nWhen you click on the extension it opens a popup allowing you to select a group to save or load. The save table shows a list of all the current groups (even groups in other windows), pressing one of the buttons will save the corresponding group. Clicking any of the buttons in the load table will load that saved group. The X next to each load button will delete that group. Pressing the clear button will remove all saved groups."
