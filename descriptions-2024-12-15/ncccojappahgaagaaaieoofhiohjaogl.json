This extension also automatically presses \"proceed to video\" buttons. Currently works for ProjectFreeTV, Gorrillavid, DaClips, MovPod and watch-series-tv. \n\nPlease note that the video is outdated and the button in the upper right corner has been removed (things happen automatically now....which is a lot more  convenient) \n\nIf you would like this extension to include other sites, please leave a review and request it there."
