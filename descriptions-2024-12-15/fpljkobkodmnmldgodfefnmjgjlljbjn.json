You can also temporarily disable personalization for presentations or public spaces.\n\nThis product is not made by Google and has no official association with Google Photos.\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\n=====================\nNew in version 1.0\n\nFixed infinite loading error when rate limited.\n\n=====================\n\nNew in version 0.99\n\n- Switch to Manifest V3\n- Clean up the UI styling\n- Substantially reduce extension size\n\nNOTE: the extension may take some time to load your album/photo data on initial load, as well as when loading an album for the first time.\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.26\n\nChange disconnect account text to match Google Photos UX guidelines.\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.25\n\nFix for showing photos when account isn't connected or personalization is disabled.\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.24\n\nBug fixes for unexpected errors when no data is returned from API requests.\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\nNew in version 0.23\n\nFixed\n\nAlso fixes a bug where reconnecting an account had to be done twice.\n\n------------------------\n\n\nNew in version 0.22\n\n- Add ability to disconnect an account from inside the extension\n- UX changes to match Google brand guidelines\n- Better onboarding when no previous install is found\n\nAlso fixes a bug where reconnecting an account had to be done twice.\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.21\n\nGoogle has sunset the Picasa photos API so this switches everything over to Google Photos. This should resolve any reported issues around seeing a constant \"loading\" screen, or not being able to update album lists.\n\nFor the most part the experience should be the same, but due to the changes necessary this will require reconnecting your account once you upgrade, and you'll lose your local configuration. Sorry about that!\n\nOther minor changes:\n\n- Photo quality should automatically update based on your browser window size\n- All album links now take you straight to Google Photos instead of Picasa\n- Fixes a bug where the extension stopped working if you had a very large number of albums and photos\n- Prevent creating duplicate history entries\n\nThis is a pre-release for a major upgrade towards what I'll eventually call version 1.0.\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.20\n\n- History mode! Now scroll through the last 10 photos you've seen.\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.19\n\n- Allow toggling how images are fit to the browser (zoom versus contain)\n- Options UI overhaul\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.18\n\n- bug fixes when using the extension on multiple devices\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.17\n\n- prevent common video thumbnail types from showing up\n- add rate and donate buttons\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.16\n\n- add ability to hide/show album info\n- add compact controls mode\n- fix a bug causing extension to break after photos are removed from albums\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.15\n\n- add ability to easily copy / save images using the browser's controls\n\n------------------------\n\nNew in version 0.14: \n\n- disable personalized photos temporarily from config page\n- faster image loading when personalization is disabled / not setup\n- better algorithm for choosing what photo to display"
