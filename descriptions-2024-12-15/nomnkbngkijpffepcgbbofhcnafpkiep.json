For example: https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/index.html -> https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/index.html\n\nOften when searching for docs or method, the search engine will drop you on the `latest` or perhaps some other random version of the docs which doesn't match up with the version of that project that you're using.\n\nThis extension solves that problem by letting you specify a preferred version. Currently supported sites: Airflow, AngularJS, Bazel, Django, Java, Laravel, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Python and Scala.\n\nSee full docs here: https://github.com/leos/DocVersionRedirector\n\nNote: This extension is still in beta. While on version 0.x, new versions may reset the site settings.\n\nNote: As new sites are added the extension will need to re-enabled with each update. Unfortunately there's not a good way to deal with this without enabling host permissions on all sites."
