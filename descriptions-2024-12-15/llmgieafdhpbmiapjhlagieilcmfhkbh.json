We also have a few improvements for when using Datto RMM.\n\nThese enhancements will improve your productivity using HaloPSA.\n\nNOTICE: Check the Options page to configure your Halo subdomain/tenant url.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1) Ticket lookup from the browser address bar.\nClick inside the Browser address bar and type \"ha\" then press <tab>. This will prompt for the ticket #.  Type or paste the ticket # and press <enter>.\n\nNOTE: Make sure to disable your pop-up blocker for your Halo URL.  This is the most common reason tickets do not open.\n\n2) Copy/Paste Ticket Number & Title along with URL with one click.\nSee image below for the new copy/paste functionality.  This will generate a friendly looking link.\n\n3) Recent Tickets Icon.  The HaloPSA Enhancements icon will display a list of the recent tickets that you've worked on providing quick access to them.\n\n4) If you are using Datto RMM, the Ticket link will show in the Alert view.\n\nPlease reach out to us with any questions/comments/issues/suggestions.  We are actively working on more improvements to the platform.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This software extension is not affiliated or associated with HALO SERVICE SOLUTIONS in any way. It is an unofficial, third-party browser extension created for improving productivity within our teams. Use at your own risk."
