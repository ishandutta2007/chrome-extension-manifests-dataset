Did the website add contents you didnâ€™t know about? The extension will notify you instantly.\n\nThis extension checks if webpages tinker with your clipboard. Is the contents of your clipboard actually what you expect it to be? When an inconsistency between your clipboard, and the text you've selected, is found, you'll receive a notification. \n\nSimple as that.\n\n---\n\nðŸ”§ Latest bugfixes (v1.8.0)\n\nâ€¢  Copying multiple snippets resulted in multiple popups overlaying eachother. Now, only one popup is shown.\nâ€¢  When copying from a rich text editor field (Google drive, TinyMCE, code formatted editors, etc.) false positives occurred.\n\nðŸ’» Open-source\n\nThis extension is open-source.
