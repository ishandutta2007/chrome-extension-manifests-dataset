Red means the price is due to go up, green means the price is due to go down!\n\nWhen you click the box you will see the price change history of that product (the date and the price it changed to), and you will be given some information such as the average time between changes, how long it has been since the last change, and how likely it is the that price will change tomorrow/will that change see the price go up or down? \n\nYou can choose to add a product to the favourites list by clicking the \"Add to favourites\" button, and see the favourites list by clicking the one next to it. Once in the favourites list you can drag and drop items if you want, say, Corn Flakes from Coles next to Corn Flakes from Woolworths. This way you can easily see where it is currently cheapest!\n\nPlease keep in mind, I do NOT have any inside information so I cannot say with 100% certainty when prices will change but given how most of the gou...pricing is of a cyclic nature, all it takes is a bit of maths to have a really good estimate. \n\nThis is just a hobby project. I am not a professional developer, I'm not even a computer science student - so it will not be perfect. If you find any bugs/issues, PLEASE let me know. I'm just a one man team doing this for free in my spare time so please bear with me. \n\nThanks!!!\n\nUpdates:\n22/10/24: Updating to V2.13\n- Manifest bug fixed.\n- Updated favouristes/dashboard.\n\n22/10/24: Rolling back to V2 (required to change number so V2.12) \n- Reason: Errors in a file stopped the extension from being installed and/or updated. Rolling back until fixed."
