When the user scrolls through their Facebook page, on the top right corner for every Facebook post, it would tag the news as verified and non-verified where non-verified is potentially fake news. It also works on twitter snapshots - checks if the user ever posted the tweet mentioned in that twitter snapshot, shared on Facebook or no. If the user did post that tweet, it marks the Facebook post as verified else non-verified. For pictures containing adult content as well, it would mark those posts as non-verified."
