Raising awareness is the first step towards putting a stop to this. \n\nMany brands try to hide their involvement through complex supply chains, making it hard for you to know if you’re buying into the problem. \n\nOur plug-in makes it simple with a pop-up that informs you when you’re shopping from a brand that has not publicly committed to disengaging with Uyghur forced labor. From there, you’ll be given the choice to keep shopping or to leave.\n\n \n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Checker's database is based off the Coalition to End Forced Labour in the Uyghur Region's advocacy and research efforts."
