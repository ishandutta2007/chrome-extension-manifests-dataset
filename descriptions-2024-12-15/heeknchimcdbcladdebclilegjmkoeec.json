The same details also need to be re-entered into a register in a slightly different format to submit to regulators. The time spent in these tasks can very well be used to serve a few more patients.\n\nTo use this tool, after you install it, click the extension icon and click 'Options'. Add the details of your clinic name, etc. This is a one time task.\n\nYou must activate the extension typically once a day, when you visit the PNDT form page (e.g. http://pcpndt.ap.gov.in/home/). To do so, click the extension icon and click 'Activate' when you are on the form page. The extension does not activate on other pages.\n\nDuring work, the tool automatically fills in known fields in the form, and highlights the fields that you need to pay attention to. This provides a confident visual cue that enables you to pay attention and know when you have filled in the required fields.\n\nWhen you submit the form, the record details are stored in your browser's database. You can download the records using the extension menu, and open the downloaded pndt.csv file in Excel and print them.\n\nFor privacy reasons, this tool does not store patient record details any where else other than your browser. This means that if your browser or computer crashes, the records can be lost. To solve this, the tool has options to download, backup and restore patient records.\n\nAfter every month, you may choose to delete the patient records from you browser, using the 'Delete Records' button in the Backup menu.\n\nCurrently, this tool has been tested to work for AP state. Please contact the developer if you wish to use this for some other state."
