When searching for flights on Google Flights, this tool provides a seamless, immediate visual cue that you are about to get on a recently engineered Boeing plane. The aircraft model of all flight listings that are scheduled to be serviced by a 737 MAX will be highlighted in red. In the wake of various incidents involving the 737 MAX, many passengers may prefer to make an informed decision about the aircraft they fly on.\n\nNote: This extension is not affiliated with Google Flights or Boeing. It is an independent project aimed at providing additional information for flight bookings. Support for other popular travel sites available in future versions."
