No chat or Twitch UI. Perfect for selecting streams to watch on your second monitor! EZ Stream Access also remembers the stream quality you selected in the popup. This saves you a few seconds you normally have to spend selecting your quality.\n\n- Clicking on the stream title or profile picture of the channel opens the normal channel page.\n\n- A click on the name of the streamer leads you to their videos page.\n\n- And a click on the game or category name opens the directory page."
