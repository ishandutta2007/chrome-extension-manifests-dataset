If your e-wallet developer has failed to address this serious vulnerability, unauthorized persons may gain access to highly sensitive data – such as your account password, or even your private keys – despite your best efforts to protect them.\n\nIt may surprise you to learn just how much data might be captured, simply by visiting a provider’s website. Very often, the website developers (or even the service providers, themselves) don’t know, either! But those who are experts at data mining and fishing are definitely up-to-date on the most recent solutions and technology available – and there is no way to determine exactly who is viewing your information. \n\nThose who are familiar with the most recent advancements in marketing know how to leverage the \"learn your customers\" industry – and you might be surprised how easy it is for them to gain access to your sensitive data, through the use of perfectly legal tactics and applications.\n\nvideo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vbBvmnDJpk\nsource: https://github.com/CORIONplatform/SafetyLook"
