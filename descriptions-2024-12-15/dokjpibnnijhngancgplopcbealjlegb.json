Do you wish it would just go away? Well you're in luck!\n\nThis simple Chrome Extension will remove Twitter/X's For You tab completely.\n\nRemove Twitter For You works if you have pinned Lists, as well. Normally, if you refresh the page from a pinned List, it will default you back to the For You tab. No longer will you be defaulted to the For You tab...because it won't exist!\n\n***Remove Twitter For You does not access your data in any way. It is automatically disabled outside of x.com. It does not have any settings or options. It's as simple and safe as a Chrome extension gets.\n\n(So far, this extension only works on Twitter/X in English.)"
