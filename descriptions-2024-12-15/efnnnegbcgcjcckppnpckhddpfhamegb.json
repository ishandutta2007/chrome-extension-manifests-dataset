Meaning that in fact this is not a bypass, but just another way to retrieve data that you ALREADY have access to. Keep in mind that you do not gain any new permissions by using this extension. Your user keeps exactly same roles, privileges and permissions - as documented here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions\n\nIf you are responsible for managing an Entra ID tentant remember that \"Using the Restrict access to Microsoft Entra administration portal switch is NOT a security measure.\"(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#restrict-member-users-default-permissions).\n\nIt works similar to AzureHound by BloodHoundAD, except you don't need to use a terminal for this and can run it directly on your Google Chrome.\n\nIn fact, even Microsoft official documentation states that the UI restriction does not restrict anyone, who has access to a tenant, from retrieving the information from Entra ID - find out more  on this article, which was written after reporting to Microsoft a strange UI behaviour on Azure portal: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/microsoft-azure-active-directory-authorization-bypass-vlad-yultyyev/.\n\nThis extension may be handy if you are a security professional who needs a quick solution to analyze Microsoft Entra ID tenant.\n\nYou need to be a user of particular tenant to view the content of that tenant.\n\nWhat can you expect to access using this extension?\n - Exactly same features/information that you can access through Graph API, CLI or PowerShell\n - List all groups that exist on the tenant\n - List all users and retrieve their information\n - List Application Registrations (names, URI, exposed APIs, roles, secret IDs, etc)\n - List Enterprise applications\n - List devices (names, operating system version, etc)\n - Create new tenants (an active Azure subscription is required for this action. Depending on your organization settings, only Azure AD B2C tenants may be allowed)"
