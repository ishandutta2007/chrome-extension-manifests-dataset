Features include a more modern design, fixed table of contents on the sidebar (no more manually scrolling to the top to find another heading!). Also has a more convenient search bar with larger search result items. Automatically opens an image in a lightbox rather than navigating away from the page to show the image.\n\nReadability enhancements include:\nChange in font (family, size, color, line-height and others).\nParagraphs now are indented and have larger margins/padding to give more breathing room\nImages also have more padding and border-radius\nImage captions now \"hover to display\" to give more of a minimal look\nTable padding significantly increased to give more breathing room\nAnd MUCH more!"
