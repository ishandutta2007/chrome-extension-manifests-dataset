More information about the proxy is available at https://sites.google.com/site/tjproxyaccess/home.\n\nOn websites where the proxy is in use, a pink key icon will appear in the address bar. When the proxy is off, the icon is grey. If this is annoying, you can disable it in the settings.\n\nTo disable the proxy for all sites, click on the pink key icon. The page will refresh and load through your normal internet connection.\n\nThis extension's proxy settings apply ONLY to Chrome, not to other browsers. This differs from the normal setup.\n\nThis extension requires the ability to \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" because that is the permission needed to control the proxy in Chrome.\n\nMore information, as well as the source code, are available at the linked Github page.\n\nObligatory note that this extension is in no way sanctioned by the TJHSST administration."
