You can then search them, tag them, comment them and link a code repository.\n\n💻 Automatically find code repositories using PapersWithCode's API\n\n🤝 Match pre-prints to publications using 4 different databases\n\n🎬 Change a pdf's webpage title to the article's title, because who cares about that saved bookmark 1812.10889.pdf when it could be InstaGAN Instance-aware Image-to-Image Translation.pdf\n\n🎫 BibTex citation, because citing papers should not be a hassle you can copy a BibTex citation to your clipboard or export the Memory itself as a .bib file\n\n🔗 Markdown link, [title](url) because it's the little things that make sharing a paper easier (to be used in issues, PRs, Readme, HackMD.io etc.)\n\n🗂 Direct download button with a nice name including the paper's title, so that you don't have to open the pdf's webpage and then download it from your browser.\n\n📄 Go back from a pdf to its abstract page. For instance: from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06907.pdf to https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06907 in a click.\n\n🏛️ Export your data as a .json file or a .bib full BibTex export\n\nCheck out more the code, documentation, screenshots and share ideas at https://github.com/vict0rsch/PaperMemory"
