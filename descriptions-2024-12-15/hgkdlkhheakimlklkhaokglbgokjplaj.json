Also, for videos without chapters, use your media keys to restart the currently playing video or skip to the next video that's up next. Finally, the current chapter title will be used instead of the video title on the mini player. This is great for single video music playlists, to see what the current song title is instead of the playlist video title.\n\nNote: Please go to this website \"https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode\" and make sure you have these keys available on your keyboard: 'MediaTrackPrevious' and 'MediaTrackNext'. The extension won't work otherwise!\n\nThis extension also doesn't change the way that playlists work on YouTube, you won't lose any functionality that you had before installing, besides the mini player video title being swapped for the currently playing chapter title on videos with chapters."
