Notyfy sees which platforms you're already logged in to. That means Notyfy doesn't ask you for your credentials or read out your cookies (it doesn't have the chrome permissions to do that). \n\nCheck https://notyfy.co for the current supported platforms—more platforms coming soon, stay tuned!\n\nNotyfy will check in the background in an optimised way if there are new notifications on your logged in and selected platforms. \"Optimised\" means the transferred data is kept to a minimum because it doesn't need to download the whole website, big images or load all the ads.\n\nWhen a new notification appears, Notyfy will add an unobtrusive \"1\" badge on the extension's icon. It will give you the relief that you haven't forgotten to follow up on things. Your aunt's birthday on Facebook? Your job inquiry message on LinkedIn? The reddit post you made and somebody replied 2 days later? You are covered for this and many other cases.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nYour data will not be transmitted, saved or sold.
