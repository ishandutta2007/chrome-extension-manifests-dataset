At its core, you create lists of airports important to you, either individual, or along a flight path.

Metam offers a side menu full of aviation weather charts and imagery. Current observations, forecasts, flight level winds and temperatures, satellite, radar, operations and more.\n\n3. You can now overlay global METAR, SIGMET, G-AIRMET and CWA data onto maps. Also radar/precipitation or IR satellite. Also, you can now enter custom ceiling and visibility minimums to quickly see airports that meet your personal or company visibility/ceiling requirements.
