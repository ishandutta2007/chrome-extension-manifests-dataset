Either PDF documents, the New Tab\n       Page, extension pages, Chrome pages, you name it.\n\n   Learn more about native extensions and their benefits here:\n   http://autocontrol.app/native-component\n\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n   Being a native extension demands additional development effort to\n   support each operating system. For this reason, Tab Thumbnails Switcher\n   is initially supported on:\n\n    • Windows 7\n    • Windows 8/8.1\n    • Windows 10\n    • Windows 11\n\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  PERMISSIONS  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n   When installing you'll see a message saying that the extension can\n   \"Read your browsing history\".\n   This is a standard message generated by Chrome. Tab Thumbnails\n   Switcher does NOT access any personal information.\n\n   Please read our privacy policy to learn more:\n   http://autocontrol.app/privacy-policy"
