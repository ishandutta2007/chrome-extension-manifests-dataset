ChromeOS captures state about the device and the environment, but this information is stored in text logs that can be difficult to interpret.  The Shill Log Processor reduces this barrier by summarizing the log, provides a visual representation of the WiFi services and interface and allows the user to navigate by clicking along with searching.  This is an early release tool focused on easing developer bug triage and debugging.\n\nIn this version (0.1):\nSupported files:\nChromeOS net.log (found at /var/log/net.log)\nChromeOS messages (found at /var/log/messages)\nChromeOS feedback submissions (system_logs files)\n\nVisualization Summary:\nEach manager has a graph if there are service state updates in that section of the log (this does not always occur).  For each visualization we have three graphs.\n1 - large service state graph over log time\n2 - smaller service state graph for context (can select a subset to zoom)\n3 - wpa_supplicant state\n\nTo use:\n1 - install extension\n2 - click on \"options\" link for \"Shill Log Processor\" in chrome://extensions)\n3 - bookmark the new page for future use :)\n4 - select a log file to process with the \"Choose File\" button (this may take a few seconds depending on the size of the log file)\n5 - if the logs contain shill service state updates, a visualization will be shown.  You can zoom in on portions of this graph by selecting (click and slide) from the smaller context graph.\n6 - links to full log lines are included in the manager and service summary sections (useful for click-navigating through the log)\n\nUpcoming Features:\n- support for other devices\n- improved manager summary (currently not duplicating information in manager and service summaries)\n- click in graph to navigate in log\n- hover relevant log details when mouse over graph locations\n- process logs in real-time for ChromeOS devices\n- detect relevant log files opened in Chrome and add icon to process the log"
