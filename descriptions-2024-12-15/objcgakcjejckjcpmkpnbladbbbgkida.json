Welcome to Advanced password manager. Here, we are tackling one of the main problems of having autofill enabled in our browsers, that is it doesn't ask our permission before autofilling our credentials. Wonder why it is a problem? It is because if I am a hacker who is intelligent enough, I will fool the browser to make him autofill without you noticing it which will result in breach. To avoid this behaviour, we add an extra step, a pin which you can will be asked before autofilling your password."
