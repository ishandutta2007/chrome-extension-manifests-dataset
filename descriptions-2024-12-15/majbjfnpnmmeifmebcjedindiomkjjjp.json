On top of saving time having to search between shows/movies, it solves a problem facing most Netflix users: your food's going cold and you can't decide what to watch. Clicking next allows a user to watch a show they know they want to watch (as it wouldn't have been added to the queue if they didn't) however it removes the indecision that comes with searching.\n\n- - - - - HOW TO USE - - - - - (Easiest to use when extension is pinned to taskbar)\n1: Ensure Netflix is open\n2: Click on extension icon, check off 'Queue' checkbox\n3: Select your shows/movies to queue by playing them, the extension will return you to browse page\n4: Once you are done queue-ing, uncheck the 'queue' checkbox\n5: Click the 'Next' button to view the next video in the queue\n6: 'Clear' will reset the queue"
