There are generally no or minimal limits on the number of messages you can send.\n\nSMS support limited to carriers (of recipient) listed in the extension. If no carriers listed, SMS service may be down.\n\nUnfortunately, this service doesn't offer option to supply a reply number or address for recipient to reply to. But you can put that inside the SMS message if needed.\n\nFor more details, visit http://www.watacrackaz.com/autosms\n\nI built this extension since the service provider didn't offer one, only offering a Firefox extension. Hey, Google Chrome is cool too! And this is my way of showing support.\n\nSource code for the extension has now been released, including the source for other platform versions. Get the source or AutoSMS for Opera, Safari, Windows 7/Vista, etc. here: https://github.com/daluu/autosmsclients\n\nYou can try to get support at the Github site link above. Bear in mind some of your support issues may be specific to the AutoSMS service provider rather than the extension, so then I may not be able to help you in that case.\n\nFYI, as a fallback, if this extension doesn't work for you or not to your liking, try Textbelter in the web store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textbelter/clciehobfheendclpnmbgbalelignpoa)."
