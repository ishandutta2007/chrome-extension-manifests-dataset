This extension adds a subtle, purple-tinted star background that gently animates across your browser window, creating a calming cosmic atmosphere while you browse. The animation can be easily toggled on or off with a single click of the extension icon.\n\nYou can customize where the starfield appears by managing allowed and blocked websites through the extension popup. Add your favorite sites to the allowlist to automatically enable the effect, or use the blocklist to prevent the animation from appearing on specific pages where you prefer to keep the original background.\n\nThe extension also includes a dark mode/reading mode feature that optimizes page contrast and reduces eye strain, making your browsing experience more comfortable, especially during nighttime reading. Toggle between standard and dark mode effortlessly to suit your preferences and lighting conditions."
