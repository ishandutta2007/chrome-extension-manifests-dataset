You don't have to go through lists of links searching for the one you need. You don't have to create comprehensive descriptions to remember what it was and why you needed this page. \n\nWith artwo, you save what you like and let AI bring you everything you need when you need it. \n\nFavorites \nAdd any web page to the repository. Add it to a specific space or multiple spaces. Add description. \nHave as many spaces as you need. Create your own hierarchy if you need it. \n\nAI-powered search \nArtwo AI engine will scan every page you add and defines important information you might be searching for. This includes dates, people, places, important topics, and key entities on the page. You don't have to remember everything or create a comprehensive description. AI will work for you. \n\nFlexibility\nYou can work with one link or many at once. You can work with links from different spaces at the same time. Open /delete/update links as you wish. You won't have to navigate from space/folder/tab to space/folder/tab. Everything will come to you. \n\nData security\nYour data is always encrypted during the transition to our server (HTTPS) and at the server (256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard). No compromises. \nData is replicated across multiple data centers.
