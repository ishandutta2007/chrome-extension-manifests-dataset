It allows you to read, edit, and manipulate records within one or multiple SQLite databases. The extension conveniently displays records in a table format, which can be further visualized through plotting or exported in CSV format.\n\nFor experimentation, the extension includes a sample SQLite database. Additionally, you can create one or multiple new databases directly in your browser's memory, enabling a seamless start from scratch.\n\nThe extension uses the WebAssembly (WASM) version of SQLite, enabling it to open databases using its JavaScript engine. With this approach, there is no longer a need for any native application to handle SQLite databases.\n\nOne feature of this extension is its blending of a Mathematica-like environment with NC (notebook computing), allowing you to have multiple computational regions within a single window. This setup allows you to run statements on different databases efficiently.\n\nThe extension has an internal plotting component powered by \"Chart.js,\" enabling you to visualize your records in formats such as \"pie,\" \"donut,\" or \"line.\"\n\nWorking with databases:\nYou can drop a database onto the interface to start working with it or inspect its table structure.\n\nNotes:\nThis extension operates entirely offline. There is no data sent or received from any external server, providing a secure and private environment for your SQLite database operations."
