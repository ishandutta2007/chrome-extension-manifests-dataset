This calls for discovering new techniques that may help us manage our time more efficiently. A bionic reader is a step forward in this direction. A bionic reading format is a relatively new type of typeface which has proven itself to be beneficial for users with neuro divergent tendencies. It involves bolding the first few letters of a word, thereby making it easier for readers to glide through the text and stay focused. The following work proposes an extension by which, users can seamlessly switch between their original content and the Bionified content of their active webpage and affect efficient reading techniques with in their browser."
