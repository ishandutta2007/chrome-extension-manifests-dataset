If you do, this chrome extension is for you.  When you install it, the user-friendly interface displays three easy steps for you to follow: locate the folders that hold your youtube bookmarks (my folder names are \"Music\", \"Music 2\", and \"Music 3\"), type in the names of those folders into the extension separated by a comma (\"Music,Music 2,Music 3\"), and finally, choose whether to listen to the songs in-order or shuffled and you'll begin listening to hours of music.\n\nFirst, disable auto-play on Youtube. Then, after you click the \"Shuffle\" or \"In-order\" button in the extension, a small window will appear and you can relax from there on out; the chrome extension will automatically select a new song and play it once the old song is over.\n\nv1.0 - Initial release.\nv1.1 - Fixed bug in v1.1 where songs were still duplicating.\nv1.2 (01/25/19) - Fixed bug where unavailable/deprecated/removed/country-blocked videos are automatically skipped and banned to assure they never reappear.\nv1.3 (02/02/20) - Completely refactored code and reduced pause time between song transition.\nv2.0 (06/01/20) - Reset versioning system to do it properly. Removed scrollbar removal feature and fixed some UI issues.\nv2.2 (06/02/20) - Added functionality to store a user's 5 most recent playlists. Also added error messages for empty bookmark folders/playlists.\nv2.3 (11/28/20) - Fixed a few bugs with error messages and button functionality.\nv3.0 (12/30/21) - Upgraded from Manifest v2 to Manifest v3\nv4.0 (05/25/24) - After experiencing multiple issues with Manifest v3 and multiple reverts, all issues have been resolved to avoid the extension being dropped in July 2024 due to the Manifest migration.\nv4.0.1 (05/25/24) - Fix a bug where users were not able to skip songs seamlessly.\nv4.1.0 (06/21/24) - Enable functionality to search over Other/All Bookmarks instead of just the Bookmarks Bar.\n\nThis extension is also available as a Firefox add-on : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/music-playlist-generator/"
