You want to post a comment for your colleague to look at but you don't want the pull requests contributor to see that notes. \n\nGitX allows you to add notes in pull request/issue pages and these are only visible to project collaborators and not any other users. This helps actual maintainers of the project to communicate with each other in GitHub itself.\n\nSteps to use:\n1. Click on \"Add to Chrome\" button\n2. Login to GitX account\n3. Goto GitHub issues/pull requests tab.\n4. GitX provides you with a â€˜Make Note', find it.\n5. Add a note and save it.\n6. \"Visible to collaborators\" option enable us to show the notes to other collaborators.  \nNB: The user should have the write access to the repository for creating notes."
