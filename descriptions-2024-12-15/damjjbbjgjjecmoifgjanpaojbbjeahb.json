Each day, when you open a new tab, Meloboard will ask what you are grateful for. Write one thing you appreciate in your life in that moment. Over the day you'll be reminded of this source of gratitude in each new tab.\n\nWrite something different each day and don't be afraid to be grateful for the little things. While you are always going to be thankful for your family, just writing “I’m grateful for my family” day after day doesn’t keep your brain working to find new grateful moments.\n\nPracticing gratitude can have an amazing effect on your wellbeing. By regularly reflecting on the things your grateful for you'll feel more positive emotions, foster better relationships, sleep better, be more compassionate and kind, it can even improve your immune system!\n\nMeloboard will also help you become more mindful. The \"Breathe\" button triggers a guided mindfulness meditation. You can choose to follow the captions or turn them off to practice on your own."
