Everything is repaired and working! If you still have problems, contact me at theac61@gmail.com, I'll be glad to help you out! :)\n\nWelcome to WriteUp, a free Markdown editor which is a Chrome app that tastes like GitHub (which uses GitHub Flavored Markdown and regular Markdown). You can visit the web app here: http://bit.ly/writeupeditor\n\nYou can download the app or use the web app, which ever is best for you. I made WriteUp because I didn't want to pay for any Markdown editors on the Mac App Store, eventually I found a free app but it only let you see the Markdown files.\n\n//  FEATURES //\n- Works online and offline - plus WriteUp is entirely free!\n- Runs right from the Chrome App Launcher\n- Looks pretty with its new minimalistic user interface\n- Open and save .md, .markdown, .html, .htm or .txt files!\n- Live preview with a side-by-side comparison (Markdown on the left, preview on the right)\n- Compiles Markdown straight to HTML\n\n// SOON TO COME //\n- options\n\n// CHANGELOG //\nVersion 3.0:\n- FIXED ALL PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE WINDOW, WINDOWS 8 AND THE AWFUL UI\n- WriteUp looks minimalistic, which is good\n- new Markdown parser\n- the U is capitalized\n- links in the preview now open a new tab in Chrome\n- added new items to the Edit menu (cut, copy, etc.)\n- severe UI improvements\n\nVersion 2.7:\n- all links actually open now (even in the About window)\n- fullscreen window for OS X Yosemite users (when you click the maximize button)\n- a friendly message shows when you hover over the maximize button\n\nVersion 2.5:\n- nothing big, just added something in the manifest\n\nVersion 2.3:\n- now supports .markdown files!\n- added a little menu item that detects your Internet connection (and updates it every 5 seconds)\n- improved the window control buttons\n- fixed the default window size\n\nVersion 2.0:\n- put on the Chrome Web Store and starting up this awesome changelog\n- added window control buttons (minimize, close, etc.)\n- improved welcome message\n- removed Options for now (I can't figure out chrome.storage)\n\nVersion 1.0:\n- doesn't exist\n- that's all we know :)\n\n(C) 2014-2015 theawesomecoder61"
