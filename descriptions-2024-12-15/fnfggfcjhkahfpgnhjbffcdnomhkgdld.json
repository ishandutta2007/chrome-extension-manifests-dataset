Unlike conventional productivity tools that require elaborate setups to keep you focused, Allowance believes in simplicity and user empowerment. At its core, Allowance provides a basic yet effective mechanism to control your time spent on distracting websites, encouraging a more mindful internet usage.\n\nWith Allowance, you're in control. The extension allows you to easily add or remove websites from your personal block list. Whether it's social media, news outlets, or entertainment sites that tend to eat into your productive time, you decide what deserves a timeout. And when you're ready for a break, Allowance lets you choose how long you can access these sites with preset timer options of 1, 5, 15, or 30 minutes. It's that simple—no frills, just focus."
