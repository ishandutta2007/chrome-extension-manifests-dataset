This is useful for things like /r/askreddit where you probably would like the thread to get upvoted so your comment has a a chance of getting seen by the masses. Karma!  \\m/\n\nMany, like myself, forget to upvote a thread when I'm busy thinking about my reply to it. This extension will provide a checkbox (defaulted to be checked) next to the reply \"save\" button that reads \"Upvote Thread\" if you are contributing a direct reply to the thread, or it will say \"Upvote Reply\" if you are replying to another reply. Simply leave it and reply and you will upvote the thread or parent comment. However, maybe you think the thread/parent comment is stupid and you're commenting to say that. Just uncheck it you Debby Downer. \n\n--------------------------\n\nLike this extension?
