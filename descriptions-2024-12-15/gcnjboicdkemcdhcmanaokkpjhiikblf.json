This did remove the functionality to verify only 1 settings page was open, but I felt the peace of mind from not requiring the permission anymore was worth it.\n -1.7:\n   All new settings page, thanks to @SoulExpression, and some backend to some interesting settings coming up.\n -1.6:\n   Everything is back to normal, except userIDs will no longer be shown by default, as they are no longer transmitted by default.\n -1.5:\n   Imgur did some huge rework on how the code is written, so I had to rip out everything except for the loading icon changing bit. sorry. should be working properly in about a week or so.\n -1.4.3:\n   I fixed some long-standing bugs (I couldn't fix them before as they were complex issues I didn't quite understand. I'm learning this as I go). The only errors that should be there are from problems out of my control (the settings not loading is a common one).\n   Resizing the loading icons is currently disabled until I figure out why it's broken\n -1.4.2:\n   y'know how the last changelog made it look like I did check everything? nope. streamlined the code a LOT more now (and it shouldn't spit out thousands of errors now, because I hooked an event to a function that indirectly fires the event, and yeah...) made the settings page display the version you're running, and it should actually work a bit more predictably now\n -1.4.1:\n   forgot to do through bugtesting. settings page should work now. favorite tagging broke with the optimization last time, I haven't fixed that, but it was useless for now anyways\n -1.4: \n   cleaned up a lot of the code, and streamlined it a BUNCH. I know a lot of people had problems with it locking up/eating all the memory. this should help a bunch.\n   cleaned up the tagging system, getting it ready for adding user-chosen tags\n\n\nNOT AFFILIATED WITH OR APPROVED BY IMGUR\n\nThis started out as an extension to replace the loading icons, but has become so much more. As of right now, it can: \n-replace the loading icons with any image you want\n-put a badge on imgur staff using their main acocunts in the comments\n-mark your own comments to make them easier to find\n-list everyone's author IDs (not very useful, but it's there!)\n-and I'm still adding features! like:\n -favoriting comments for later viewing\n -select multiple images to use for different size loading icons\n -gif preview in the side pane\n -any good suggestions I receive! (I can be contacted @ZacMuerte on imgur)\n\nExplanation of permissions:\nI received some complaints about how many permissions I request, so let me break it down, so you can understand I'm not being evil:\n -read all data on imgur: rather self-explanatory. I'm going to be scraping the page and then adding stuff to it, as well as modifying requests that it makes (the loading icon)\n -browsing history: this is where I get complaints. I use this permission to check if you opened a tab to imgur, that is it. if the URL does not contain 'imgur.com' I ignore it (I can't even touch the page anyways). there are ways around using this permission, but it would be rather clunky.\n -other permissions chrome doesn't warn you about: storage (to save your settings), webRequest[blocking] (allows me to modify where the loading icon is pulled from)"
