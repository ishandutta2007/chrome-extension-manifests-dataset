This is the place to generate a challenge code, or turn the extension on/off.\n\n- The selected metagame is displayed in the gen9nationaldex35pokes format. Every other format, like gen9nationaldexag, is unaffected by this.\n\n- Selecting another metagame is immediately reflected in the teambuilder.\n\n- Certain 35 Pokes metagames can customize data like Pokemon BST, typing, learnsets, abilities etc.\n\n- For past gen 35 Pokes metagames, the teambuilder and in-battle tooltips display the correct move data and indicate moves that were changed.\n\n- There is no performance cost for all of these!"
