Clip them all at once with a click of a single button! Currently supports Safeway, Albertsons, and Vons websites. Absolutely NO user data is saved.\n\nPlease leave a review with any feedback and I'd love to improve this tool to make it more helpful for you. This is a side hobby project that is FREE for all users. Alternatively, you may contact me through the contact section of my portfolio website: michaelhjung.com\n\nImportant: After clicking \"Clip All\" please make sure to wait until the text \"Clipping...\" goes back to showing \"Clip All\" before refreshing or closing the page. The software needs to finish going through each button to clip it for you. Enjoy!"
