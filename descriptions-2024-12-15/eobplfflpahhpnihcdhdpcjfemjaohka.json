This includes clicks, page views, form submissions, and other interactions. All of this data is then sent back to the server, where it is stored and can be used for a variety of purposes.\n\nOne of the main purposes of this process is to allow for functional testing of any store website that is using our app, Shopify Spot It. By recording all of the user's actions, you can test the functionality of your app on a variety of different websites and identify any issues or bugs that may arise. This can help ensure that your app is functioning correctly on a wide range of websites, which can improve the user experience and ultimately lead to greater success for client's website.\n\nOverall, the extension is a valuable tool for recording and replaying user interactions, as well as functional testing of any store website that is using your app. By installing this extension, users can gain valuable insights into how their app is being used, and can optimize their app to provide the best possible user experience."
