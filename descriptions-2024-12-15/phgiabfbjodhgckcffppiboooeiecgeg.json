It also re-calculates the token balances after refilling the missing prices.\n\nPhishing link warning:\nThe cute llama icon on your browser extension tool bar is an unintrusive indicator that will turn red when you are visiting a suspicious website, or turn green when you are visiting a trusted website. Be safe with the llamas!\n\nPrivacy:\nWe do not track you in any way in the extension, and we only request access to Etherscan and similar blockchain explorers, in order to inject llama token prices and wallet tags.\n\nTwitter phishing detection:\nWe detect reply tweets likely to be scams on twitter and mark them with a red background.\n\nExplanations for permissions requested:\n- Read and change data on all sites: Necessary to augment etherscan with wallet tags as we have to inject code on those pages, to add phishing detection on twitter. We request the permission for all sites so that we can easily add more as they are needed.\n- Read your browsing history: Necessary to read the current url where the user is in order to detect phishing domains and change extension icon to alert the user. Extension never reads browsing history but we have to request permission for it to be able to read current urls."
