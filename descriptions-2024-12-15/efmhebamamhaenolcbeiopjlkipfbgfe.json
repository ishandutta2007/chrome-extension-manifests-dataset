Users need to log at least once into each account to register them. This extension only works on forumactif domains such as forumactif.fr, forumactif.com, etc. User passwords are NOT stored.\n\nEasy and quick :\nTired of switching between your multiple forumactif accounts ?\nActivate this extension with just one click and your browser will remember and display your accounts for quick and easy login. No more hassle!\n\nSmart and safe :\nWith a clean, barely noticeable design, you'll only see it when you need it. It blends in perfectly with most forumactif websites. It does not store any confidential information, and especially not your password! Only your nicknames, avatars and userids are stored in your browser local storage.\n\nIt just works :\nThis extension works with most forumactif forums, including those with custom domain names. There is not accounts limitation, no requirements other than logging into each account at least once. Have fun !"
