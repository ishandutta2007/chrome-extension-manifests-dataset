This generated signature is then sent back to the extension.\n\n3. **API Call**:\nThe extension uses the received signature to make an API call to the Habbo servers, falsely representing ownership of a Avatar Collectible.\n\n4. **Access to Avatar Perks**:\nIf the API call is successful, the Habbo servers are tricked into believing that the user owns the Collectibles from me.\nThis grants you access to special avatar accessories, exclusive HC/BC Perks, and other benefits typically reserved for actual Collectible owners.\n\nIn summary, the extension leverages blockchain signatures from my backend server (which legitimately holds the Habbo Collectibles) to spoof ownership for you, allowing to bypass purchasing expensive Collectibles while still enjoying the same premium perks."
