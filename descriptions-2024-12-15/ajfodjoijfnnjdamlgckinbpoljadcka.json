But the sizes of tabs gets smaller and smaller in the tab bar as you open more and more of it. Once you open more than a few tabs, you can only see the favicon in the tab bar for all the tabs. It becomes very difficult to switch between tabs or windows when you can't read the title and 10 tabs of same website that have identical favicon are opened. Once you can't see the title you either have to click on tabs randomly until you bump across the right one or remember where every tab is and click right there. It's just too much hassle.\n\nTab tracker is an extension which takes all your windows and all the tabs in it, and categorizes them according to the websites and helps you switch tabs in 2 clicks at max. You can see the websites and titles no matter how many websites are opened."
