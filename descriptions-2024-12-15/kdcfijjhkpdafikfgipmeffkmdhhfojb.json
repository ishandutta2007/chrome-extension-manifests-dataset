Our inboxes were overflowing and our personal details were being bought and sold behind the scenes, leading to total inbox overload. \n\nWith a Nimble ID, you can keep signing up for the services you enjoy without sacrificing your inbox sanity or personal information. Get back to using your email for what it was intended for - personal communications. Use your Nimble ID for everything else!\n\nHow it works: \n\nThe Nimble Chrome Extension lets your create your very own @nimble.email address. After doing so, we'll give you a handy one-click button to populate your contact details on sign up forms. Messages are delivered straight into the extension for quick access, keeping your personal inbox clutter-free.\n\nWe'd love to know what you think. Feel free to reach us at hello@nimble.id"
