I can't count how many times it's helped me save something that later disappeared, or to identify connections between webpages.\" - Craig Silverman\n(Media Editor, BuzzFeed News)\n\n - Never take a screenshot again! Hunchly captures the web content you visit automatically, and makes it much easier \n to stay organized.\n\n - Stay focused on what matters - the investigation! Hunchly works quietly in the background, and with the blacklist and capture toggle, you can make sure you're only capturing what you need.\n\n - Page you saw got taken down? No probblem! Hunchly makes highly accurate offline copies in case the page you visited gets taken down or changed.\n\n - Protect against tampering! Every page, image, and attachment in Hunchly is given a unique fingerprint (\"hash\") at capture."
