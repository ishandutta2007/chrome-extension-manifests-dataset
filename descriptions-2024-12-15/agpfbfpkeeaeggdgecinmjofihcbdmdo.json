You can add custom URLs/RegExp through the extension's options.\n\nJust so you don't get fully locked into some kind of echo chamber, there is a link to allow one to access the blocked page.\n\nWhy?\n\nLots of businesses and websites big and small make their money by selling advertising space. It's important for them to produce and/or publish content that attracts viewers.\n\nSome of these publishing entities exercise a significant lack of journalistic integrity — nee, even a disheartening absence of respect for the general public — and present a form of content as polluting and rotten as '80s Troma-grade nuclear waste on society.\n\nObviously, each person to their own tastes. However, if you are an individual that wants to be a little more proactive in reducing the revenue these poor taste websites make, Quit Bad Journalism is a tool to catch and warn against the dangers of clickbait, tabloids, fake news and alternative facts."
