With Falcon, OWL loads over 65% faster on average. \n\nFeatures\n------------------------------------------------------------\n- Dark Mode!\n\n- Load pages without refreshing!\nWhen you navigate OWL, it will be much faster because a full refresh is not done every time you go to a new page. (This feature is disabled on Gradebook, Test/Quizzes, and Forum)\n\n- Edit course names!\nEspecially useful when you're just starting a new semester, and you're not used to the course codes yet.\n\n- New resources page!\nFalcon includes a brand new resources page for browsing your courses' files. It is extremely fast. You can search for any files/folders instantly, too!\n\n- New Announcements Experience\nScroll through all your announcements at once like it's your personal feed.\n\n- Powerful Falcon Editor\nFalcon also comes with a diagram maker/editor which you can use to design Flow charts, graphics content, and more. Each course gets its own editor so there's no compromise on your creativity!\n\n- Search and sort announcements, assignments, etc\n \n+ Many more features!\n\nOf course, the features listed here are the main features you can visually interact with / see on OWL. There are many minor enhancements to OWL itself that Falcon makes that improves the user experience. One of which is a more modern and updated look without taking away from the OWL you are familiar with.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFalcon is open source!\nhttps://github.com/RishabSwift/Falcon\n\nOnce you install this extension, it will work on https://owl.uwo.ca"
