MagicBrief is the fastest way to save facebook ads. \n\nSave ads from Facebook, Instagram and TikTok: With MagicBrief, you can easily save ads from both Meta and TikTok ad libraries using the Chrome Extension. The ads will remain in your library even when the brand stops running them.\n\nMagicAI: Leverage the power of artificial intelligence to automatically break down your saved ads into their individual scenes. Once you've broken an ad down, you can automatically create a new storyboard using the scenes.\n\nCollaborate and share: Share your ad collection with team members, clients, or colleagues, granting them access to specific folders or your entire collection. This is great if you're working with a team that you need to share ad inspiration with."
