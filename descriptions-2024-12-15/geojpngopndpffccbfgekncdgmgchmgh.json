You can modify any fields, add tags and when saving the bookmark the popup will disappear automatically.\n\nI wrote this small plugin since every other Pinboard extension at the time was trying to do more than just allow creating a new bookmark and I wanted to have as little clicks as possible.\n\nRequires access to all pages in order to support the \"use current selection as description\" feature.\n\nFull source code of this extension is available on my Github repository: https://github.com/aggregat4/chrome-extensions/tree/master/pinboard-save-bookmark\n\nChangelog:\n1.0.6 - Small typo caused a bug that prevented the popup from showing, should be fixed."
