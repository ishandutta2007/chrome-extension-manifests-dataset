Natively, there is no \"Delete\" option that will wipe out the selected records with one click. This feature will delete any of the selected records.\n\nShow Max Results: Show Max - on pages that list schema components like workflow rules, actions, and email templates, there is often a \"Show More\" link. This feature displays a maximum number of the possible results on one page with one click.\n\nChatter Chat: If Chatter is enabled in your org, a floating \"Chat Window\" appears in the bottom right hand corner of your screen. This can be turned on or off.\n\nVarious Profile Settings: At the field level, check or uncheck all of the \"Visible\" or \"Read-Only\" boxes. At the Object level, check or uncheck all of the CRUD/View All/Modify All boxes. For Tabs, quickly display or hide all tabs."
