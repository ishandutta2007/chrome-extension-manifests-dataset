You specify which pages to open and what days of the week to load them on. Then just click the Daily Link's icon and all of today's pages load in new tabs. This is great for keeping track of web comics, blogs, news, or any site you want to check regularly. This extension is inspired by the Morning Coffee extension for Firefox.\n\nNew in v1.5:\n - Removed unnecessary permission\n\nNew in v1.4:\n - Fixes clicking on the icon not doing anything\n - Fixes daily badge not showing up\n\nNew in v1.3:\n - Works now with new Chrome versions\n - Small style and security fixes\n\nNew in v1.2:\n - You can now choose to load tabs in random order.\n - You can now browse your bookmarks for links to add.\n\nNew in v1.1:\n - You can now choose to open tabs in the current window instead of a new window."
