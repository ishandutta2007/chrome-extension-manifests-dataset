The timer shows time to get ready, to do the work and to 'get done' /wrap up the work.  You can create time markers to show when to start and what you will need, your midpoint goal and end goal. There is a single tone to indicate get ready, 2 tones to indicate you are at the midpoint and 3 ascending tones to indicate you are at the stop point.  As time passes the primary color becomes more translucent to show that time has passed. This allows the individual to look back and reflect on how they used the time they planned to compare planned vs actual use of time. At the start of the allocated time block, a pop up box will display the steps of the task you outlined to occur during this time block.  When you are working on the internet you have the option of hiding the clock or showing the clock so that as you work you can be tracking the passage of time and compare actual work to planned time."
