That's it! Now look for places or directions.\n\nNEW: You can save commonly used addresses like 'Home' or 'Work', which would allow you to search something like \"home to McGill University\". \nTo save: Click on the Extension icon next to the address bar, and put in addresses.\nOr, go to chrome://extensions, find HashMaps, and click on the Options button. Note that you don't need to do this if you've already saved your Home/Work addresses in your Google Account. \n\nTO SEARCH FOR PLACES:\nSimply type in the name of the place, and press Enter. Example: \"McGill University\". Screencast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGTYNvsGLgU\n\nTO SEARCH FOR DIRECTIONS:\nType in the origin and the destination separated by a 'to', and press Enter. Example: \"Montreal to New York\". Screencast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGPeumO-d4\n\nMOTIVATION:\nWhile travelling in India, I often want to look up directions and places on Google Maps. But given that internet speeds are still somewhat iffy, the process is a pain. To look up directions, I have to first load maps.google.com, then enter locations, and then search. That extra step of loading the landing page significantly slows things down.\n\nBut that's not why I wrote HashMaps.\n\nGiven Chrome's excellent address bar - Omnibox - I now no longer have to go to google.com to search for something; I can just search from the address bar (this is of course also true for Firefox, but it sometimes craps out when it sees a colon: it thinks you're supplying a port). The process feels much more natural. That was the idea behind this extension. I use Google Maps on a regular basis, and the extra step of going to maps.google.com seemed unnecessary. I should be able to search for directions using my address bar, just like I use it for searching for other things.\n\nThat, and I'm lazy.\n\nICON CREDITS:\nhttp://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik\n\nWHAT'S NEW:\n- Saving Home/Work addresses!\n- New, snazzier icon, courtesy: Freepik\n- Suggestions! Start typing and see suggested locations. Don't worry, your search history isn't saved at all: all suggestions are created dynamically when you type by smartly interacting with the Google Maps API."
