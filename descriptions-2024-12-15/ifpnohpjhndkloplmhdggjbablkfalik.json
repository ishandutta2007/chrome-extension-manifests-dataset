Click \"Add to Chrome\"\n2. Accept the terms.\n3. Try to make a search, any search, with your URL bar.\n4. Click \"Keep Changes\", the button on the right side.\n\nWhen asked if you wanted to change your search engine, your first response may be to click the left button because it's lit up, but this is the wrong button. Click the RIGHT button, which is not lit up, because it says \"keep changes\".\n\n➤ Features\n* World class, entire web search results.\n* Conservative values baked in. Truth is non-negotiable.\n* No extension fluff (added tracking or bloatware)\n\n➤Full Web Search Engine\nOther attempts at conservative search engines are simply too small in scope. They may be useful for searching specific news events, but you only get results from those specific conservative news sites.\n\nOn Result Hunter, you can search for all sorts of things, just like you would search on Google or Bing.\n\nYour results are more likely to freedom-oriented.\n\nThat way you can search for products, services, definitions, and any other sort of information you want, but you'll more likely land on websites that support your values."
