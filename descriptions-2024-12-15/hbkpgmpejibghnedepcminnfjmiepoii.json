This extension simply makes it easier to use their website in a modern browser that assumes that every site should be https.\n\nSource code is available at https://github.com/73om/bomhttps/\n\nChangelog 1.1: Changes which chrome permission is used to transform the URL from declarativeNetRequest to declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess, which means the permissions declaration no longer needs to say \"Block content on any page\" as that wasn't what it actually did and made it seem scary."
