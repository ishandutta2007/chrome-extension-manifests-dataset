The internet is full of objectionable, crazy-making content. Images, articles, pictures, advertisements, comments, and videos can all drive us to fits of rage, or simply annoy us to the point that we wish they would go away.\n\nFor those times, there's Super Smash Browser.\n\nThis extension provides you with a menu of options for removing and defacing content that you don't like, in a safe way. Those three options are:\n\n- MAKE IT GO AWAY: click a button, and watch all an entire page disappear into nothingness.\n\n- MAGIC WAND: turn your cursor into a magic wand. Click on any element of a webpage to make it disappear. It's as simple as that!\n\n- HAMMER TIME: turn your cursor into a hammer. You may use it by clicking to smash up the content on a page. If you get angry enough at an element to smash it 5 times, it will be destroyed.\n\nAnd when you're done, if you want to continue viewing the page, simply refresh and all of your damage will be undone! Enjoy all of the fun of smashing stuff with none of the repercussions.\n\nTo use the latter two options, click the relevant button in our dropdown menu, then click outside the menu to activate your chosen mode.\n\nNOTE: Does not work on the Chrome Extension Store page! Go somewhere else to try it out.\n\nEnjoy!"
