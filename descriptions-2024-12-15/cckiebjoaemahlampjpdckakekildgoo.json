A confirmation dialog will prompt you so you don't accidentally list them without further review.\n\nThis is something that the existing solution from steam really lacks and slows down the process of listing a lot of items at a time so I hope this helps as much as it helped my friends and I!\n\nThis was made within 24 hours and the code is open source, I will push updates as needed to fix bugs and to implement new useful features that are requested or I think of!"
