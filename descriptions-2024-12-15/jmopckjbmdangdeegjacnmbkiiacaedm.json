With a simple click of the \"Auto Read\" button, you can effortlessly listen to the next reply without having to read it yourself. Additionally, the app offers the ability to re-read the last previously written comment in case you missed it.\n\nFor an even more enhanced experience, we also offer ReadX extension that enables automatic text to speech and can seamlessly move to the next page on websites like RoyalRoad. The ReadX extension also has the capability to read Reddit comments using different voices.\n\nWe believe that our easy-to-use text to speech apps can greatly improve your interaction with ChatGPT and your online reading experience.\n\n* Added support for the current version of Bard."
