All tabs except new tabs or \"special\" tabs are discarded. Discarded tabs are visible in the tab bar, but not loaded from the network nor kept in memory.\n\nIf a window doesn't have a new tab, it is created and activated. This prevents any tab from loading during startup, unless you explicitly select it.\n\nSpecial tabs are those with chrome:// URLs, for example.\n\nNote: Where there are hundreds of tabs open in the session, a couple of them sneak through and become active. This limitation is due to the design of the browser. See https://github.com/hrj/sloth/issues/1.\n\n## History / Credits\n\nI found an extension called Native Lazy Tabs here. It was distributed under the GPL license. I adapted it and added the \"new tab\" feature.\n\nThe icon is by Jaime Serra, distributed under the CC license."
