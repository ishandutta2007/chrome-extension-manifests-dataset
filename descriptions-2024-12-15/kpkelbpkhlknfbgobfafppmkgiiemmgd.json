Meet Weeklyer. \nForget about the \"zen\" of a pretty pictures, that's for dreaming about where you'll go once the work is done.\n\nWeeklyer is a tool I created for myself, so it gets straight to the point. It's perfect for people like me who can get a little distracted, focus too much on one task and forget about others, or simply lose track of tasks or notes written down in who knows which app. That’s why I find it helpful: I can see exactly my main daily tasks every time, and when I open a new tab, I can quickly write things down and have them right in front of me.\n\n⭐️ Features:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n💲 It's Free !!\n🗓️ Weekly Routine Calendar:: Add your routine by days and hours.\n  - Google Calendar:: Conect your GCalendar with Weeklyer\n✅ To-Do List:: For specific tasks you want to add. \n  -  📌Make them sticky if you need them more visible!\n⏰ Pomodoro:: Prefer to focus for 25 minutes at a time? Just hit the button.\n🔗 Quick Links:: Add links to your most visited sites.\n🕵️‍♀️ API Monitor:: (Maybe a bit personal) If you’re a developer who needs to monitor several systems, you can set up an endpoint and keep track of them here.\n🫸 GitHub Wall:: For developers who like to keep an eye on their streak.\n🛠️ Customization: Adjust the app’s appearance (some) and add extra widgets as needed.\n👅 Multilingual:: The main language is English, but I’ll be gradually adding more languages based on user feedback.\n\n\n🛡️ Privacy & Security\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWeeklyes is an extension that work in the \"new tab\" page. \nNo registration/login/signup/... is required. And the extension do not collect or share any data.\nDoesn't do any kind of user tracking.\nAll user settings are stored currently in localstorage, so everything will be safe as long as you don't share your computer.\n\n\nIn the future, probably will add more useful features, including the option to sign up and save your data in the cloud, so you can sync your settings across multiple computers.\n\n\n\n*Remember, I develop and maintain this extension in my free time. I’ll keep it free as long as it doesn’t demand too much time or money, and will respond to feedback and bug reports as quickly as possible in my free time."
