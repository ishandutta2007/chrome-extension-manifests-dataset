The player can control their character using the arrow keys to move in different directions. The player can also shoot fireballs by pressing the space bar. The objective is to avoid colliding with the robot character and the fireballs it shoots, as colliding with them will result in a game over. Additionally, colliding with the riddle master character triggers a riddle. The player must answer the riddle correctly to continue playing. The game has a simple graphical interface and basic animation effects."
