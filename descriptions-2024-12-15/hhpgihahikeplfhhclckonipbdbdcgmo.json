It provides three convenient methods for users:\n\nDocument Upload: Users can upload relevant documents, and the AI will extract the necessary information to auto-fill the form fields. For example, in a job application, uploading a resume will enable the AI to populate fields related to work history and education.\n\nText Input: For those who prefer manual entry, users can type in the required details, and the AI will organize this information into the correct sections of the form. This method is ideal when specific, detailed information needs to be provided.\n\n\"Selling iPhone 14 Pro with 128 GB for Â£800. My name is Peter Pan.\"\n\nInstruction-Based: Users can simply instruct the AI about the information to be filled in, and the AI will handle the rest. For instance, when creating a classified ad for selling a vehicle, providing details like the make, model, and price will prompt the AI to correctly complete the form.\n\nExample: \"Fill in the form with random data for a person from Star Wars\".\n\nPlease note The current beta version of this tool primarily supports only text fields. However, we are actively working on developing improved versions that will accommodate a wider range of input fields, enhancing the tool's versatility and user experience."
