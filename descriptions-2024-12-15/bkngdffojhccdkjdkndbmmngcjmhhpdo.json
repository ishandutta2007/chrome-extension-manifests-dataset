Analyze all the text in the page you are currently viewing.\n2. Find all the physical locations that appears on the text. For example, \"California\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Golden gate bridge\", \"Menlo park\", etc...\n3. It will then highlight all these places in the text.\n4. It will also create a map on a special place in the top part of the screen, with all the locations that it found on the page\n5. The map will be interactive - user can add/remove places from the map\n\nA typical use case - if you are reading a blog about traveling somewhere and you want to see all the places that are mentioned in this page on a map. then Instead of putting them yourself, one by one, the extension will create the map for you.\n\nOr let's say that you are reading a page describing some potential itinerary, and you quickly want to see all the places on a map"
