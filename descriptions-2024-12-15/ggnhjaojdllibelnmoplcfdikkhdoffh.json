This extension helps users simulate the fusion process by calculating the possible stat outcomes of evolving creatures and displaying these results through intuitive radar charts.\n\nKey Features:\n\nStat Customization: Input desired stats for the evolved creature and the stats of the base Illuvials to analyze potential fusion outcomes.\nPreset Configurations: Quickly populate the stats for balanced, offensive, or defensive setups for both base Illuvials and desired creatures.\n\nFusion Simulation: Calculate the most probable, middle case, best case, and worst case scenarios for fusion results.\n\nReroll Functionality: Reroll the most probable and middle-case outcomes to explore other possibilities and fine-tune your strategy.\n\nFusion Feedback: Receive detailed feedback on how close the fused creature's stats match the recommended stats, with an overall performance rating (Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement).\n\nAdvanced Probability Breakdown: Get a detailed probability breakdown for achieving your desired stats based on the inputted Illuvial stats.\n\nMultiple Rerolls: Evaluate different potential outcomes of fusion with multiple reroll options to explore various scenarios.\n\nVisual Output: Beautiful radar charts display the results, making it easy to visualize and compare potential outcomes.\n\nWhy Install?\n\nIf youâ€™re an Illuvium player who wants to maximize your fusion results and ensure you get the best stats possible for your evolved creatures, this tool will save you time and give you a competitive edge. By using intuitive charts and smart simulations, you can make informed decisions about which Illuvials to fuse to create powerful evolved creatures."
