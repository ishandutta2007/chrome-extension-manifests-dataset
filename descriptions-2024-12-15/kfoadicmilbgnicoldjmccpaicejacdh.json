It will then show the closest matching license and provide a redline showing differences against the canonical SPDX license text. This can be useful when trying to identify an open source license or determining if it has been changed.\n\nThe SPDX License List is a list of commonly found licenses and exceptions used in free and open source and other collaborative software or documentation. The purpose of the SPDX License List is to enable easy and efficient identification of such licenses and exceptions in an SPDX document, in source files or elsewhere. The SPDX License List includes a standardized short identifier, full name, vetted license text including matching guidelines markup as appropriate, and a canonical permanent URL for each license and exception.\n\nReleased under GPL-3.0 (for now)\n\nRelease notes:\nhttps://github.com/spdx/spdx-license-diff/releases"
