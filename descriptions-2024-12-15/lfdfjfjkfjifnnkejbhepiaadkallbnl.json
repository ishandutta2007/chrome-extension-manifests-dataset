Hovering over a component or an HTML tag will present a component preview with all classes expanded.\nv0.6.0\n- Added a hotkey Alt+E to enable (opt-in) the hover provider\nv0.5.0\n- Enhanced UX - introducing our notification floaty! This helpful companion will appear if you're not signed in, don't have an active subscription or seat for a private repo, are new around these parts (so we can give you some initial tips), or when unanticipated errors strike\n- Loading indicator to let you know as soon as your project compiles and you're ready-to-go with our hover provider."
