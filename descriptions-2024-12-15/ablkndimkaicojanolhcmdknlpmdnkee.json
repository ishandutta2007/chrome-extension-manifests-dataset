TaleSpire does a great job with so many aspects of the tabletop gaming experience, but character sheets is not one of them. While there are a handful of plugins you can install to handle character sheets, none of them (in my opinion) are on par with a Roll20 character sheet. The biggest downside of using Roll20 to handle your character sheet for a TaleSpire game is being unable to roll from Roll20 directly into TaleSpire .. which is where this application comes in!\n\nHow to Use\n\n1. Roll20 Character Sheet\n\nFrom your character sheet you can make rolls from the Core section of the character sheet. There is also support to recognize the Advantage/Disadvantage toggle, which will load up your TaleSpire dice tray with two rolls.\n\n- Open up your character sheet on Roll20\n- With the character sheet window active, hover your mouse overtop the clickable label for the dice roll you want to perform. The text colour should turn from black to red.\n- Hit shift on your keyboard\n- A Chrome dialog should pop up asking if you want to open \"TaleSpireUrlRelay\". Yes you do, and you can toggle the option to \"Always allow chrome-extension://[..]\" and this dialog won't show up again.\n- Over in TaleSpire, your dice tray should have been populated with the roll you selected in Roll20. Pickup the dice and roll!\n\n2. Chrome Extension Popup\n\nFrom the popup you can quickly send whatever roll you want into TaleSpire, as long as it is of a valid dice type supported by the game. You can toggle Advantage/Disadvantage, and even add a name for your roll that will be displayed in the VTT.\n\n- Click on the extension icon, and it will open a popup\n- The popup allows you to type the target dice roll, toggle advantage/disadvantage, and provide a name for your roll which will be displayed in TaleSpire\n- Enter your roll information, hit submit, and fire away!\n- Note: the popup isn't that large, and it cuts off most of the Chrome dialog asking for permission when opening the TaleSpireUrlRelay. I highly suggest hitting the \"Always allow chrome-extension://[..]\" checkbox before hitting the \"Open TaleSpireUrlRelay\" button so the dialog doesn't show up again."
