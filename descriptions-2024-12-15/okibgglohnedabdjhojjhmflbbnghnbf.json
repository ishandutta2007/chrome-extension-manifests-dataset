Buffer is a service to schedule your posts to your social-media-accounts easily (e.g. to Twitter).\n\nBut there is no way to share your links to buffer (or any other social-media-services) right from the Pocket-Web-User-Interface. Thats exactly what this extension does.\n\nIt grabs the arcticle-title and article-url and sends it to the buffer-API, opens a new tab and shows you the buffer-dialog you are already used to.\n\nThis is really the ultra-first version 0.001. If something doesn't work or you have suggestions let me know.\n\nROADMAP:\n- make an overlay over the article like the original buffer-extension (no new tabs)\n- make compatible to Chrome < v20 (due to \"onMessage\"-events currently)\n- integrate other social-services (facebook, twitter) directly\n- ..."
