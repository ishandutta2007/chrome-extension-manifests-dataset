The clipboard content is stored in chronological order of when it was copied.\n\nIn order to view every piece of clipboard content from the current Chrome session, click on the browser action icon. This will display text boxes containing everything that was copied in this session, allowing you to reselect any text that you previously had in your clipboard."
