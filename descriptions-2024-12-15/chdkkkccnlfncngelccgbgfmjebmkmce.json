The ARC Toolkit is tightly integrated with Chromeâ€™s Developer Tools and uses the ARC rule set, the same rules used by default in the ARC platform. This allows developers and quality assurance testers to take their ARC testing into their development environments and thoroughly investigate issues raised in ARC scans.\n\nLaunched from the Developer Tools, the ARC Toolkit panel includes a set of tests that shows results both in the panel and in the page itself. Each test can be toggled on and off so types of issues can be isolated. Issues can be selected and viewed directly in the Elements panel.\n \nIt runs completely local within Chrome and works within iframes, so it can evaluate any page you can browse to. If you would like to pages that are not live on a website but are in development, turn on the option to \"Allow access to file URLs\".\n \nBecause this tool is actively used by the TPGi team, there are frequent updates as we further develop and refine the rules and features. If you would like training on how to use ARC Toolkit for testing, please contact TPGi at https://www.tpgi.com/contact/.\n\nThis extension is governed by the license agreement at https://www.tpgi.com/arc-toolkit-the-service-terms-of-service/."
