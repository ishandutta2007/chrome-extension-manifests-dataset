Forget about it? Yup!\n- Don’t worry! EZGiftCard will remind you to spend them. Whether you walk into your favorite store or checking out online, EZGiftCard will notify you about your gift cards that can be redeemed.\n- Then simply scan the app generated barcode in-store or select the gift card you want to use from the EZGiftCard browser extension and click apply. Voila! Gift Cards Redeemed!\n\nThis app uses background location to remind our users, when they walk into a merchant's physical store, of gift cards that can be used there."
