Click to look up the word in a dictionary.\n\n- Open-Source: Unlike many browser extensions that do not disclose their code, leaving you uncertain about their operations, this extension allows you to review every line of code. Furthermore, you can build it yourself or contribute to it on GitHub.\n\n- Keyboard shortcut: Use `Alt`(`Option` on macOS) + `Shift` + `P` to toggle annotation (customizable)."
