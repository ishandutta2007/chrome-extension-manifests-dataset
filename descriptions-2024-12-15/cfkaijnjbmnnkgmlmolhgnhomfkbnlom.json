Although some believe he has the power to delete Twitter at will, the truth is he doesn't have a \"Delete Twitter\" button.\n\nBut don't worry, we've got you covered. Introducing our new extension, now available on the Google Web Store! With just a click of a button, you can easily delete Twitter without any hassle.\n\nNo need to thank me, Elon Musk!"
