Empty hours are irrelevant and waste space on your screen. This extension lets you minimize the range of hours in the morning on your Google Calendar, so you only see the title of events during those hours.\n\nHow does it work?\n1. Click “Add to Chrome” to install the extension for free from the official Chrome Web Store.\n2. Reload or open your Google Calendar in Chrome: https://www.google.com/calendar\n3. In the Day/Week/3 or 7 days view, you will notice a new small gray handle at the top of the times on the left. Drag it down to hide morning hours.\nIf you want to show those hours again, simply click the gray hidden hours at the top of the times on the left.\n\nWho is it for?\nWhen you use your calendar for work or school, you can set a range of working hours in the day that fits your schedule and remove the unnecessary white space during the times you're out of office or sleeping.\n\nThis extension currently works if the language of Google Calendar is set to English (US). Support for more languages coming soon.\n\nFeel free to ask us any questions or tell us what you think. Contact at www.raphaelschaad.com.\nThanks for giving us a rating, if you like your clean new calendar look."
