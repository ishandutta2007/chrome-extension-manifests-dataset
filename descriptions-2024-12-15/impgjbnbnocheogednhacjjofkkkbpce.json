If the page tree macro is installed in your Confluence space's side bar, this extension hacks it.\n\nWith Confluence Pagetree Search, you can livesearch the pages by typing a part of the title name. This will solve your large pain when the space grew too large to find the page instantly.\n\nThis extension is confirmed to work on Confluence version 6.13.8. If there is any problem on the plugin, please report an GitHub issue from the web site link. However, because the author is outside Atlassian, I am unable to reproduce the problem and fix them using various Confluence versions. I appreciate that you fix the code and send the Pull Requests on GitHub."
