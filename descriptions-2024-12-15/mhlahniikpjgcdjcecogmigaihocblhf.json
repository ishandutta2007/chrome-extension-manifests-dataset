Just click the 'Save tabs' button, name your session and you are good to go. If you do not specify a name for the session you are trying to save, a timestamp of that moment will be added as the name of the session.\n\nTo restore previously saved tabs, click on the 'Restore' button to restore the full session. You can also restore a single link by expanding the session and clicking on the link you wish to restore.\n\nNo tracking, no data is sent across the internet. Everything is saved locally on your device.\n\nYou can audit the code and participate in the development of the extension on its repository:\nhttps://github.com/guillermoso/tab-saving-extension\n\nPlease report any issues or questions at the issues section of the project:\nhttps://github.com/guillermoso/tab-saving-extension/issues"
