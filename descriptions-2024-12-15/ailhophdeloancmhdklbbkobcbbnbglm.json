You can then easily build automation tests from those recordings, and collaborate with other testers / devs in your team. \n\nTestChimp analyzes recorded payloads to intelligently suggest thorough assertions and chains the requests by defining appropriate variables - making test authoring a breeze. You can edit the test via our intuitive no-code Test Studio with just a few clicks.\n\n2) Share bug reports / sessions easily with TestChimp Permalinks\n\nTired of uploading bulky video files to Jira tickets / reports etc. Going back and forth with devs to communicate more context and troubleshoot? Each session captured by TestChimp gets a unique permalink - ideal for linking in bug reports, and sharing with devs for troubleshooting - without needing for bulky uploads.\n\n3) Simplified Exploratory Testing with TestChimp Context Menu Add-ons\n\nWant to input test credit card numbers? Invalid urls? A large text? TestChimp extension adds convenient access to common edge cases, valid / invalid inputs for quicker exploratory testing. It also adds dynamic value support such as current date,  random values etc. You can select any text and add them as a custom vocabulary item, giving easy access to commonly used domain specific inputs for your systems.\n\n#DevTools #ApiAutomation #BugReporting #RecordReplay #QA #ManualTesting"
