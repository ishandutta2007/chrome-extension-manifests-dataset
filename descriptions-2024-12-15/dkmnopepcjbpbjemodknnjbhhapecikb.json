Find out where you fall short and improve your resume. \n\nThe Upkey browser extension is a super-tool that you can take with you across the web, as you search for your dream job.\n\nUpkey helps you optimize your resume for every job you want to apply to, in order to apply confidently. \n\nDid you know that ~75% of job applicants never hear back from the companies they apply with? Most of the times, it’s the enterprise screening software (ATS - Applicant Tracking Systems) that rejects applicants automatically because they can’t parse resumes correctly, or the resumes don’t match up with the job descriptions. \n\nUpkey gives you x-ray vision into how the typical ATS sees your resume and the insights you need to prepare a stellar resume. \n\nLearn more at https://upkey.com"
