There is instead a simple overlay (which can be minimised or closed) with an autosaving text box for you to note down ideas for tweets. To make things easier there is a character count tool that can be opened to check the length of a tweet before attempting to post.\n\nOut of ideas of what to Tweet? There a couple of handy links at the top of the overlay with guides and suggestions on how and what to tweet, i'll be adding a selection of random but \"valuable\" tweet prompts in future updates to the extension.\n\nFinally there is a quick link to view your lists and when viewing someones profile a search box has been added to the right sidebar to search their tweets.\n\nAny suggestions? Find me on twitter @russellbarnard"
