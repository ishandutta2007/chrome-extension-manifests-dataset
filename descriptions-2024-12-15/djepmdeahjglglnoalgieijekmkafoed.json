And I keep looking at the word counter for Google Docs and just having to do the mental math about how many more words I have to write to be done with it. So I was like you know what screw it, I'm gonna make a Chrome Extension to Яeverse the word counter on Google Docs. So I gave up on that essay and started coding this extension and now here we are! Anyway if you also are very easily distracted by the incapable word counter on Google Docs download this extension!"
