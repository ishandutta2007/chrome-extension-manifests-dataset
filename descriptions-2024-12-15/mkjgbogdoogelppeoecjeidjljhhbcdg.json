Subify is here to relieve this frustration by helping to protect your email address with unique subaddresses for each website you sign up for.\n\nUsing Subify can help keep your inbox organized and prevent unwanted emails from cluttering it up. Instead of searching for and unsubscribing from individual emails, you can simply block all emails sent to a particular subaddress. Plus potentially protecting your email address from being sold to third-party companies or used for marketing purposes. This can save you time and give you peace of mind knowing that your email address is better protected."
