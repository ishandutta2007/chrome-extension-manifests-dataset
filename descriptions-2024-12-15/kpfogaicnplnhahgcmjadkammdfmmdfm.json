When you come across a page containing the text you've defined before, you can annotate the defined text where it appears on the page to remind yourself about the text (i.e. what [that] is).\n\nLearning a new language? Having trouble recognizing new words or symbols?\n\nDictionaries are too inconvenient and interrupt reading practice.\nTranslation services are too convenient and remove the practice completely.\n\nCreate custom mappings with the right level of coverage for you. From translations above every new word you learn to personal mnemonics and hints for how to read new symbols, let your own guides follow you across the web at the click of a button.\n\nUse one of the built-in default mappings and edit it to fit your needs.\n- Hiragana to katakana\n- Katakana to hiragana\n- Hiragana to romaji\n- Romaji to hiragana\n- Hiragana to IPA\n- Katakana to romaji\n- Romaji to katakana\n- Greek alphabet minus English overlap to English names\n- Greek alphabet to English names\n- Greek alphabet to English pronunciation guide\n- ... more to come"
