An easy way to do this is to use a GitHub Gist and point the extension at the \"raw\" version of the Gist file.\n\nThen when you're on an unexplained bank transaction in FreeAgent, you can trigger the extension using the icon in the Omnibox (or a keyboard shortcut) to suggest an explanation for the transaction. The extension tries to find a rule matching the bank transaction description and if it finds one, it'll make the appropriate changes to the explanation form, but you still need to manually check the changes and submit the form.\n\nPlease feel free to report bugs or request features on the project's GitHub issues page[2].\n\nNote: This extension was developed by Go Free Range Ltd which is not affiliated to FreeAgent Central Ltd and we do not mean to imply that they endorse it in any way.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/freerange/freeagent_transaction_explainer#readme\n[2]: https://github.com/freerange/freeagent_transaction_explainer/issues"
