Only to find out that the font that you picked doesn't even look good with your text?\n\nWordmark.it (https://wordmark.it) helps you choose fonts by quickly displaying your text with your fonts, neatly arranged in a visual grid, allowing you to easily compare and pick the best option.\n\nWordmark.it can preview the default system fonts already installed on your computer. Adding this extension to Chrome will enable Wordmark.it to show the fonts you have installed on your computer as well."
