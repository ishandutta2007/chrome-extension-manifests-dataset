Whether you're a student, researcher, professional, or someone that just likes to doodle, WebSketch may be the perfect extension for you!\n\nWith its intuitive interface and set of annotation tools, WebSketch lets you quickly mark up and annotate any webpage you want. Highlight important text, draw attention to key points, or add your own notes using freehand drawing or text boxes. \n\nNeed to share or save your annotations for later? No problem! With WebSketch, you can download the annotated page as a PDF, so you can easily share your thoughts and ideas with others.\n\nTo use WebSketch, add the extension to your device. Then, pin the extension to your taskbar. Click on the extension icon on any webpage to open up the drawing interface. From there, you can select your drawing tool and change the size, color, opacity, etc. When you are done drawing, you can click the \"X\" in the upper righthand corner (or the escape key!) to exit out of the drawing interface - while your drawings remain within the page.\n\nSo if you're looking for a powerful and user-friendly annotation tool for your browser, look no further than WebSketch. Try it today!\n\nThis extension is brand new and is considered to be a work in progress. That means I will be providing frequent updates and am looking for ways to improve on it.
