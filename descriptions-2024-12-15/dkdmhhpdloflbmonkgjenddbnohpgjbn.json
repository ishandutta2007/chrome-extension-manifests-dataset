By clearly displaying the Official Dogs of Elon rarity ranking of each individual NFT you are able to tell exactly where a particular dog is ranked and thus recognize a great deal quicker than anyone else!\n\nThe rarity rank is clearly displayed right on top of the item card on the OpenSea marketplace.  The ranks are color-coded into five categories based on rarity for quick identification purposes. \nThe five categories are:  \nExotic  (rank 1-2000)\nLegendary (rank 2001-4000)\nRare (rank 4001-6000)\nUncommon (rank 6001-8000)\nCommon (rank 8001 -10000)\n\nThese ranking levels are completely customizable within the extension.\n\nFAQ:\n\nIs it free? \n\nTo access this plugin you will need to hold 5000 DOE tokens.  Once you have verified that you hold the required amount of DOE the extension is 100% free.  No initial cost, no monthly cost. FREE\n\nIs it safe?\n\n100% Safe.  This extension was developed in-house entirely by the Core Dogs of Elon team member @S0N_0F_BISCUIT  It contains no malicious code of any kind.  Google has an extremely thorough process to publish extensions on their web store.  All code involved in this extension has been vetted and approved by google to be 100% free from any type of malicious code.\n\nHow do I verify my DOE tokens?\n\nOnce installed and opened for the first time a QR code will appear.  Scan the QR code with your wallet app on your phone (Metamask, Trust wallet etc)  Agree to the connection via your wallet app.  The extension will verify that you own the 5000 DOE tokens required to use this app.  The extension will only be able to view your wallet and its transactions the same way that anyone is able to view your wallet or transactions on etherscan.  It will not have any access to nor will it be able to transfer or move any funds.\n\nWhat if my DOE tokens are staked?\n\nNo worries. As long as you are using the wallet from which you staked your DOE tokens the extension will be able to tell if you are over the 5000 Token holder requirement via your wallets transaction history.  By the way, fantastic choice to stake your tokens! 60%+ APR is no joke!  \n\n\nAny further questions?
