When text is selected, you can right-click that selection and have the option to create a QR code one of 3 things: text, phone number or SMS. \n\nThe \"QR Code text or link\" will create a QR code that you can scan that will simply copy over the selection or the link you just right-clicked on.\n\nThe \"QR Code phone\" will create a QR code that your device can easily parse as a phone number. That way you can easily call the selected phone number. \n\nThe \"QR Code SMS\" will create a QR code that your device can parse as text for a new SMS. When scanning this QR code, you'll still have to provide a phone number to which the SMS needs to be sent to. The content however will be pre-filled by your selection.\n\nTo close the QR code in your browser, simply click anywhere on the screen."
