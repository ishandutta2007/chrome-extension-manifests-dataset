It is designed to empower its users with state-of-the-art security, unparalleled flexibility, and innovative monetization opportunities built over a unique P2P advertisement layer. Discover the WalletX difference and how weâ€™re redefining the interaction between users, decentralized applications (dApps), and the broader web3 ecosystem.\n\nProblem Statement:\nIn the current landscape of on-chain and Web3 wallet usage, users are not incentivized for engaging in on-chain activities or utilizing Web3 wallets such as Metamask. Likewise, web3 advertisers struggle to connect with on-chain users and execute targeted advertisements in a Web3 manner.\n\nSolution:\nWalletX offers a unique solution by providing sponsored gas transactions for users during their transactions. In exchange for sponsored gas, users will view advertisements from sponsors and earn EXP points. These EXP points are convertible to USDT or WAX tokens, offering users tangible rewards for their engagement. The cornerstone of this solution lies in WalletX's pioneering Peer-to-Peer (P2P) advertisement layer, marking the world's first implementation of such technology in the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nCutting-edge Features:\nGasless Transactions: Execute transactions across major EVM networks without paying gas fees.\nNon-Custodial Security: Retain complete control over digital assets with WalletX's non-custodial security model.\nSeamless dApp Connectivity: Explore the decentralized web effortlessly with WalletX's seamless dApp integration.\nMultichain Support: Manage assets across multiple blockchain networks seamlessly.\nMulti-Wallet Support: Manage multiple wallets within the same WalletX extension with unique seed phrases.\nUser Dashboard: Access a comprehensive dashboard to track activity, earn EXP rewards, and engage with advertisers who sponsored them.\nEXP Conversion: Get incentivised for doing activities as an early user and earn EXPs. Convert your EXP points to USDT or hold for future conversion into WAX tokens in October 2024."
