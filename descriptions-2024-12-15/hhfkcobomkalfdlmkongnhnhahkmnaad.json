Instead of typing use voice input to quickly and easily search for the things you care about. \n\nDictate your essays on Google Docs in record time and comment on social media with ease -- using just your voice! \n\nSearch by speaking: just click on the microphone and say \"kittens\" to search for kittens. If you specifically want pictures of kittens, say \"google images kittens\". Want to learn more about World War II? Say \"wikipedia world war two\".\n\nVoice Search comes pre-loaded with the following default services: Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Wolfram|Alpha. You can also add your own user-defined search engines.\n\nPlease remember: this extension requires a microphone!\n\nFeatures:\n - Voice input to Google, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, Google Maps, YouTube just to name a few!\n - Dictation for writing essays and comments on many websites\n - Speech recognition and voice commands let you quickly search with just one click.",
    "es,ru": "Voice Search provides a method to search by speaking. For example, just click on the microphone and say \"kittens\" to search for kittens. If you specifically want pictures of kittens, say \"google images kittens\". Want to learn more about World War II? Say \"wikipedia world war two\".\n\nVoice Search comes pre-loaded with the following default services: Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Wolfram|Alpha. You can also add your own user-defined search engines. It also integrates speech input buttons for text fields on all websites.\n\nThis extension requires a microphone. Speech input is very experimental, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work. Also, try to speak clearly for best speech recognition results.\n\nYou may need to launch Chrome with the --enable-speech-input flag. To do this on Windows, right click on your Google Chrome icon (shift+right click while Chrome is closed for Windows 7 if you have it pinned to the task bar), and set the target field to the following value:\n\n    %LocalAppData%\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe --enable-speech-input\n\nIn OSX, it's a little more complicated. You have to create an Apple Script with the following code and save it in ~/Applications/\n\n    do shell script \"/Applications/Google\\\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\\\ Chrome --enable-speech-input\"\n\nFeature suggestions or bug reports? Go to http://purl.eligrey.com/github/voice-search/issues to file them. Please note that keyboard shortcut support or automatically capturing speech input as soon as the extension button is clicked are not possible at this time.\n\nI do not have a CR-48 and cannot promise that this works on Chrome OS without one. Contact me (http://purl.eligrey.com/contact) if you'd be willing to send me your CR-48 to help."
