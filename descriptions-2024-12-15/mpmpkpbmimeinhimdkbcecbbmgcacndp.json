Ideal for those who need to unfollow multiple profiles.\n\nWith this tool, it is possible to unfollow 144 profiles per day. Unfortunately, Instagram has limits, and these limits vary from account to account. For this reason, we limit the processing time and the number of unfollows. We recommend using the extension sparingly to ensure its continuous functionality.\n\nüß∞ Features\n- Mass unfollow users who don't follow you back\n- Mass unfollow users who you are following\n- Auto unfollow process in the background\n- Exclude Users that should not be unfollowed\n- No proxy required\n\nüìÉ How to Start Unfollowing?\n- Choose the type of unfollowing\n- Click the Start Unfollowing button\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Attention\nThe tool automatically unfollows 144 users per day (6 users per hour). There is a delay of 10 minutes between each unfollow to keep your account safe from Instagram‚Äôs detection. Even so, we also provide the setting option of adjusting the time interval for the request of unfollow.\n\nüì¨ Contact\nIf you have any questions or suggestions to improve the extension, please feel free to contact us at jfl913@gmail.com.\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è Statement\nIG Auto Unfollow is an independent third-party Chrome extension and has no affiliation with Instagram, Meta Platforms, Inc., or their affiliated companies.
