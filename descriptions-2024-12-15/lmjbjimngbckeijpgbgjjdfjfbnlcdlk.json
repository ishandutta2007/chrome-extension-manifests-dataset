Chord charts are usually only displayed via mouseover, which prevents you from seeing all chords while playing.\n\nThe extension is imperfect due to limitations of operating on top of the website's elements. The website sometimes reloads elements unexpectedly. I've tried to account for this, but there may  occasionally be issues (refresh always fixes them for me).\n\nNote: when the chord names are too close together to accommodate the chord charts, the spacing is adjusted. Chord charts may end up shifted away from the word/syllable they were originally over.\n\nDespite these quirks, it's super useful to me and I use it all the time :) I hope it will be useful to others as well!"
