Over 100 favicons are included, with more on the way!\n\nAnd it doesn't read your browsing history (like some other favicon extensions).\n\nA note:  This specific version of my extension will only work on AWS in China (amazonaws.cn).  And because I can't create an account there, there's no way for me to test this but it's an exact copy of https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aws-favicon-update/ohloajnmmkniehhbmjakbejnomonmijc so hopefully it will work well.\n\nIf this little extension has made your life easier, the tip jar can be found here: https://www.paypal.me/JB4GDI/"
