And if a sales rep can’t be there in real-time, Driftbot will jump into the conversation and automatically schedule a meeting with the prospect for later.\n\nIn addition, sales reps will be able to track opens and clicks, see conversation history, and get real-time alerts when a prospect responds to a conversation, as well as enroll leads in email sequences directly from within Salesforce.\n\nThe Drift extension also includes performance reporting for sales managers, so they can see how many conversations reps are having, their conversion rates, and more."
