When you visit a blocked website, you'll see our calming green screen and be directed back towards your work.  \n\nOn Mac and Windows devices, the Freedom extension is designed to be paired with our desktop apps and does not have stand-alone functionality.  On ChromeOS (ChromeBooks) and Linux devices, Freedom connects directly to our service and enables you to block websites or the entire internet.  The Freedom Chrome extension works with both our trial (free) and premium (paid) accounts.\n\nWe offer a range of extensions to help you improve your digital habits, including Pause, Insight, and Limit.  \n\nThousands of people rely on Freedom every day to write, study, cook, design, build, play, think, learn, and find the focus to do the things that truly matter.  We're honored to help you.\n\nFor more information â†’ https://support.freedom.to/getting-started/set-up-installation/browser-extension"
