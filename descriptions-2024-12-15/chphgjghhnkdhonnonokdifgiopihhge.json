This also maintains the use of the https://apod.nasa.gov website so all page views still count toward them.  \n\nRight now this extension only restyles a couple of page layouts.  More are being worked on and new features such as a calendar picker are on the way. While most videos are viewable, some are acting a bit wonky; these are also being worked on."
