So, I decided to create this extension to allow users to easily identify the games already in the family library, helping them make informed decisions about their next purchases and to prioritize other purchases. You won't have to manually check each game in your family's library.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nList of Features:\n路 Automatic display of games in the family library: Easily identify which games are already available to avoid duplicate purchases.\n路 Identifies games in the store:  Easily identify which games are already available in the family, by who and how many of them.\n路 Visual indicator: Shows a bookmark icon next to the games already shared in the wishlist.\n路 Internationalization: Available in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Chinese.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhere does the extension work?\nSteamventory works in any user's wishlist sections and the steam store.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteamventory is a free, ad-free, and open-source extension.\nDiscover all the code behind Steamventory in the public GitHub repository.\n\nhttps://github.com/Wito982/Steamventory\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you wish to support the project and help continue improving Steamventory, you can contribute through Ko-fi. It will be greatly appreciated!\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/wito982"
