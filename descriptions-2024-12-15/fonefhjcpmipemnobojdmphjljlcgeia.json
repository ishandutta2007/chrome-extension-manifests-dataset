Well if so, then Appetized is for you.\n\nAppetized allows users to store and organize their favorite recipes from around the web, all on a single platform.   Once you've logged in, you can browse all the recipes that have ever been added to Appetized, or add your own favorite recipes from any of our supported sites (listed below).  Furthermore, Appetized gives you your own personal recipe box where you can store recipes, create folders, and make grocery lists that can be emailed to you.\n\nUsing the Appetized Chrome Extension, adding a recipe to your recipe box is even easier.  Instead of copying and pasting the recipes link, simply open the chrome extension, click save, and that's it!  The next time you go to your recipe box, your dded recipe will be there.\n\n\nOur supported websites currently* include:\n\n- Food Network\n- Bon Appetit\n- All Recipes\n- Chow Hound\n- Simply Recipes\n- Epicurious\n- New York Times Cooking App\n- Sally's Baking Addiction\n\n* Please note that we are constantly adding sites to this list.
