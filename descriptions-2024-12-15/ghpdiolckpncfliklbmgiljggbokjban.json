This is done in 1 of 2 ways:\n\nPLEASE NOTE: After initially installing Link With Context, it will not work on any currently open tabs until they are refreshed.\n\nCopying a link outright: Using Link With Context when you copy a link, what is actually copied is text in the form ' \"text of link\" - <link> '.  Ultra useful for sharing reddit links that only make sense if the title is included as well! (and the inspiration for this extensions).\n\nHighlighting text: Using Links With Context on highlighted text, what is actually coped is text in the form ' \"highlighted text\" - <url of current website> '.  This will work with any text - you could highlight the whole page and still get a working Link With Context.\n\nThere is however a limit to how much text can be copied at a time, and therefore only the first 7500 characters of the highlighted/link text will be included."
