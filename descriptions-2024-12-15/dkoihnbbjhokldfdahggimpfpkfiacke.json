Rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. \n\nIt must then follow that respect for the name increases respect for the thing itself.\n\nAre you tired of seeing his name everywhere? Want to give him a new clownish moniker for every instance of his name on the internet? This extension does just that. PLEASE NOTE that this extension may generate inappropriate names that should probably not be read by small children. \n\nThis extension will replace:\n - Trump\n - Donald Trump\n - DonaldTrump\n - Donald J. Trump\n\nDon't worry, you can still enjoy Donald Duck related web content with no interference.\n\nVersion 1.11\n------------\n - Fixed a bug in detecting when the content in a page has changed\n - Added several new words to the dictionary\n\nSome code was used from Tom Maxwell's project here: \nhttps://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions/"
