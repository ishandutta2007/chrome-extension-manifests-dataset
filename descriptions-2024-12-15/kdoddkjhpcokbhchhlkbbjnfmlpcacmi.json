This scaling works well for general browsing, as most images on the web are high resolution, but is detrimental to pixel art and low resolution images. Activating PixelSharp changes the page scaling to \"nearest neighbour\", the intended scaling method for pixel art.\n\n\nHow to use:\nThe extension was designed to be pinned so that you can simply click the icon to activate it. You can also activate PixelSharp by first pressing the \"Extensions\" button next to the URL bar and then clicking on PixelSharp in the list of installed extensions.\n\nYou will need to enable \"Allow access to file URLs\" for the extension to work on images loaded from your computer.\n\n\nTechnical details:\nThe extension only activates when clicked. Clicking the extension icon will trigger a single update to the current page which modifies the display styles to use nearest neighbour scaling. After the page has been updated the extension stops. Reloading the page will clear the page modification, essentially reverting the images on the page back to the original browser scaling behaviour.\n\n\nImage attribution:\nThe \"before and after\" image was created from real screen captures of the same image at 500% browser zoom scale, before and after using the PixelSharp extension. The pixel art used to demonstrate this (\"Ninja Adventure - Asset Pack\" by pixel-boy and AAA) was licensed under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license (\"public domain\")."
