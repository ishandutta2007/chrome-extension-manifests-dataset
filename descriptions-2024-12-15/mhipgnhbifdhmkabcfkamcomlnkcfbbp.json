It takes a refreshingly simple approach that makes it really fast to write, run and maintain tests.\n\nYou can install it here as a Chrome Web App or you can visit the home page (https://ontestpad.com) and use it like a normal web app.\n\n\nPERFECT FOR AGILE DEVELOPMENT\n\nTestpad is for:\n- engineers who want a pragmatic solution to product testing;\n- testers in startups who know they can do better than spreadsheets;\n- professional testers shackled by managing test cases one form at a time.\n\n\nFREE STARTER PLAN\n\nTo try Testpad, launch the app and sign-up for an account on the free starter plan. The starter plan is fully functional except that it's limited to 1 user and 5 test scripts.\n\nTestpad has simple import and export features that make it really quick to give it a try with real data. E.g. You can use the Import Dialog to copy and paste a test script straight from a spreadsheet.\n\nAs and when you need more than 1 user or 5 scripts, you can choose from one of the paid plans. Get in touch with support@ontestpad.com if you would like to discuss your trial requirements.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Checklist style case-editing\n\nTest cases are one-line prompts of what to test, organised in an outline editor. It's easy to write, re-write, chop and change; perfect for keeping up with agile product development\n\n- Feels like a native app\n\nIntuitive keyboard control and auto-save as you go means you spend less time reaching for the mouse and more time improving coverage. Write hundreds of tests in minutes.\n\n- Invite 'guest' testers by email\n\nOrganise who tests what, when. Delegate testing to co-workers, or invite guest testers by email. Great for ad-hoc out-sourcing.\n\n- Mobile and Tablet Friendly\n\nFree up your big screen! Run tests on your nearest iPad, iPhone or smart phone. Why switch between windows when there's a spare input device on your desk?\n\n- Library of example test scripts\n\nLook for inspiration in our growing library of examples. Import and use as templates of your own.\n\n- Build your own templates\n\nSave common patterns as templates of your own and have more confidence that your new products have got all the bases covered.\n\n- Rich reporting\n\nTrack the latest progress with live links to interactive reports. Print a snapshot and leave it on your boss's desk or email to clients.\n\n- Simple tagging and filtering\n\nAssign tags to groups of tests and selectively include or exclude them from test runs.\n\n- Easy in\n\nCopy and paste direct from Excel, Word or any plain-text file. Testpad makes it easy to edit and re-structure imported tests.\n\n- Easy out\n\nSimple export of scripts and results as CSV means it's easy to get your data out of Testpad for analysis in other tools.\n\n- Secure hosting\n\nTestpad is hosted on the Amazon Web Services cloud platform, with load-balancing to servers in distributed availability zones. Testpad's databases are replicated three-ways with backups made every hour. Backups are archived on Amazon's S3 long-term storage service. All browser communication with Testpad, including asynchronous javascript calls, is over SSL-encrypted HTTPS connections."
