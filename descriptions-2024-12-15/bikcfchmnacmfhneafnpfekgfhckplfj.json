Simply select a portion of text (at least 50 words) and the extension will determine and display the probability of whether the selected text was generated by GPT-2 or not.\n\nSome notes:\n\n    - The detector itself does not run in your browser. The extension makes HTTP requests to https://huggingface.co/openai-detector where the detector is publicly hosted and processes the response, displaying the results in your browser.\n    - Results should be taken with a grain of salt. The detector is designed specifically to work with GPT-2 generated text. Using a different model or finetuning GPT-2 could be enough to avoid detection. In general, the detector is imperfect. Human-generated text may be marked as GPT-2 generated, and vice-versa."
