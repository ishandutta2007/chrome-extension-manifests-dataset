Trump is gone!\n\n--------------------------\n\n--------------------------\nUpdates versions 1.2.2:\nAdd qoutes from tronalddump.io\nAdd share buttons\nclean up UI\nfix bug that logged the replaced word to the console\n\nadd link to the source,\ndefault value is now very stable genius :)\n\nArtwork by https://www.flickr.com/photos/donkeyhotey/"
