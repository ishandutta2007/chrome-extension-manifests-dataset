But controlling that is hard.\n\n\n📰 THE DAILY DELIVERY\nThe Daily Delivery uses page redirects to version of Gmail, Hacker News, and the NY Times that only update once a day.\n\n\n🛑✋ LIMIT THE PUSH, NOT THE PULL\nIt's not about placing limits on what you can check, or when, or how often. I've tried those. I always uninstalled them out of frustration and slid back into my old habits.\n\nBecause the underlying problem is still there.\n\nThe internet is a never ending stream of novelty. It's the literal definition of a variable reward. Psychologist B.F. Skinner discovered it would drive lab rats wild in his Operant Conditioning Chambers.\n\n\n🧠 YOUR BRAIN WILL RELEARN.\nThe Daily Delivery puts the brakes on the variable reward. By updating once a day, your brain quickly learns not to check so compulsively.\n\n\n⭐WE'RE JUST STARTING\nThis is a beta! It's fast, scrappy, and get's the job done.
