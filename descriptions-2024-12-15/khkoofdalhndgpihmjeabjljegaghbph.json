Is your worldview being poisoned by bizarre claims and unnecessary personal attacks?\n\nDeath to Comments is a chrome extension that blocks comments everywhere. Works on youtube and gakwer sites. Future features may include whitelisting.\n\nThis is beta software that I made in the past hour, there may be bugs and performance issues. Please email me at tom.chambers@gmail.com with bugs and feature requests. I will try to be responsive.\n\nSource code for the comment blocker is available at: https://github.com/tomchambers2/death_to_comments. You are welcome to contribute."
