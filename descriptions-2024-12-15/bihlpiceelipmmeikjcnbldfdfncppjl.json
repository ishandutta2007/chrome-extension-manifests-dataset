(your eyes!).\n\nWhen clicking on the \"Become Dark\" button a couple of CSS classes will be added on top of the current page to invert the color of the elements, so what is white will turn black and what is black will change to white, and so on, since these CSS classes do not belong to the website codebase, the dark effect will be gone when refreshing the page, unless the \"Always be Dark\" option is selected, in that case the classes are added automatically without the need of pressing again the \"Become Dark\" button.\n\nJoin me, I am Darks... and you can be as well!"
