It uses WebSocket to initiate communication between different members and then disconnects from this signaling server. All streams are sent over peer-to-peer WebRTC channels. Meeting creates a distributed network that any peer is responsible to provide streams to the other peers. It uses SHA-256 encryption over the WebSocket signaling channel to protect user privacy. Also, it adjusts video qualities that are streamed to the members to optimize bandwidth. Meeting does not have a limit on the number of attendees as fas as the network can handle streams to all peers. You can even have your own signaling server if you want to increase the privacy or use Meeting on a protected or a local network."
