Print jobs can be released using the PriApps touchscreen app on the printer or MFP, using your ID card or door access badge, or by using the PriApps Touch-Free app for smartphones and tablets.\n\nThis helps organizations increase the security of its confidential documents by ensuring unattended print jobs are not left lying around in the output trays of printers and MFPs.  Customers also testify to a 20% reduction in waste as documents are only printed when the user releases them at the device they choose.\n\nPriApps tracks all print usage, as well as copy, scan & fax usage on copiers and MFPs for reporting, charge-back, cost recovery or analysis.\n\nPriApps also helps organizations reduce the cost of printing & copying by providing a powerful range of features that help manage or enforce print policies.  \n\nThese include:\n- Rules-based printing\n- Copy Control\n- Quota Management\n- Least-cost routing\n- Cost Recovery\n\nIn addition to print management, PriApps provides intuitive document capture through Personalized Scan Workflows.  When authenticating at MFPs & copiers, users are presented with their own, pre-populated, scan workflows with immediate access to corporate address books, eliminating the need to configure every MFP or copier individually.  \n\nThese include:\n\n- Scan-to-myEmail\n- Scan-to-Email\n- Scan-to-homefolder\n- Scan-to-network folder\n- Scan-to-Google Drive\n\nâ€¦as well as a range of other cloud-based document storage systems.\n\nPriApps supports ANY make and model or printer and MFP, and is available as an on-premise, hybrid, or Cloud-based solution."
