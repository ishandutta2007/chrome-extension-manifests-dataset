With just one click, this extension will automatically redirect you to the edit page of the current WordPress post you are viewing. No more manually searching for the post in the admin panelâ€”save time and streamline your workflow!\n\n**Features:**\n- **Automatic Redirection**: Click the extension icon, and it will take you directly to the WordPress post edit page.\n- **Dynamic Base URL Detection**: The extension dynamically identifies the WordPress installation path, even if it's in a subdirectory.\n- **Simple and Intuitive**: No configuration needed. Just install and start using.\n\n**How It Works:**\n1. The extension identifies the WordPress shortlink on the current page.\n2. It dynamically constructs the admin URL based on the detected WordPress installation path.\n3. A new tab opens, taking you directly to the post edit page in the WordPress admin panel.\n\nThis extension is perfect for WordPress administrators, bloggers, and content editors who need quick access to edit their posts.\n\n**Single Purpose Description:**\nThe sole purpose of this extension is to provide a quick and automatic redirection to the WordPress post edit page from the front end of a WordPress site.\n\n**Permissions Justification:**\n- **Active Tab**: Required to access the current tab and retrieve the WordPress post ID from the page.\n- **Scripting**: Required to execute the script that identifies the WordPress shortlink and constructs the admin URL for redirection.\n\n**Privacy Practices:**\n- **Active Tab**: The extension only accesses the current tab to identify the WordPress post ID and construct the redirection URL. No data is stored or transmitted.\n- **Scripting**: The script is executed locally on the user's browser to ensure secure and private redirection to the WordPress admin page.\n\n**Contact Information:**\nFor any questions or support, please contact us at nileshchavan0608@gmail.com.\n\n**Compliance Certification:**\nWe certify that our data usage complies with the Developer Program Policies. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for Privacy Practices Tab:\n\n**Active Tab Justification:**\nThe `activeTab` permission is required to allow the extension to access the current tab's URL and content. This is necessary to extract the WordPress post ID from the shortlink on the page and dynamically construct the URL for the WordPress admin post edit page. The extension does not store or transmit any data accessed from the active tab.\n\n**Remote Code Use Justification:**\nThe extension does not use any remote code. All code is executed locally within the user's browser to ensure privacy and security.\n\n**Scripting Justification:**\nThe `scripting` permission is necessary for the extension to execute the script that identifies the WordPress shortlink and constructs the URL for redirection. This script runs locally on the user's browser and does not collect or transmit any data."
