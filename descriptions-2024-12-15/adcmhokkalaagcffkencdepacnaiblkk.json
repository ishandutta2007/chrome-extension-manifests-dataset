Encryption available.\nSite Settings - Easily modify site settings without changing windows. You can turn off JavaScript or cookies for a site and more. \nRequests - Similar to the network function of the browser's inspect section but not so busy and allows conversion of a request to a python script.  \n\nOptions (Tab view) Tools: \nHTML Sandbox - You can type in HTML/CSS and it will preview live\nRegex Tester - You can type regex and set items to pass or fail. \nRegex Find and Replace - Allows you to find regex patterns and replace them with specific text. \nReferences - some common references you can access offline and edit as needed if you connect your Google account. \nScript - a JavaScript page allowing the user to specify functions to run on certain pages or every page they visit (developer mode must be turned on to see this)"
