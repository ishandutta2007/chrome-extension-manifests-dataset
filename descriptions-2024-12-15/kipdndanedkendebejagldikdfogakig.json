If you're looking at a blame of the file after it's been renamed, you won't be able to jump straight to the blame of the file before it was renamed. You will instead have to follow the commit link for that change, and then on the commit page (which will show the original file), navigate to a blame on _that_ file.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me at carss.w@gmail.com.\n\nAlso, if this somehow breaks something for you, you're the only one responsible for it."
