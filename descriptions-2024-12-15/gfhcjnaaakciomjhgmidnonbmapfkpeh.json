The prevailing options include the ethnonyms \"Hispanic\", \"Latino\", and \"Latinx\". Though the terms are commonly used interchangeably, their definitions are different.\n\n\"Hispanic\" is a term that includes only people from Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America and from Spain. It does not include people from Portugal or Brazil.\n\n\"Latino\" is a shortening of *latinoamericano*, or \"Latin American\" in Spanish. It includes people only from Latin-American countries and not from Spain or Portugal.\n\n\"Latinx\" is the gender-neutral version of \"Latino\".\n\nKnown limitations of this extension:\n- Conversions to \"Latino\" do not include gendered conversions to \"Latina\"."
