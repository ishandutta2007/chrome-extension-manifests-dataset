The blocker needs to do one thing and do it well: blocking unwanted pages.\n\n- lightweight: the extension needs to be extremely fast: we don't want to wait for it during visiting pages.\n\n- private: the extension doesn't collect any data.\n\n- secure: there should be no security holes and security issues with the application.\n\nTo ensure these quadruple attributes we don't use any third-party library and in every aspect, we had in mind the simplicity and efficacy. In that way, we can ensure that the extension doesn't have security holes or doesn't collect any private data.\n\nThe whole extension is open source, under MIT license, at: https://github.com/SiGe11/Lightweight-Blocker-Extension\n\n---\n\nHow to use?\n\nOne can set up pages to block from the Options menu. (Right-click on the extension's icon.)\nYou can list the pages to be blocked in the text area. These can be separated with any kind of separator (space, comma, semicolon, etc). The blocker distinguishes between subdomains. You must specify all subdomains, even 'www'.\n\nBy default, the blocker is inactive. You can activate it by left-clicking on the icon of the extension and clicking on the extension's current status.\n\n---\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy do I see the loaded page for some seconds before it is blocked?\n\nTo ensure the speed the extension checks the pages for blocking asynchronously. This way it has a quasi-zero impact on pages where that should be blocked.\n---\n\nChangelog\n\nhttps://github.com/SiGe11/Lightweight-Blocker-Extension/releases"
