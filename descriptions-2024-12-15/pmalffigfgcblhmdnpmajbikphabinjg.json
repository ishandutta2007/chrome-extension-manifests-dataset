Instead, you are forced to click \"Next\" repeatedly until you reach your desired question. This can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially for long tests.\n\nWith the \"NBME Next Clicker,\" you can automate this process effortlessly:\n\nEnter the Target Question: Simply input the section number and item number of the question you want to navigate to.\nStart the Automation: Click the \"Start\" button, and the extension will automatically click \"Next\" for you, stopping when it reaches the specified question.\nStop Anytime: Need to halt the process? Click the \"Stop\" button to pause the automation at any time.\n\nFeatures:\n\n-Automates the process of navigating to a specific question in large tests.\n-Logs the current section and item number in the console for easy tracking.\n-Simple and intuitive interface to set your target section and item number.\n-Save time and reduce frustration with automated clicking."
