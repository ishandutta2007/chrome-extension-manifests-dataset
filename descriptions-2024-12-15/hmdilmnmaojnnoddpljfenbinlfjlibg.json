Translations include multiple exceptions and phonetic transcription.\n\n* Memorize: Memslate keeps track of your translations. You can order, filter and review them whenever you want in order to memorize them.\n\n* Play: And finally Memslate can perform tests, based on your previous translations. The tests are performed in order to help you memorize them. Learn while playing!\n\nIf you register a free Memslate account you can share your translations across multiple devices, review and play with them. Otherwise you will be translating anonymously. Anonymous translations are deleted every day.\n\nPowered by LibreTranslate."
