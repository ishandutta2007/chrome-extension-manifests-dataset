We'll only ask you to fill out things that are high value.\n\nFREE TO USE\nOur Starter plan comes with 4 free seats.\n\nFOR TEAMS\nIf you need a larger plan you can contact us at admin@eventlibrary.io\n\nINTEGRATIONS\nEventLibrary integrates directly with Segment so you can easily upload your event taxonomy. We also supports CSV uploads if you want to export from a product like Amplitude or Mixpanel or upload an excel spreadsheet you've been tracking your taxonomy in."
