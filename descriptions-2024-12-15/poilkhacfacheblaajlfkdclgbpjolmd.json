You might lose sense of where you are - in a bulleted list? A new paragraph?\n\nSplashReader lets you easily toggle back and forth between speed-reading and normal reading with a flick of a space bar. It pauses every paragraph, giving a sense of context. Highlight a word to re-read a section or start again somewhere new.\n\nDon't sacrifice comprehension for speed when you don't have to. \n\nSplashReader is an RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation), similar to other excellent speed-readers like Reedy, Spreed, Spritz, Squirt.io, and Glance. The primary differentiator is the ease with which you can move back and forth between one-word-at-a-time speed reading, and standard reading. \n\nSplashReader is open-source, with the code available at http://github.com/rattrayalex/splashreader"
