Or use a paid service for a few months, stopped using it and kept getting charged?\n\nSubscrybe is here to solve that problem, while minimizing friction.\n\nIt works in your browser, so everytime you are on a subscription page, the extension pops up and lets you save that subscription in just 1 click.\n\nThen once your subscription is nearing its billing date, we send you a text letting you know. So you never have to remember all the subscriptions you are subscribed to, their expiry dates etc."
