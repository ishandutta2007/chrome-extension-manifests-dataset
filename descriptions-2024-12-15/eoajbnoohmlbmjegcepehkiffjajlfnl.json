The extension does not evaluate or store previous history, cookies, or other browser data.\n\nWe encourage you to close all open tabs before installing the extension and starting the interview.\n\nYour privacy and comfort while taking the interview are important. This extension uses the Chrome API that allows extensions to access tabs, including URLs and titles. When installing the Filtered Extension in Chrome, you will receive a security alert that says the extension can \"read your browser history.\" This lets you know that as you open and close tabs, the extension can access information about the sites you are visiting. This permission does not grant access to your entire browser history - only tabs open when you launch your interview and those you access during the interview. More information can be found in the Chrome Extension Developer documents here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/"
