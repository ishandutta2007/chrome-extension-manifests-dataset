I am working to update it, but the time to completion is unknown as I have a large number of other commitments.\n\nProvides styling and functionality enhancements for OpenAir timesheet functionality.  Focused on the \"Grid\"/Edit screen - this extension adds:\n* Chosen (improved selects) for selecting project and task\n* Inline timers for each entry\n* Inline notes functionality\n\nAnd adds Bootstrap and theming to make the experience more enjoyable and easier to use.\n\nChangelog:\n0.4 - Added Autosave and Improved notes functionality.  Fixed various minor issues.\n0.5 - Fixed issue with chosen selects being inline\n0.6 - Added options page with slimline option\n0.7 - Makes some table styling more specific to the timesheet page to avoid conflicts with other  \n         screens\n0.7.1 - Minor theming cleanup\n0.8 - Added a single line version (currently does not include timers)\n0.9 - Highlight today.  Improved theming on inactive days.  Made storage per timesheet id.\n0.9.1 - Fixed issue with timers disappearing on multimonth spreadsheets\n0.10 - Added Calendar overview table which sums the hours for the time period by project and task.  Fixed issues with timesheet page tables being too wide, themed the submission workflow more.\n0.11 - Fixed a small issue with parsing some calendar entries, added some better report theming.\n0.12 - Removed chosen for the time being as Open Air has done something which conflicts with chosen and breaks loading of project tasks"
