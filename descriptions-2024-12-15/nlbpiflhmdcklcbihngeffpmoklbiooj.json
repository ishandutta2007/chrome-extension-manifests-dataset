    "tr": "Decreased Productivity (DP) creates a more \"consistent\" browsing experience (for you and others around you) by letting you control what you want to see (\"stealth browsing\" => text/page background colours, the cloaking of images, hiding page favicons, changing fonts, etc.). You can choose what style you want (e.g. green text on a black background) by going to the Options page (right-click on icon in address bar and click on \"Options\"). DP has tab-specific support and domain whitelisting/blacklisting!\n\nSupports Arabic, German, English (US and British), Spanish, Tagalog, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazilian and Portugal), Russian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional)!\n\nPlease note that I am not responsible for what you do with this extension and any subsequent consequences; please browse responsibly.\n\nFeatured on Lifehacker: http://lifehacker.com/5666312/decreased-productivity-for-chrome-camouflages-your-non+work-browsing\n\nFeature List:\n-change the default font and font size for cloaked pages (Calibri, Helvetica, Arial, or leave page fonts unchanged)\n-set page background, text, link, and table border colours\n-hide page icons (aka favicons)\n-replace page titles\n-keyboard toggle (CTRL + 12)\n-choose between tab-specific cloaking or global cloaking\n-choose whether new tabs are cloaked or uncloaked by default\n-control image opacity\n-whitelist/blacklist domains (whitelisted domains will never be cloaked while blacklisted domains will always be cloaked (even if \"Enable\" is unticked))\n-add right-click option to open links/images safely (can be removed in Options)\n-choose between four modes: Paranoid (remove images and multimedia), SFW0 (cloak images and multimedia), SFW1 (cloak images and remove multimedia), SFW2 (cloak images only), and NSFW (show all)\n-add toggle icon in address bar (can be removed in Options)\n-choose from 98 different icons for added discreetness\n-set a custom title for the address bar icon\n-choose to always show images that are within a specified dimension\n-quickly whitelist/blacklist the current tab's domain by right-clicking on the toolbar icon\n-import/export settings\n-add custom css code\n\n#################################################\n\nChangelog:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nv0.46.56.11 - Friday, October 12, 2018\n- Fix WhatsApp Web blank white screen upon login\n- Add Turkish translation - thanks Serdar!\n- Improve Portuguese (Brazil) translation - thanks Cleber!\n- Improve Japanese translation - thanks cignoir!\n\nv0.46.56.10 - Monday, December 4, 2017\n- Improve WhatsApp Web compatibility: fix blank white screen upon login\n- Firefox\n\nv0.46.56.9 - Monday, April 17, 2017\n- Tweaked Paranoid Mode - increased usability (e.g. Disqus comment threads now readable) - iframes now visible; cloaked at conservative opacity levels: 5% unhovered / 50% on hover\n- Improve Facebook compatibility: main timeline titles, overlayed photos, and chat emojis\n- Improve WhatsApp Web compatibility: emojis and message indicators\n- Improve Twitter compatibility: overlayed photos\n- Improve YouTube compatibility: remove top and bottom bars to increase cloaked video visibility\n- Add Wikia compatibility: hide background images\n\nv0.46.56.7 - Monday, July 25, 2016\n- Added capability to Import/Export Settings (and even save your settings to a text file)\n- Added option to add custom CSS\n- Added support for cloaking of <canvas> elements\n\nv0.46.56.6 - Tuesday, June 21, 2016\n- minor fixes and improved YouTube cloaking\n\nv0.46.56.5 - Monday, June 20, 2016\n- Added support for IPv6 addresses\n- Improved performance for users with large lists\n\nv0.46.56.4 - Sunday, June 5, 2016\n- Proudly presenting a long-awaited feature: wildcards and single character matching support:\n--- Domain Matching: domain.com matches domain.com and www.domain.com\n--- Wildcard Matching: *.domain.com matches anything.domain.com (but not domain.com (no subdomain))\n--- Single Character Matching: ?.abc.com matches a.abc.com, b.abc.com, 2.abc.com, etc.\n--- Note 1: the * and ?

Like the cloaking toggle, you have full control over what the hotkeys are (the .1 in the version number v0.46.52.1 = a fix so that any change to the Paranoid Hotkey combo is actually saved; .2 = tweaked Paranoid behaviour)\n- toolbar icon action now respects DP enabled state\n- tweaked hotkey visual display and fixed potential issue\n\nMoved full changelog from inception to: https://github.com/andryou/Decreased-Productivity/blob/master/changelog.txt"
