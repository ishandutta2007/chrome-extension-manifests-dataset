And type B sites where there's no search icon, but the extension doesn't jump to the search box as expected.\n\nTo set up this extension to work properly for type A sites, right click on the search icon that reveals the search box and select \"add this search trigger\" from the menu. After this, the extension will function properly on the site.\n\nTo set up for type B sites, right click on the search box and select \"add this search box\". After that, the extension will function properly."
