Ad Tracker provides a clean breakdown of the ad calls and responses on a page. Ad sizes, ad-units, keys and key values, advertiser ids, order ids, line ids and creative ids can easily be accessed using this extension. This tool can greatly benefit anyone working within the ad-operations industry (publishers, advertisers, agencies, and more). \n\nHow it works:\nOnce installed, load any site running ads through Google Publisher Tags into Chrome and you will see the Ad Tracker button in the bottom left hand corner of the browser window. Clicking this opens a popup in your current browser window in the bottom left hand corner.  This popup houses all the ad call/response info for quick and easy reference. The window can also be moved/resized and minimized/closed using the buttons provided. If you do exit the window you can access it again by reloading the page."
