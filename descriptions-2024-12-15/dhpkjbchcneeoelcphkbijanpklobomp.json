These tweaks can be saved against accidental refreshes and reset if user required to see original webpage.\nIn a designer-developer ecosystem, web-designers need to tweak a lot of small and big contents over a webpage. We(the developers) needed a way to allow our designer peers (and also a generic user) to make changes over a hosted webpage to see the influence at the shortest amount of time, and decrease feedback process timings. The Tweak extension allows web-designers to change and save a state of a webpage, as and how it is required as per designs. This makes the community more bonded and promotes a healthy culture.\nInstalling this extension, users especially designers find it way easier to point out ways to improve a hosted webpage by changing content, save against a refresh and clearing as and when they require it from their local systems(localStorage).This extension not only works over https but also localhost ports and privately hosted webpages, so it can be used by anyone and everyone in the industry. \nMoreover, people want the power to change content on a webpage so often and they wish what if the banner was a little bit to the right or left, this extension makes it possible for that user to do the changes in realtime also get the changes back with a refresh, moreover if they want to reset everything as it was, clear changes option allows them to do the same. We developed this extension to enable users tweak the webpages contents according to their wish, see the content again against successive refreshes, and clear changes if at all they don't like it. \nThe extension gets activated on every tabs refresh action, on a refresh, the functionality turns on the design mode (document.designMode = 'on') and allows user to make changes to the webpage as and how required, after making changes extension allows to confirm changes in order to turn off the design mode(clicking confirm changes turns off the design mode; document.designMode = 'off'). Now the user have an option to save the changes done on entire page after confirmation. This is achieved by usage of localStorage. The innerHTML of the entire webpage is stored on the localStorage of browser in a Stringified JSON format. This same or changed JSON string is retrieved from localStorage on subsequent refreshes unless ClearChanges is clicked, by which localStorage is cleared using the .clear() function. On a refresh, extension take string from the key puts it over the DOM structure as inner HTML showing the webpage as influenced."
