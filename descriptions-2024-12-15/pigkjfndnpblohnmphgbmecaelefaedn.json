Useful to find the best ads and to weed out fake ones.\n\nOnce you install this plugin additional intractable elements will appear on the listing and ad page. See screenshots from description of the plugin.\n\nSearches are done in foreground in a human like fashion. You will need to allow popups from publi24.ro in order for the search functionality to work.\n\n** FEATURES **\n\n> 🔍 PHONE BASED SEARCH \nWith a single button click search google for the ads phone number. All results are filtered and shown under the ad after the search is done. Tab is opened automatically to do a google search, and once results are collected it is closed automatically as well.\n\n> 🖼️ IMAGE BASED SEARCH  \nWith a single button click search all of the images of the ad on google lens. Result links are filtered and are added under the ad. Tabs are opened for image search and once results are collected they are closed automatically. Links are neatly displayed in a compressed format with chips only showing the domain. Images from the same domain get a number starting from `2` and are displayed right after the main one. Images from domains that are suspect are slightly red. \n\n> 👻 HIDE ADS\nHide ads that you deem not useful to you. These will have less opacity and you will know next time to ignore them.\n\n> SMART HIDING: \nWhen you hide ads the phone number will also be blacklisted. Further phone revealing on other ads with the same phone number will automatically be hidden, so that you are not wasting time on duplicate ads.\n\n> FOCUS MODE:\nAfter using the plugin for a while you will find that most of the ads you have already hidden. Enable focus mode so you can focus only on the ads that were not yet analyzed or which you have not hidden yet. This way you can avoid scrolling through whole pages with only hidden ads.\n\n> FLAGGING\nYou get a special message if images of the ad are found on other active ads from different cities. Publi24 image links that are not found (404) are grayed.\n\n> LISTING PAGE IMAGE SLIDER\nThe plugin overrides the functionality of the main image of the ads from the listing page. Now instead of opening the ad page it opens a modal with all the images in a slider. This makes your search more faster as you don't have to navigate away from the listing page just to see all the pictures. The image slider modal allows you to quickly execute Hide or Image search as the buttons are replicated.\n\n> FAVORITES\nBuild a list of favorite ads that most appeal to you. Once you are done sifting through the ads you can view the favorite ones in a modal. Favorite ads with the same phone number are grouped together.\n\n> DUPLICATES\nAs you keep investigating the different ads you will also be able to see duplicates with the same phone number. Easily compare all ads from the same phone number, especially the images, to further evaluate if it is the one you are searching for.\n\n> PHONE SEARCH\nThere are cases when you had a phone number saved and you want to quickly see if there are any ads with that number. Or maybe you are just collecting some statistics of a phone number. You can search for a phone number and list all ads that have it by pressing the blue button near the favorites modal button. \n\n> PHONE NUMBER QR CODE\nIn the favorites modal you will additionally get a QR code that can be scanned with your phones camera, to quickly transfer the phone number to your phone, as you are preparing to message or call the respective person.\n\n** All data is kept only on your local computer. All data persists in time.\n** Plugin can be installed and is functional on Yandex mobile browser, since that browser is chromium based."
