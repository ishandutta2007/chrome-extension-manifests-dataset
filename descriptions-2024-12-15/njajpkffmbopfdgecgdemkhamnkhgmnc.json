This extension doesn't work on 'Chrome Web Store' and 'chrome://*/*' pages !!\n!! Disable and re-enable extension require refreshing pages to let the extension take effect, also if the extension doesn't work on normal pages after installation, refresh the page or relauch the browser !!\n\nBrowser extension that saves tabs in group temporarily.\n\nHave you ever opened too much tabs in your browser? When we are working, we will usually open many tabs that're about a single subject. Unfortunately, sometimes we can't finish the work at once and need to keep those tabs open. As the tabs accumulate, it becomes a mess. And this extention aims to solve this problem.\n\nThe new Edge browser has already have a built-in functionality called Collections, which I think is very practical. So this extension is pretty much referencing the Edge Collections.\n\nIf you have any problems, you can contact me through email.\nAnd this extension is Open-source.
