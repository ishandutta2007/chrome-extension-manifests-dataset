Why should the user have to go to a whole separate webpage, instead of seeing hints info on the spelling bee page itself? Better yet, why not provide hints based on which words still remain unfound, so that the user doesn't have to sift through irrelevant information?\n\nThis extension provides the spelling bee player with a better hints experience. Once the user decides they are ready for hints, they will conveniently appear on the spelling bee webpage, and they will update with each newly found word.\n\nHappy bee-ing!\n\n(App icon was mostly designed by Freepik.)"
