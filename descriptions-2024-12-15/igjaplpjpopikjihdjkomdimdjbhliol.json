This key is generated on your device and without it; no one can access your data. \n\nKeep your passwords in one place on all your devices! Available on iOS, Android (SecureX app) via syncing via dropbox, google drive, icloud. \n\nUse our password generator, sync with cloud storage and other functions for a safe and convenient experience with our password manager. Despite the serious internal structure, the application interface is simple, friendly and intuitive.\n\nWhy are we a secure password manager?\n\nWe do not store your master password. Any access to your data is carried out using a unique personal secret key generated based on your master password and stored. No one else will be able to receive or read this data either during its transmission or in the storage.\n\nWe guarantee that your personal data is not sent to the network, is not stored or processed on our servers, therefore we provide the ability to use your personal cloud storage for synchronization, thereby eliminating the possibility of access to your data by third parties, while maintaining privacy, simplicity use and the ability to quickly recover. To ensure the safety of your data, we strongly recommend that you always use synchronization with your cloud storage.\n\nImportant: when a PIN code or master password is lost, its recovery is impossible, and data recovery is also impossible (this is due both to the security policy and the limited capabilities of encryption algorithms)."
