I used to do that by saving all these in a file and copy pasting them when I need one of them. Another problem was that every time I had to reload the page the token would get removed and I would have to apply the token all over again.\n\nSo I made this extension to do all these. It can apply token in swagger UI page. Or it can copy to clipboard.\n\nFeatures -\n- Ability to apply token in the swagger ui (the website)\n- Ability to copy token to clipboard.\n- Ability to add profile with token\n- Ability to edit or delete profile"
