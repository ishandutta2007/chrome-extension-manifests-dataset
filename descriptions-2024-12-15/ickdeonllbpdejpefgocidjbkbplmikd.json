Are you tired of having ASMR videos mixed with the regular ones? If so, this extension is for you!\n\n\"ASMR filter for Youtube\" adds a new button near the Youtube logo. With it, you can quickly choose to hide either category of videos (ASMR or non-ASMR), instantly switching between regular, ASMR-free or ASMR-only versions of Youtube.\n\nIt acts on:\n- homepage, explore, subscriptions pages\n- channel pages\n- correlated videos \n- the wall that appears at the end of each video\n- playlists and subscriptions on the leftside menu\n- playlist contents (in the \"visualize playlist\" page and while playing)\n\nASMR content is identified by looking for the \"ASMR\" string, either in the video title or channel name. To my experience, this correctly identifies all elements.\n\nPRIVACY NOTICE:\nI do not collect any information or data and I don't use any 3rd party service.\nConfiguration is saved either locally or within Chrome's sync storage.\n\nCONTACT\nContact me at https://duri.tk/#contact"
