The extension is an addition to the language learning platform https://zeeguu.org.\n\nZeeguu allows you to enrich your vocabulary in a foreign language while you browse the web and read articles that are interesting to you. It supports you in the following way: \n\nYou read articles in the language that you want to practice; these could be articles on news sites, blogs, or encyclopedias like Wikipedia.\n\nFor better readability, the extension removes all excess clutter, like adverts, buttons, and videos from the article, and instead offers you one-click translation and pronunciation for the words you donâ€™t know.\n\nZeeguu then generates personalized vocabulary exercises by using the original context in which you encountered words that you didn't understand. We do this because contextual learning works better.\n\n\nTo benefit from Zeeguu you should preferably have a basic knowledge of the target language.\n\nYou are welcome to contact us at zeeguu.team@gmail.com with ideas of improvements or requests for help."
