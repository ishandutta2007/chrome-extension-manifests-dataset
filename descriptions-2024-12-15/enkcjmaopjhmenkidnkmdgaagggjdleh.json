It displays an interesting fact of the day, the astronomy photo of the day, realtime location of the ISS on an interactive map, and a list of astronauts currently in space with extra information about each astronaut.\n\nThe extension's main purpose was to serve as my final project for Harvard's CS50x course. It was inspired by my love for space and I hope that it can extend (pun fully intended) that interest to other people."
