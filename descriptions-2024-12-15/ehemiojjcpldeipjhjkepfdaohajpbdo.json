It is a tool to be used in conjunction with these tools. Firebug Lite provides the rich visual representation we are used to see in Firebug when it comes to HTML elements, DOM elements, and Box Model shading. It provides also some cool features like inspecting HTML elements with your mouse, and live editing CSS properties.\n\n\n\n\nUpdates\n-------------\n\n18th August 2019 : \n\n* Better error messages when a security policy of a website prevents Firebug from being injected\n* Better error messages when Firebug didn't load yet, and is being executed on a website before it was reloaded\n* Fixed issue where clicking on \"Inspect with Firebug Lite\" on right click would do nothing\n* Added donation and rate extension links in context menu - thank you for supporting old extensions\n\n23th January 2019 : \n\n* Fixes for newer Chrome versions\n\n28th June 2018 : \n\n * Updated to Firebug Lite 1.5\n * Fixes to make it work with Angular\n * Fixed missing images\n * Small bugfixes\n\n\n\nBenefits over Firebug Lite bookmarklet\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n  * Browser toolbar integration\n  * Able to activate Firebug Lite for a particular domain\n  * Firebug Lite will be loaded before all other scripts, allowing it to capture all console calls, and all XHR requests for that page\n  * It is faster to load, because all code and images will be store in the extension's directory in your machine\n  * Will be able to read external resources in the next version\n\n\nLimitations\n----------------\n\n * Cannot read external resources\n * Won't work well on pages with frames\n * JavaScript debugger isn't available\n * Net Panel isn't available\n\n\nActivation\n--------------\n\nThe Firebug Lite activation scheme is very simple. When you first visit a web page, Firebug icon will be grey, indicating that it is deactivated. Clicking on it will activate Firebug for all pages in that domain, and the icon will become orange.\n\nTo deactivate for a particular domain, go to a page in that domain, and click on the \"off\" button.\n\n\nContributing\n-----------------\n\nYour contribution is very important. Found a bug? Please \nreport it in the support forum here\n\nHave a suggestion? Have a problem? Same thing\n\nIf you would like to help with some code, or develop an extension for Firebug Lite, don't hesitate, join our team."
