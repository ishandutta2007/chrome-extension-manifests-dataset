Extract Job Details with One Click: From a growing list of supported sites, the extension quickly extracts the URL, Job Title, and Company Name from job descriptions.\n2.) Effortless Form Filling on job-room.ch: When you navigate to job-room’s \"Efforts to find work\" -> \"Enter\" page, the extracted details are automatically filled in, using the most commonly selected additional settings.\n\n## Additional Features:\n1.) View Extracted Job Information: Right-click the extension icon to see the currently extracted Job Title and Company Name.\n2.) Toggle Form-Filling: You can enable or disable the automatic form-filling feature. When disabled, the extension icon changes to include a stop sign, giving you a clear visual indicator.\n3.) As URLs getting shorter during extraction, sometimes important search arguments are thrown away and the resulting URL won't point anywhere. If you want to make sure that the URL works for the particular domain, you can set the action in the right-click menu to:\n- \"Nothing\", this is the default, doesn't do anything with the URL\n- \"Push to clipboard\", the cleaned URL is pushed to the clipboard, and you can paste it to the browser line on a new tab easily\n- \"Reload with URL\", will reload the actual tab with the URL\n4.) If you want to move fast, instead of clicking the icon, you can use Ctrl (Command on Mac) + Shift + E, to do the data extraction from the active/focused tab (if you click inside the site, it will be focused). In order to set it up, click the \"Enable Extraction Shortcut\" menu item in the right-ckick menu. You can disable it if you want with the \"Disable Extraction Shortcut \"\n\n## A Growing List of Supported Sites\nNot every job description page is supported yet. If you come across a page that isn’t working, please feel free to send the link to swisskristof@gmail.com, and I’ll notify you once support is added.\n\n## My Mission\nI understand how stressful and time-consuming job searching can be, which is why I created this extension to make the process just a bit easier for you. My goal is to save you valuable time and effort, so you can focus on what matters most: finding the right opportunity.\n\n## Support Options (Optional)\nThis extension is completely free, and there is no obligation to support me. However, if you find it helpful and want to show your appreciation, here are a couple of ways you can support my work:\n\n- Give up to 5 stars review above\n\n- Buy Me a Coffee: A small contribution from the app menu would be greatly appreciated and help keep this tool free for everyone.\n\n- LinkedIn Recommendation: If this extension has made your job search easier, a recommendation on LinkedIn would be incredibly meaningful and help me grow professionally.\n\nYour support, whether through a kind word, a donation, or a LinkedIn recommendation, is entirely optional but deeply appreciated. Thank you for considering it, and I hope this extension makes your job search just a little less stressful!"
