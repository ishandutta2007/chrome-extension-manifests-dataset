No lengthy onboarding. No configuration headaches. No separate logins. Developers stay in an environment they love, and Project Managers get total visibility into the development process.\n\nOver 8000 software teams trust Zenhub’s powerful browser extension to help them ship better software.\n\nVisualize Issues & Track Dependencies - Multi-Repo Task Boards allow you to track and provide transparency into your development process using existing GitHub data. Drag and drop Issues between pipelines, filter by labels, assign Issues, view Issues linked with Pull Requests, visualize blockers with Issue dependencies, and much more.\n\nPlan Sprints & Epics - Epics let you group multiple GitHub Issues together for better planning and tracking and collaborating on product backlogs. Use GitHub Milestones to create sprints, then add story points to track progress.\n\nActionable Reports - Release Reports, Velocity Tracking, and Burndowns all enable more accurate predictions and continuous improvement insights. Determine team pace and efficiency, detect trends to improve processes, and measure the value delivered to end-users.\n\nNot using Chrome or Firefox?
