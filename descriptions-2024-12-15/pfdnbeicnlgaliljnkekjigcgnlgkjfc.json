To choose a context for opening the app, please right-click on the toolbar button and then select your desired context. Please note that all changes are stored in the memory.\n\nOnce the app is open, please add a text in the text area within the app (bottom section). Next, click on the right-arrow button next to the text-area to generate the QR code. To see the last 10 generated QR codes, please click on the left sidebar. If you click on each item in the sidebar, it will be rendered on the main screen. On the top-right corner, there is a download button to download the current QR code as an SVG image file. Below that, there are reload (to reload the UI), support, and donation buttons.\n\nNote: you can also select a text on any webpage and then right-click and choose - Generate QR Code - from the context menu to generate a QR code.\n\nIf you found a bug to report, or have a feature request in mind, please fill the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/qrcode-generator.html)."
