No integration is required with your system.  All it takes is less than a 1-minute screen mapping, and you are ready to use PowerFill.\n\nPowerFill eliminates data entry errors and reduces customer wait times.\nExample Use Cases:\n• Hospitality - Reduce guest check-in time by scanning a driver's license into your web-based PMS system.\n• Visitor Management – Visitors can scan their driver's licenses, so they don’t have to enter the information manually.\n• Rental Agencies – Accurately capture information from customers' driver's licenses.\n\nThese are just a few example use cases, but PowerFill works with ANY online form without programming or integration.\n\nHow it works:\n• First, map the driver's license fields you need to capture to the fields on your web data entry form.  Simply click on a field on the PowerFill screen, then click on the corresponding field on your form.  It’s that easy, and you only need to do this the first time you use PowerFill.\n\n• With your web form displayed in your browser, insert a card into the scanner and click on the PowerFill extension icon.\nThat’s it!  In seconds, the license is scanned, data is extracted, and your form is automatically filled.  It’s fast and accurate!\n\nRequirements:\n• Plustek D620 ID Card scanner or Plustek SecureScan X-Cube ID reader\n• Plustek PowerFill license. Contact InfoUSA@PlustekUS.com for more information.\n\nNote:\n* PowerFill does not support PDF forms.\n* PowerFill only works with the Windows Chrome browser.\n\nWhat our customers are saying:\n\nOwner of a family-owned hotel: “I’ve reduced the amount of time I spend manually entering guest information into our Property Management System by almost 70%.  I can spend more time focusing on the guest instead of entering data.”\n\nFront desk manager at a technology distributor: “Before PowerFill, our visitors had to manually enter driver's license data into our visitor management system.  There were tons of errors, and frequently it took users a few tries to get their data entered correctly.  Now all they do is to insert their license into the scanner, and the fields are filled out automatically.”"
