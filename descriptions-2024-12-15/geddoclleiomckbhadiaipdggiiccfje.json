SEO specialists can simulate how non-JavaScript search engines view a page, helping identify indexing issues. Itâ€™s also valuable for privacy-focused users and accessibility testers to assess a siteâ€™s functionality without JavaScript, and for quickly comparing page load speeds with and without dynamic elements.\n\nWorks with any URL scheme, including domains, subdomains, IP addresses, localhost, and local .html files!\n\nNote: The Pause/Resume feature has been temporary disabled since 2.1 because too many users complained about the required 'debugger' permission.\n\n__________________________________\n\nWorks with Chrome 88+\n(for Chrome <88, use the v1 version)\n\nPermissions: \nA detailed topic about why QJS need them (TLDR: didn't have choice for good UX):\nhttps://github.com/maximelebreton/quick-javascript-switcher/issues/74\n\nTroubleshooting with v2: \nSome users experience issues with the v2 update, which can often be resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling the extension. I apologize for this inconvenience.\n__________________________________\n\n/* Log info */\n2.2.0\n=====\n- Fix toggle problem due to existing rules from v1 version\n- Fix problem with ip adresses\n\n2.1.0\n=====\n- Play/pause js feature has been removed because it requires a new permission (debugger), and many users complain about this new permission\n- Fix bug with localhost and ip adresses\n- Allow/block/clear behaviour is back\n\n2.0.2\n=====\nFix bug with toggle when trying to clear rule, now it's the classic allow/block behaviour, instead of allow/block/clear\n\n2.0.1\n=====\nFix bug with old rules, conflicted with new rules (so the click on the icon doesn't toggle)\n\n2.0.0 (Major version, compatible with Chrome 88+)\n=====\n- Based on new Chrome security policies (manifest v3)\n- New icon design\n- [new] Allow / block by domain or subdomain \n- [new] Pause JS without refreshing!\n- [new] Options panel to edit rules\nAnd many other improvments\n\n1.4.12\n=====\nFix bug with chrome 91+: https://github.com/maximelebreton/quick-javascript-switcher/issues/45\n\n1.4.4\n=====\nSmall fixes and promotion for the next release!
