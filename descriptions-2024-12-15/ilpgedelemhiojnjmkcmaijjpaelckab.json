If you have issues with people not getting tagged in a reply but in a separate comment you might want to try to turn on this option (the whole tagging process becomes slower)\n-You can now close the popup by clicking next to it\n-Added a warning about the dangers of tagging to many people at once (if you have more information about this I would love to hear from you)\n\nMight be buggy, so any kind of feedback would be greatly appreciated!"
