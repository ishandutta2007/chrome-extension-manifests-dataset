It also lists your most viewed videos.\n\nBy default, a view is counted at 50% of video length, but it can be changed under options.\n\nYou can display your most viewed videos by clicking your name in top right and then \"Most Viewed\" (if you're signed in) or \"Most Viewed\" in left column on main page.\nAlternatively, use these keyboard shortcuts:\n* Ctrl/Cmd + M to open/close Most Viewed\n* Left and right arrow key to navigate between pages of Most Viewed\n* Esc to close Most Viewed\n\nNB! It doesn't show your video views before using the extension.\nViews are saved locally and no data is collected by this extension.\n\nChangelog\n26.04.2013 - version 2.6\nFixed bugs: view count was displayed multiple times and view count was reversed.\n\n18.04.2013 - version 2.5\nExtension can once again record your views. Fixed 'Most Viewed' Next/Prev button.\nNB! Use \"Send feedback\" in case of problems or bugs.\n\n16.12.2012 - version 2.4\nExtension is now compatible with new YouTube UI.\n\n18.11.2012 - version 2.2\nFixed it - extension works again!\nViews are now counted also on user (channel) pages.\n\n01.09.2012 - version 2.0\nStability fixes. Use \"Send feedback\" link in case of problems"
