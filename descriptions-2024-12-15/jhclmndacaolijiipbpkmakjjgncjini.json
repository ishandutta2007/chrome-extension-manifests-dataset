However, the problem is that the GitHub Flavored Markdown will not render your diagram. This kind of defeats the purpose of using Mermaid.\n\nThis extension solves that dilemma by scanning your markdown documents for Mermaid code blocks and replacing them with the actual diagrams. So you can keep reaping the benefits from diagrams-as-code yet get beautiful rendered diagrams when you read and share your markdown document on Github.\n\nEtymology of the word Merâ€¢cat:\nIt is a portmanteau of the words \"Mermaid\" and \"OctoCat\", the Github mascot. It sounds a bit like \"meerkat\", so that's what I call it and that's what the logo comes from."
