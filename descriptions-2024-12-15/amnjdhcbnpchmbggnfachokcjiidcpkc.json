This Codeforces Get Rating extension helps users to just view the problem rating without seeing the other tags. But if you are stuck with any problem then you can view the tags by clicking on Show All Tags button. The extension also includes a shortcut to go to the Contest Standings directly.\n\nThis extension is very helpful while practicing problems on Codeforces as it helps you to know the rating of the problem without explicitly knowing the tags associated with it.\n\nHow to use : \n1. Install the extension.\n2. Turn off [ Show tags for unsolved problems ] option in the Problemset page of codeforces.\n3. Open any Codeforces problem and it will show the problem rating.\n\n*NOTE* The extension does not work when the Codeforces API is down.\n\n*NOTE* The extension does not work with problems that do not have a problem rating.\n\n[ Screenshots for all the cases are attached ]\n\nUPDATE 1.0.1\nNow you will be able to visit the Contest Standings from the problem page itself with the click of a button.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.3\nFixed issues with problem parsing.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.4\nNew feature to Show All Tags for a problem."
