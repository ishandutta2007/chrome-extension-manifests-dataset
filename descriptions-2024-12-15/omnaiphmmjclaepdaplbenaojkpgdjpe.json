Full reply forms on the same page at the bottom of threads. http://i.imgur.com/4p7IE.png \n\n2. Toggle every feature to your liking! http://i.imgur.com/FZRBK.png \n\n3. Full emoticon list next to the form, no need to open additional window to insert emoticons => http://i.imgur.com/Hjl5j.png \n\n4. Fixes to CSS, includes bigger buttons in forms with proper hover effects and reworked pagination buttons to make them easy to click ( http://i.imgur.com/nFP61.png ) \n5. Spoiler open confirmations, when opening a spoiler for the first time, a user will be asked if he really wants to open it. (Option togglable) \n6. Remembering and restoring post messages on server-side failures when using full reply form. Now also survives accidental page refreshes and navigating to a different page entirely (thanks to shole for this! Smile )"
