Malicious websites is a websites that directly promote malware, or try to steal your credentials (phishing websites) or perform any other illegal activities. But potentially unwanted websites are different, they may not try to directly throw viruses at you, but they may try to promote their adware extension, for example: Remember websites that try to install their suspicious search engine? We flag them as potentially unwanted, as they may not directly harm your computer. However we also block websites with specific reasons, for example we can block specific URLs, like GitHub repositories that contain viruses, or another example, we can block specific YouTube video that promotes malicious content.\n\nWe made this all for your privacy and safety. About privacy, we don't store your personal information or track websites that you visit, we only gather information like your browser, operating system, etc. for the purpose of analyzing and improving our services.\n\nStopMalwareContent is completely free and open source, licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0 license.
