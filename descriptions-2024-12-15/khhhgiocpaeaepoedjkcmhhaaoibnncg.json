Application takes a simple alias and a secret (only piece of information you need to remember) and generates powerful password for you on the fly.\n\nExample:\n\nFirst of all we need a strong secret: \"s3cr3t!\"\n\nNow lets choose a service. Facebook.com is a good example. Alias for it could be: \"facebook\"\n\nWhen we enter \"facebook\" as alias and \"s3cr3t!\" as secret into password generator, we get this as a generated password:\n\"jZhMjJiZTc3YjBjZDI4NzZhMDgzMjg2N\"\n\nPretty good for a password, right? Now every time we enter combination of our alias and secret into the password generator, we get this phrase as our final password which we can use for Facebook.com.\n\nNeed another password? Lets take github.com as an example. Our alias could be \"github\". We already know the secret, no need to change that one. When we enter \"github\" as alias and \"s3cr3t!\" as secret, this is our new generated password:\n\"zUxMzlmMjg2NzU5NmEyYjIwMTBkYmM1N\"\n\nPretty cool, huh? 2 very strong and completely different passwords and all we had to remember was our secret (\"s3cr3t!\").\n\nAnd we can continue with additional services/aliases as we need. In the end we'll get strong and unique passwords for each service without all the hassle of remembering or writing down multiple password.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nPassword generation is done locally in your browser and no data leaves your computer. Extension doesn't observe your actions nor report anything anywhere.\n\nExtension is OPEN SOURCE, hosted on Github:\nhttps://github.com/michalsukupcak/Password-Generator-Chrome\n\nAnd so is the original webapp:\nhttps://github.com/michalsukupcak/Password-Generator\n\nIf you have any suggestions or feature requests, feel free to contact me or open an issue on Github!"
