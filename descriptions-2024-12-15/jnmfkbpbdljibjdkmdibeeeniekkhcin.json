Please note that this addon only works if the links have a third-party href, otherwise it won't change the attributes at all. By adding the noopener attribute, it can potentially improve your online security and privacy, as the third-party website does not have access to the opener window (the tab in which the hyperlink is opened), therefore your online data will not be exposed to other websites. \n\nThe toolbar button serves as an ON, OFF switch to quickly turn the extension ON or OFF. Badge icon text shows the number of hyperlinks that are being changed. This addon does not have separate options or settings page.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/link-protector.html)."
