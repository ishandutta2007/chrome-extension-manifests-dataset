Your data will not travel over the network, instead it will process in side the browser on the fly using JavaScript only. You can verify this by using FireFox in built console's network and storage tab.\n\nLoad external JSON file :  You can load any JSON file from your disk and also the file will not get uploaded into the server. It will get processed only in browser using JavaScript.\n\nSave loaded JSON file into disk : You can download/save the JSON as file into your disk by one click only.\n\nDifferent view in a single Editor : You can view your data in different mode in a single editor window by clicking the navigation or changing the mode drop-down menu. In the same editor window you can alter the object manually in code editor mode or using  object editor in Tree view.\n\nNote:  It is built using open source framework including {https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace},{https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv},{https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/},{https://getbootstrap.com/},{https://jquery.com/} ETC."
