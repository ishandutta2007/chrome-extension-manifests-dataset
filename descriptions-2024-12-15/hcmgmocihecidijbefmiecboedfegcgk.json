Should anyone want to continue the development of the extension, the full source code is available on my GitHub and will remain there. Click on the 'Website' link to find it.\n\nSorry for any inconvenience and thank you for using the extension thus far!\n\n=== Description ===\nSometimes you find yourself wanting a middle ground between the default YouTube video sizes and fullscreen â€” This extension offers just that. It adds a button within the YouTube player itself (and in the browser toolbar) that allows you to toggle a full windowed mode for your videos.\n\nDisclaimer! This extension was built around the new YouTube layout (https://www.youtube.com/new) and does not promise full functionality on the previous layout.\n\n=== Changelog ===\n# v1.1.0\nImproved initial load detection, fixed an issue with the Chrome extension icon not working properly and made sure the up-next functionality works as intended upon finishing a video.\n\n# v1.0.3\nImproved the YouTube navigation detection in order to make sure the extension is loaded on all video pages without having to refresh.\n\n# v1.0.2\nOnly loads the extension at the watch route, rather than all of YouTube\n\n# v1.0.1\nAttempt at solving an issue where the extension won't load at every refresh"
