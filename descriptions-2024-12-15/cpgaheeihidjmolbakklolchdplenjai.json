The “Download All” button added to Instagram accounts lets you bulk download all their posts in one click.\n\nNOTE: Please reload your Instagram tabs after installing or updating to load the extension.\n\nWhile browsing Instagram, just hover over a post preview and click the download button to save it. If there are multiple images/videos in the post, they’ll all be saved.\n\nIf you’re looking at a post or Reel, check next to the bookmark and share icons for the download button, or try the hotkey Ctrl + Shift + D or Cmd + Shift + D.\n\nA story can be saved with the download button in the top right corner.\n\nWhen downloading an entire Instagram account, you’ll be prompted to choose a folder.
