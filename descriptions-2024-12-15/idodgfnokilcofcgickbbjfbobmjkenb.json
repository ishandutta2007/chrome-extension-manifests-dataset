I got tired of having to click on these links all the time, just to wait for the page to load and all the ads to show. Never mind having to deal with the jankiness, popups, and different design that blogs and news sites have. So I made this to extract just the main reading content from those sites and inject it into the Reddit post for your viewing pleasure. I know â€” it's very heroic :)"
