I have published it on GitHub if others would like to continue working with it and help out the Funimation community. If you have any contributions I can add in, let me know and I can include them and your name if you like as a part of the team.\n\nhttps://github.com/N3FF/Funimation-Queue-Fix\n\nThis will fix Funimation's queue page. It will allow you to reorder your queue and save it. It replaces their dead image links with working ones, loads your whole queue at once, and has an up arrow added to the block that will move a series all the way to the top instead of dragging it.\n\nMight not work anymore: If you have shows that you are not able to add to your queue because it says \"Remove from Queue\" on shows that are not in your queue, you can now add them by turning it on and then hold \"Shift\" and put your mouse over the \"Remove from Queue\" and it will say \"Add to Queue\".\n\nIf you don't want your entire queue to load, and would prefer it to load by 8 shows, you can turn the extension off and only enable it when you want to reorder and save things."
