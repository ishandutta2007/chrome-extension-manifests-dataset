LiNotify enables you to \"follow\" certain LiChess users by visiting their lichess.org profiles and clicking on the LiNotify icon. Whenever the followed user comes online or starts playing LiNotify will trigger a system notification to alert you of the fact. \nAdditionally LiNotify shows you if any user statuses changed (came online/started playing), since you last checked, by displaying a number bellow the extension icon in the browser.\n \nNotification appearance and sound are entirely operating system dependent. In the extension options you can further control what notifications you would like to receive for certain users.\n\nYou want to contribute to LiNotify? Awesome! Check out the extension on github at https://github.com/mpunkenhofer/linotify\n\nI am not affiliated in any way with lichess.org."
