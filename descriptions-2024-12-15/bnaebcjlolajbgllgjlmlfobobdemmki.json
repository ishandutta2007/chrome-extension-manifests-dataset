It enables you to quickly create automated tests on your site, that can be replayed and shared by other members of your team. \n\nAll actions are driven from the browser, not from the Cloud. Boozang works equally well on a public site, behind you company firewall or testing on your localhost. All you need is an internet connection. Your project team is connected over web-sockets in the browser, meaning you can even share tests between development environments and production.\n\nThe main tool gives you access to developer functionality. Here you can loop over tests, link tests together, make decision trees based out assertion outcomes, and even inject Javascript.\n\nThe tool has built-in support for BDD using Cucumber/Gherkin, and can synchronize directly with features residing on GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, Azure or XRay/Jira. We have also added visual maps for outlining test dependencies. \n\nFind all documentation on http://docs.boozang.com and feature videos on the Boozang youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh1DvPtyZxxsoVyUY8eYjsw"
