This extension aims to personify this feeling, by granting a user the ability to express their obsession with the bee species at the push of a button.\n\nThe extension, upon activation, opens a window that begins playing an appropriate anthem of a bee lover, as well as showing an infinitely looping slideshow of bees. Suggestions for bee images to be added are welcome."
