This can include information about the user's device, operating system, browser version, installed plugins, screen resolution, and more.\nA combination of these attributes can be used to identify the user.\n\nWe want to safeguard the user against this profiling. Here is a Chrome extension that anonymizes the user.\n\n-It can spoof the navigator values. It replaces real value with dummy values.\n-It can protect against Canvas fingerprinting. It replaces canvas elements with a dynamically generated image, which is unique every time.\n-It can spoof the User Agent to a random device\n-Block Images\n-Block Javascript from running on pages\ntry out our Chrome extension here:\n-https://amiunique.org/\n-https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\n-https://browserleaks.com/canvas - for canvas fingerprinting\n\nPlease note that only one spoofing feature works at a time."
