The Facebook interface is filled with numbers.These numbers, or metrics, measure and present our social value and activity, enumerating friends, likes, comments, and more. Your friend count, the number of likes under a photo, how many messages you have waiting, etc...these are all Facebook metrics.\n\nFacebook Demetricator allows you to hide (and show) these metrics. No longer is the focus on how *many* friends you have or on how *much* they like your status, but on *who* they are and *what* they said. Friend counts disappear. '16 people like this' becomes 'people like this'.\n\nThrough changes like these, Demetricator invites you to try the system without the numbers, to see how your experience is changed by their absence. Thus, with this extension I aim to disrupt the prescribed sociality these metrics produce, enabling a network society that isn't dependent on quantification.\n\nFor more information, please see http://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/"
