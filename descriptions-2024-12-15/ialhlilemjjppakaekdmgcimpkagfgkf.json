It usually occurs when the laptop is running on battery.\n\nThis extension prevents such behaviour by adding a wake lock for every audio playing with a small reasonable timeout, so the next audio track could have a chance to start playing.\n\nThis extension worked for me for years, so I finally published it in hope it will fix this annoying issue for someone as well. But in no way it is guaranteed to work for you, simply because you might have some different cause of troubles on your system."
