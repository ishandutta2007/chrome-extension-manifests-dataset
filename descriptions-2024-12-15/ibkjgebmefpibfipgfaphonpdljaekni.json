You can also compare the code and the image side by side to identify any potential errors.\n\nImportant:\n\n--> The technology used to extract code from videos is called Tesseract, which may not always produce 100% accurate results.\n--> The accuracy will depend on the type of image captured. For better results, ensure that the video is played at the highest quality before selecting the region.\n--> All processing is performed locally, ensuring the privacy of your data.\n\nCredits:\n\nLinks to some of the features used by this extension:\n\nJcrop: https://github.com/tapmodo/Jcrop\nTesseract.js: https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js\nNeuicons (for the display icon): https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/487767/select-all\n\nCode Repository:\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/KaifHalak/CodeCapture-Chrome-Extension-MV3"
