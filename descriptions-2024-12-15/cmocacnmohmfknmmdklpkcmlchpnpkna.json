Have a lot of feeds that use clickbait headlines but don't provide a snippet of the article, forcing you to visit their slow site to see the content? This extension provides quick and easy parses and summaries of articles right on the Feedly page so that you don't have to navigate away from the site anymore.\n\nParsing allows you to see the full contents of the article without needing to load the annoying and slow stuff from the website: skip the auto-playing videos, pop-ups, cookie agreements, intrusive ads, and other distractions; just get right to the content and instantly start reading.\n\nSummarizing reduces that long article to just a couple of lines for quick and easy reading. Just make sure to sign up and get a free API key from SMMRY.com and add it in the extension options to enable it (free SMMRY accounts have a limit of 100 daily summaries and a 10 second wait time in between summaries).\n\nOther enhancements include: auto-parsing and auto-summarizing, scroll to tab end to close tab, and scroll to page end to 'Mark As Read'.\n\nStart improving your Feedly experience!\n\n====================================\n\n20/09/24 quick update: Every time the Feedly site makes a change, the extension needs to be updated accordingly as well to work properly. Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to properly update the extension in a while. Not sure when I will be able to get around to doing it, but it will probably be a rewrite of everything from the ground up, as well as Manifest V3 compliance. As of right now, most functions of the extension are non-functional. Please look forward to when it is operational again. Thank you for using the extension."
