It works by bolding the first half of each word, providing a distinct anchor point that could help readers follow the content more easily. Although the extension is designed with the idea that it may be helpful for individuals who find it challenging to concentrate, such as those who self-identify as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), it has not been clinically tested or approved for the treatment or diagnosis of ADHD or any other medical condition. By inheriting the color of the parent element, the bold text preserves the original appearance and design of the webpage. Try BeBold and see if this innovative approach to reading suits your style!\n\nPlease let me know if any sites you use malfunction while using this extension.
