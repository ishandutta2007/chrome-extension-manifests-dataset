Closed tabs are shown in a dropdown for quick access to recent items, but you can search the full history.\n\nYou can clear the tab history at any time with a single click as well to preserve privacy or clear out old data. \n\nPrivacy: This extension sends zero tracking information to the author, ad sites, or anywhere else. All data is stored locally in your browser.\n\n--\n\nThis extension is a fork of Sexy Undo Close Tabs, a great extension the author has abandoned. In current form it is nearly identical to the old extension but with ads insertion removed."
