Override caching policy that has been set on the server.\nSelect a host on which the caching is required and all requests from a page with that host will be cached.\n2. Caching of static content which are on a different host will also be cahed (read Note for further explanation)\n\nNote: say you have a site example.com on which you have set a caching policy thru the extension. Now if the any page on example.com links to external scripts and sites which are on a different domain such as static.example.com or ajax.googleapis.com, the extension will automatically apply the same caching behavior as that of example.com\n\nSource Code\nhttps://github.com/tusharmath/Super-Cache"
