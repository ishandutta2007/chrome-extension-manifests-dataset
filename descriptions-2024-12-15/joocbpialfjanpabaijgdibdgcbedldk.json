When enabled, Spoonie constructs spoonerisms out of text on pages you visit. It then replaces the original text with the spoonerized text. It should work on most sites, and is often quite funny!\n\nSpoonie is disabled by default. To enable/disable it, just click the icon. Once enabled, Spoonie stays enabled until you disable it.\n\nAfter you've enabled it (icon turns green), every page you visit will be spoonerized. When you disable it (icon turns gray), it reloads the current page to restore its original content.\n\nSpoonie is open-source, works entirely in your browser, has no servers, and makes zero network calls. Spoonie does not phone home because your browser is its only home."
