High stakes tests are conducted every year and sometimes twice or thrice a year, hiring a test invigilator for each test will only add on to the physical logistics. Hence quite naturally a feature like online proctoring will only remove a huge burden from the shoulders of the exam conductors.\n\nTechnology today is enabling exam admins, teachers, recruiters to see and hear the exam candidate, sitting thousands of miles away. Mettl is empowering these exam admins, teachers and recruiters with technology to do the same with our Advanced Proctoring Feature.\n\nUsing this extension exam admins can view the candidateâ€™s screen while proctoring the candidate live and post the exam in the candidate's report.\n\nAllowing a proctor to see everything on a candidate's screen is like saying a proctor at a physical test centre who can look over your shoulder, see your computer screen and prevent any restricted behavior.\n\nMettl doesnot have access to the candidate's screen after the exam is complete"
