You have to either look up each opened tab to check or search through your browser history. And the worst thing is the huge memory these opened tabs take which mostly leads to crashes. Well this extension then comes to your rescue.\n\nJust press Alt+2 to close and save the current tab (You can press Alt+1 if you don't want to close the tab) and the next time you require that tab, press Alt+3, type a keyword for that tab (Like \"Football Article\") and press Enter. This takes at max three seconds to switch between tabs, even when the number of tabs saved are in hundreds. To clear the current session of tabs, press Alt+4. Use Alt+3 to open and close pop-up. Check out the awesome UI in the images. I hope you like it.\n\nCheers"
