This add-on aims to make this happen.\n\nFeatures:\n\n -   Enable/Disable DNS blocking (Indefinitely or set time)\n -   Enable/Disable Logging (Indefinitely or set time)\n -   Add domain to Black/White -list (Exact, Wildcard and Regex)\n -   Update Gravity\n -   Restart DNS server\n -   Open Pi-hole admin in new tab\n -   Display version of Pi-hole\n\nThis add-on is ideal when you want to manage Pi-hole instance without disrupting your workflow. Or if you want to give access to Pi-hole to other users of network but web interface is too complicated for them.\n\n\nThis add-on controls Pi-hole via it's own server, which must be installed along Pi-hole instance. Instructions to install server can be found here : https://github.com/Kulda22/alanine. Installation is as easy as Pi-hole installation, we offer install script or docker image.\n\n\nThis add-on is opensource, check us at https://github.com/Kulda22/alanine-plugin."
