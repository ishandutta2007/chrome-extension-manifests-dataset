It fixes many of the resizing and positioning issues present in Blackboard.\n\nThis redirects to the old homepage on loading. The new homepage can be accessed in the top right if needed.\n\nAny deadlines on the Blackboard system coming up in the next 30 days are displayed on the left of the home page. Navigation links to the following are displayed below this: Student System, Timetable, Lecture Recordings, Exam Timetable, Exam Results, Library, SPOT, My Learning Essentials and Evaluation Kit.\n\nThe following themes are available in both light and dark mode: Default (Purple), Blackboard (Grey), Ocean (Light Blue), UoM Purple (Same Purple as UoM Logo), Art Deco (Green and Gold Pattern), Tron (Black and Neon Blue Pattern), Rustic (Reddish Brown), Camo (Brown and Green Pattern).\n\nCourse units on the home page are filtered by semester. The semester you are currently in will display by default.\n\nWhen first using the extension, it will warn you that it can read and change your data at online.manchester.ac.uk. It needs this access to apply style changes to the loaded page. No personal data is changed or stored.\n\nThe following URLs are whitelisted by the extension (Blackboard won't warn you that you're leaving the learning environment): https://zoom.us/, https://piazza.com/, https://www.sli.do/ and https://gitlab.cs.man.ac.uk/.\n\nAssessment paragraph entry boxes on dark mode by default display white text but will submit black text (clearly visible on standard Blackboard). If you change the text colour, the submitted text will be this colour. Be aware that a submission of white text is not clearly visible on Blackboard.\n\nThis is an open source project available at: https://github.com/mattmcnee/uom-restyle-extension. Provide feedback at https://uom-blackboard-restyle.web.app/.\n\nUpdates:\n1.23 - Header links now underlined when hovered\n1.22 - Fix for blackboard update\n1.21 - Course units on the home page are now filtered by semester\n1.20 - Improved styling on journal entry pages\n1.19 - Fixed errors logging to console and improved styling coverage\n1.18 - Embedded videos no longer exceed screen width on smaller screens\n1.17 - Fixed Kortext link and improved course slide layout\n1.16 - Replaced menu icons with new style"
