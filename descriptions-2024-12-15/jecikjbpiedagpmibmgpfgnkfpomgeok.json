You're not alone; I've experienced that frustration too. So, I thought, \"What if I could see this information directly on Steam?\"\n\nThis addon checks your game selections against a database, displaying current availability on Xbox Game Pass for PC and Console, Ubisoft+, EA Play, and EA Play Pro.\n\nEnjoy an ad-free experience with alike03's Subscription Info.
