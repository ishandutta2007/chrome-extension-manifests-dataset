These insights can then be used to make the website better and easier to use for you!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is website usability testing?\n\nWebsite usability testing is a method for evaluating how intuitive and easy to use a website is for its users, by collecting data on how they solve tasks and interact with the website during an online test. Users are notified about the nature of all collected data, and are asked to give explicit consent prior to entering the study.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to use the extension?\n\n1.  Install the extension into your web browser.\n2.  Visit the address of the Website Testing study provided by the study conductor.\n3.  The extension will record your interaction with the website (in the form of raw interaction \n     data, e.g. clicks, scrolls, and mouse movements).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhich data is being collected?\n\nUXtweak's Chrome extension collects data ONLY on the tested website.\n\nBased on the study settings, and the level of consent the user has given, UXtweak can collect the following data:\n⦁\tUser's interaction data from the tested website (mouse and/or keyboard events, such as the \n        cursor's location on the screen)\n⦁\tMetadata regarding the browser, operating system, device, and approximate location\n⦁\tIP address (special consent required for EU residents) - optional\n⦁\tUser's identification on the UXtweak platform (special consent required for EU residents) - \n        optional\n⦁\tForm inputs, such as e-mail addresses and phone numbers (special consent required for EU \n        residents) - optional\n⦁\tAudio recording (special consent required) - optional\n\nUXtweak takes users' privacy very seriously and is fully compliant with the GDPR. For more information, please visit the related section on the UXtweak's website here: https://www.uxtweak.com/legal/gdpr-compliance\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhich permissions does the extension ask for?\n\n⦁\tStorage permission - to store data about the study the user is currently participating in.\n⦁\tTabs permission - to determine whether the user is currently viewing the tab with the study, \n        and to be able to collect the data as well as display the Website Testing Task panel on the \n        website being tested.\n⦁\tScripting permission - to inject the recording code snippet into the website being tested.\n⦁\tHost permission – to allow a website to be tested as part of a Website Testing study (as the \n        extension cannot determine in advance which site is going to be tested).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelog:\n•\t1.1.3 – Add experimental support for cross-domain recording\n•\t1.1.2 – Prevent browser from suspending the extension during active study\n•\t1.1.1 – Prevent injection of content script to frames multiple times\n•\t1.1.0 – Support for recording of iframes added dynamically\n•\t1.0.2 – Support for recording of cross-origin iframes\n•\t1.0.1 – Update meta description\n•\t1.0.0 – First public release"
