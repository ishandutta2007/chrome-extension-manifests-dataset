It was made to give you instant access to all the information you could want on your Outkast. With this extension you'll be able to see their name, id, level, and mission status. You will also get an overview that will let you know if you need to send them on missions or not. \n\nThis extension also gives you the ability to create differen't groups of 4 or less making sending them on missions much easier.\n\nIf any bugs or suggestions contact Cynikal#0001 on the discord.\n\nOutkasts used in the promo banners are created using a tool by mvc.eth, they can be obtained through fusions, but were generated with the tool.\n\nThe functions to get your wallet are all set by you and it is stored locally in your web storage in order to load the outkasts tied to that ethereum wallet address. This does not give the extension any control over said wallet it's  the equivilant of someone pasting your wallet address on etherscan."
