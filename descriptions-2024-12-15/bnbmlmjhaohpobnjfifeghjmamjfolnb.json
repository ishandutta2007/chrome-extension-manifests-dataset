Safe by default, accounts are added in read-only mode, no seed phrase required until needed. You can add multiple accounts and the extension will show you the total sum of all your accounts. You can also manage your lockup-contract accounts and eventually take full control of your funds. It uses a novel API mechanism to connect to DApps, where *you* decide when to connect and when to disconnect from the webpage."
