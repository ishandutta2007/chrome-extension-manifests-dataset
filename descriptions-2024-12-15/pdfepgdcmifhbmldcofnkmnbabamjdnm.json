It allows the creation of groups (folders) to organise the repartition of your tabs.\n\n\nWith this extention, create groups and add tabs to them just with drag and drop.\nThen choose the group of tab you want work with. You will not be disturb by the other tabs.\nYou can switch to an other tab group anytime you want.\nJust close the group to close all the tabs inside it when you have finished to work with.\n\nNow the extention keeps your pinned tabs open.\n\nA git repository has been created. Fell free to fork or re-use it.\nSome part of the code are in french though (sorry).\nhttps://github.com/Conchylicultor/TabsFolder"
