The task you should be working is set as your new tab page. \n\nIt's comprised of two parts: a browser extension which replaces your new tab page and an Emacs package. The Emacs package runs a WebSocket server which the browser extension talks to. \n\nThe Emacs side is invoked with `org-newtab-mode'. This starts a WebSocket server which listens on `org-newtab-ws-port'. The browser extension connects in and will send an org-agenda match query which is then used by Emacs to find the top task to work on. On connection, the Emacs side will send in data for `org-tag-faces' used to color the task background in the browser extension. The Emacs side will send data over when it's either requested by the browser extension (when it first connects) or when a task is changed (clocked in/out, marked as done, etc).\n\nExtension is fully open source, AGPLv3 licensed.
