Simply type Yiddish phonetically and the correct letters will appear.\n\nBasically, you type in YIVO transcription and it outputs the correct Yiddish: typing 'sh' produces a ש, 'ay' produces ײַ, etc. Shtumer-alef and the final forms of khof, mem, etc. are automatically produced correctly. In addition to YIVO-compatible output, there is an option for an alternative orthography as used by the Algemeiner Zhurnal. \n\nThe functionality is closely modeled -- with a few minor modifications -- on that of the \"Yiddish Pasekh\" keyboard designed by Gyula \"Ziggy\" Zsigri for use with the software utility \"Keyman\".\n\nInspired by the work of Noyekh Miller, Shoshke-Rayzl Yuni, and Refoyel Finkl.\n\nPlease let me know about any bugs you find and any features you'd like to see by using the support options on the extension page.\n\nChangelog:\n0.8 -- added more robust backup functionality\n0.7 -- khirek-yud/shtumer-alef now added after tsvey-yudn (e.g., shneyik)\n0.6 -- in accordance with new security features removed inline javascript. updated jquery.\n0.5.0 -- added option to choose between \"YIVO style\" orthography and \"Algemeiner style\" -- where the latter differs from the former in that it employs the shtumer alef (rules taken from Dovid Katz's grammar), does not use the rafeh or pasekh-tvey-yudn, as well as some other minor changes. Also tried to fix some bugs.\n0.4.2 -- changed Twittify function name to Condense since it's actually useless in Twitter (their/Unicode's fault, not mine), fixed a bug that was inserting khireks in some cases extraneously, changed font of textbox\n0.4.0 -- added Twittify button, updated hints, fixed css bugs\n0.3.0 -- added full screen option, hints page, and checkbox to turn on/off Yiddish letters."
