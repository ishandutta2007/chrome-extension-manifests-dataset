It is designed to work on individual product pages, and it works for popular sites such as Amazon, Google Books and many others.\n\nHow it works: This extension loads the \"Add to My Books\" widget (http://www.goodreads.com/api/atmb_widget) using an ISBN or ASIN number scraped from the current tab. The extension is not designed for pages with multiple book identification numbers, and it will simply choose the first valid book identification number that it detects on the page. Since the extension is not limited to a specific book site, it requires the \"Your data on all websites\" and \"Your tabs and browsing activity\" permissions.\n\nThis extension is an upgraded version of the original Add to Goodreads extension.\n\nCode available here:\n\nhttps://github.com/stephensulzberger/add-book-to-goodreads"
