Want to avoid seeing spoilers from the new Game of Thrones episode? Look no further, this extension is the answer to all your prayers. \n\nThis extension will hide tweets that contain the key word you have provided. You don't need to worry about capitalisation either as we take care of that for you!\n\nBlocked tweets can be viewed by clicking on the blank area where the tweet should have been, but do so at your own peril, it could be another fidget spinner video.\n\nTo unblock a keyword, simply click on it.\n\nSo happy blocking, leave a review, and tell your friends so they can block all your duck face selfies."
