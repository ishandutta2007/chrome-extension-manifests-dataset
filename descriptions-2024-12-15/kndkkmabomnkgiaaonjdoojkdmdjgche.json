Just highlight any text on a webpage and right click to launch SpeedReeds! Using this tool, you may select a comfortable pace at which to read one word at a time. There is a highlighted letter for each word that you can keep your eyes focused on; allowing you to save time while reading by removing the need to move your eyes! Also, by doing this, you can avoid an internal phenomenon known as subvocalization whereby an individual mentally sounds out each word when reading text. This is a great tool to help you focus if you have ADHD or trouble focusing when reading text. Subvocalization is probably stunting your reading speed, so come try out SpeedReeds!"
