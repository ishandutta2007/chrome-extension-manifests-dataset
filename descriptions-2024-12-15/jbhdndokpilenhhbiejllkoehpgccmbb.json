A concept builder is a type of exercise we do in our freshman physics class at DHS. Other schools might also be doing concept builders but I don't know if they do or don't. Only use this if you want to piss your teacher off and possibly fail a test. I just made this because I was curious and had some free time. All the responsibility is on you :)\n\n\nLink to concept builders: https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Concept-Builders"
