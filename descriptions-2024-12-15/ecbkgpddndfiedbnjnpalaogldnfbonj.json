Each of your groceries has a price tag on. Each comes in a certain packaged weight. Still you don’t know the price you pay for your food. That’s because you need 2000kcal each day and the food price is given in £ per kg. What matters is the price/kcals, the real measure whether a food is expensive or good value. To find this number, you’d need to do some time consuming arithmetic. The Essential Food Label chrome extension does this calculation for you. The price/kcalories comes in two ways: price/kcal or Monthly Grocery Equivalent (MGE). The MGE is the total grocery cost if you bought all your food at a certain price/kcal. For example, a price of 0.1p/kcal does not mean a lot for you. We know that in a month a person consumes on average 30 days worth of 2000kcals. Using this piece of information, the 0.1p/kcal becomes a  60£/month grocery equivalent (MGE), or 60£/month grocery bill. That’s a number easier to understand.  \nThe first indicator we extract from the price and label is the price/kcal or MGE.\n\nYou want your food to be as simple as possible. The more ingredients on the product label, the more complex your food. The Essential Food Label counts the number of ingredients. The second indicator: Number of ingredients.\n\nYou want the taste of your food to reflect the real freshness and nutritional quality of the food you eat. Flavoring is the ingredient that distorts the real quality of the food you eat. Think of it as “cosmetic surgery for food”. The third indicator the Essential Food Label extracts tells you whether the groceries you chose contain or don’t contain flavoring. It reads as “Contains flavouring” or “Does not contain flavouring”.\nThe current version only works for Tesco Groceries in UK. Send us an email so that we can keep you updated about geographical expansion to other grocers or markets. \nThis extension is made to give you information about the value of your food, nutrition, freshness and food quality."
