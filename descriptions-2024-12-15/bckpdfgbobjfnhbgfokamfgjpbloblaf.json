There are 4 modes - Draw Everywhere, Underwater, Outer Space, and UGHHHHHHHHHH. Draw Everywhere mode allows you to draw over any webpage. You can draw a flower over the Wikipedia article about honeybees, or scribble all over some bad news. Underwater generates bubbles along your mouse path - as you move your mouse around the page, more and more bubbles will appear and float up to the top of the screen. Outer Space generates falling sparkles that make you feel like you're watching a meteor shower from some alien planet. UGHHHHHHHHHH is for when you just really need to give someone the finger - it generates middle finger emojis when you click on a page. In all modes, you are still able to use the website as intended, whether you want to click a link or write in a search bar or anything else. The extension does not collect any personal data. It is written using the P5.js library."
