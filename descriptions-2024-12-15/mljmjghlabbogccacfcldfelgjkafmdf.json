It’s designed to be fun and easy to use for kids and adults alike—perfect for an educational environment.\n\nLaunch the app and you’ll get the xylophone board quickly-no delays—so you can immediately start playing any tune you want.\n\nThe controls are what you would expect on a digital xylophone. Tap the keys with your fingers on touchscreen devices, press the corresponding numbers on a keyboard, or just click the colorful keys with your mouse. You can even slide over the board to hit consecutive keys, or use two or more controls at the same time.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of a xylophone’s sound is the sense of precision that comes from its lack of resonance. PlayXylo uses sound recordings from a real xylophone to give you that same feeling.\n\nThere are many ways to make the xylophone fit your use case. By default, a beautiful set of rainbow colors are used. In addition, there’s a Boomwhacker version for those using this colorset. A special Solfege mode is available, which replaces the pitch names with Solfege (Do, Re, Mi) to teach kids and students effective reading and singing of music. The chromatic scale is also available, giving you access to all the flats and sharps.\n\nDon’t know how or what to play? There is a community section that contains videos of how other PlayXylo users interact with the app for learning, teaching, or just playing. You can find it in the navigation menu.\n\nNo internet access? No problem! This app works even when you’re offline."
