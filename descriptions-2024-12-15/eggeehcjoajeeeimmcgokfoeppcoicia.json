This simple yet powerful extension helps you stay focused, manage your time effectively, and avoid burnout by working in structured intervals.\n\nKey Features:\nCustomizable Work & Break Intervals: Set your preferred Pomodoro duration and break times to fit your personal workflow.\nNotifications & Alerts: Receive friendly notifications when it's time to take a break or get back to work. Stay on track without constantly checking the clock.\nProgress Tracking: Easily track how many Pomodoros you've completed during the day to see your progress and keep motivated.\nSleek, Minimalist Design: Enjoy a distraction-free experience with a clean interface that integrates seamlessly into your workflow.\n\nHow It Works:\nThe Pomodoro technique is a proven time management method. You work for a set period (typically 25 minutes), followed by a short break (5 minutes). After four Pomodoro cycles, you take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes). This extension helps you follow this method with automated timers and notifications, so you can concentrate on your tasks.\n\nWhether you're studying, working from home, or tackling your to-do list, the Pomodoro Timer will help you manage your time better and stay productive throughout the day."
