Ragdoll hit is a funny and fun physics game. The task of each level is different, so you have to make good angle, power and timing to hit targets. The game has straightforward mechanics that are quick to learn, but will keep you coming back with a good challenge and some food for thought on your way through increasingly complex levels.\n\nEvery level has different obstacles and targets so that when you play, you never know what youâ€™ll be coming across next. The ragdoll physics add a little bit of humor to the game as characters bounce and ragdoll in often amusing ways to, well, your hits. Ragdoll Hit was built for those short gaming sessions, and you can be caught up and ready to play within a few minutes.\n\nIf you have any questions about our Ragdoll Hit Unblocked game extension or just want to give us some feedback, feel free to send us a message or write a review!
