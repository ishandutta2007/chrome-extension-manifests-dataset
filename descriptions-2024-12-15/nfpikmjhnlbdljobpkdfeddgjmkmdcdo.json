We are creating an intuitive application that will allow users to create test cases without writing a single line of code. We achieve this through our browser extension that we have created which allows testers to record events and behaviors of users in their browser and translate them in to simple executable tests. Testers can also add custom validations to their test cases accordingly on each step of the test case to validate if a element such as \"Text\" is visible or if the color of the button is appropriate etc. The goal of TestJet is to reduce test authoring time and help create stable test with minimum maintenance."
