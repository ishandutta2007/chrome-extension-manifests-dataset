The idea is small, digestible snippets of Vim that you can practice immediately in the built-in Vim terminal to aid retention. With the sum of these small parts adding up to something really great.\n\nOther Features:\n\nDark / light mode.\n\nDrag and drop files into the terminal to edit them. Use :export to download again (don't forget to :w to save).\n\nLightweight and efficient: The terminal only loads and executes when activated. And even then it's approximately 1mb of wasm. The entire bundle has been tree shaken and packaged with the idea of keeping it as small as possible.\n\nWhy vim:\n\nUbiquity: Vim or vi are standard on nearly every linux install. If you ever ssh into a remote you have an extremely powerful tool at your disposal.\n\nContext switching: Stay keyboard focussed without having to mess around with the mouse.\n\nImproving the state of your craft."
