Our platform now supports the new ChatGPT API.\nBy using your own OpenAI API key, you'll enjoy the following benefits:\n\n✔️ No more browser security checks. \n🚀 High availability and performance. \n🛡️ Data submitted through the API is no longer used for service improvements (including model training). \n🗓 A default 30-day data retention policy for API users, with options for stricter retention depending on your needs.\n💰 OpenAI's pay-as-you-go pricing is now even more affordable at only around $0.0005 per generated email. \n\nThis extension can communicate only with OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Gmail thanks to strict and granular permissions to ensure that your data is not shared or accessed by any other internet resources including EmoGPT.com. Put simply, it functions locally and only saves customization preferences as browser data 🔒\n\nQuickly generate email responses, follow-ups, cold outreach templates, or rewrite emails with a high level of personalization and empathy. EmoGPT is designed exclusively for Gmail to enhance user experience and minimize effort in crafting personalized emails. Best of all, it's completely free for personal use, and always will be 🤗 \n\nBuilt with ❤️ in Ukraine 🇺🇦"
