There are several metrics such as average decision time and probability of acceptance after revisions that are critical for our study. Unfortunately, journals don't usually publish these statistics, so we're calling upon the academic community to share their manuscript submission experiences and help us build our dataset. We've built this Chrome extension to streamline the data collection process. Just go to your author submission portal, login to Coauthor and the extension will automatically collect the data, no manual entry required. Currently supports any journal that uses ManuscriptCentral as a submission site.\n\nContributor's Guide: https://coauthor.fly.dev/Contribute\nExplore the dataset: https://coauthor.fly.dev/"
