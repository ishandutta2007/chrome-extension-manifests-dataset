As I was transitioning from Firefox, where I had installed the \"Wiktionary and Google Translate\" add-on, to Chrome, I needed an extension for looking up words. Something that annoyed me about all the look-up extensions I tried, is that you need to select the word you want to look up, making it impossible to look up words in links! This extension fixes that by letting you simply hover over the word of interest, then pressing <CTRL> + <SHIFT> to show the definition of the word.\n\nAdditional functionality:\n- In the inline window it is possible to continue navigating to other word definitions, to get a better understanding of the word.\n- It is also possible to look up multi-word phrases by selecting the phrase with the text cursor before clicking <CTRL> + <SHIFT>.\n- Supports any language and any word written in the Latin alphabet! (As long as there is a Wiktionary entry for that word)"
