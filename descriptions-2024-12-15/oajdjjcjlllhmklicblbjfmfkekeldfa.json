Also included in the application are spot rates to help calculate estimate fees for basic transactions across 3 different speed preferences. (Spot rates sourced from centralised exchanges).\n\nGastly was made to replace extensions like GasNow and provide a non-invasive utility tool to quickly see gas prices as well as spot rates for your favourite fiat-ETH market pairs sourced from markets with deep liquidity. You may set your default option of gas price to 3 different speeds based on your preference. Fiat-denominated fees (of basic transactions) are also produced on the fly as real-time gas prices stream into the application.\n\nIf you enjoy this free product, please consider donating some ETH or DAI as I look to further enhance the product!\n\nEthereum Address: 0x33e9BA56E53fD12Bcc126ce9b28d1843CAE71C10\n\nFeel free to follow me on twitter for more crypto-related projects and thoughts:\nhttps://twitter.com/mark_mkzo"
