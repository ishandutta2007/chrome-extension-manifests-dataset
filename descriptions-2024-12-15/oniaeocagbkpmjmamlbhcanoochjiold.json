Those pop up windows aren't their own window or alert window. This tries to remove all of them. Annoyed with pages asking you to sign up with newsletters? Hate it facebook has a big annoying window to ask you to sign in when you just want to look at a post? Tired to being forced to click \"agree\" in a terms and conditions popup so you can view a page? Me too. Got so tired of it I took time to make this.\nPlease be aware that some pages/web app require modals to function.\n\nYou can also:\n\n    Whitelist/ignore list of hosts that you don't want to disable modals on.\n    Set custom domain and patterns list.\n    Turn off automatic removal and disable modals on a per-page basis.\n\n    Add to Apply list to only disable modals on certain sites\n\n    Set what css style to apply to what element on what page\n\n    Stop auto playing videos\n\n    Skip previously unskippable videos\n\n    Finer video forward and rewind capabilities. \n\nThe source is found here: https://github.com/sleepingkirby/butWhyMod\n\nversion 2.7:\nAccidentally over optimized code, causing the skip button to not work. Fixed.\nversion 2.6:\nEven better advance controls. \n-advance controls and overrides only apply when mouse cursor is over a video.\n-Shift, ctrl and alt can be used in combination. i.e. shift+ctrl+right arrow means video is forwarded by 21 seconds (shift=20, ctrl=1. 20+1)\n*note* please note that key overrides in browser DO NOT override OS level key binds. This means if the OS uses ctrl+alt+right arrow, this will NOT override that.\nversion 2.5:\nWhen the \"skip\" button option is turned on, any video that's moused over once will have finer video advanced forward and rewind capabilities.\nShift+arrow keys= 20 sec, arrow=5 sec,  ctrl+arrow=1 sec, alt+arrow=0.1 sec\n*note* this will override default actions/key presses.\nversion 2.4:\nAt the request of \nhttps://github.com/sleepingkirby/butWhyMod/issues/2\nchanged how the manual prune/auto prune button works.\nversion 2.3:\nMade skip button on videos fade away after 3 seconds\nFixed video evaluation where videos report non-finite duration.\nFixed skip button position calculation on screen resize.\nversion 2.2:\nAdded ability to stop auto-play videos and skip unskippable videos.\nFixed some evaluation and bugs.\nversion 2.1:\nMade function run on all elements, not just div's\nChanged style to dark mode to make it easier on the eyes\nFixed domain styling evaluation bug.\nversion 2.0:\nAdded Settings export function\nFixed typo\nversion 1.9:\nAdded Applylist to set what domains you want it to run on.\nAdded the ability to style element[s] on specific pages to whatever you'd like.\nversion 1.8:\nBug: chrome's javacript handles substr(0,-1) differently. Fixed\nversion 1.7:\nSmall bug fixes.\nAdded ability to use regex for [class names] in settings. This allows for patterns and, more importantly, multiple names to match on per host.\nversion 1.6: \nAdded removal of elements by ID matching.\nIncreased element types to prune as modals."
