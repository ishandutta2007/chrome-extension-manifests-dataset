The extension will clearly  highlight races where the place book is over broke. This helps to identify races with potential for each way sniping. Can also be applied to any sports event that offers an each way market (golf, football outrights, other outrights etc). If the bookie is offering extra places or there is a short favourite then these markets sometimes can present each way value."
