Consequently, openly available automated FAIR assessment services have been working on standardization of FAIR metrics. Moreover, Digital Competence Centers and Universitiy Libraries have been central in moving towards digitization of services. However, in practice, using the FAIR assessment tools is still an intricate process for the average researcher. It requires a steep learning curve since, disengaging some researchers in the process.\n\nWe aim to use technology to close this gap. \"The FAIR extension\", is an open-source, web browser extension that allows users to make FAIR assessment directly at the web source. Web browser extensions have been an accessible digital tool for libraries supporting scholarship[2]. For example the reference managers deployed as a browser service[3].\n\nThe FAIR extension connects to a FAIR assessment API [4], i.e. we are not creating yet another FAIR assessment framework from scratch. The pop-up displays the FAIR metrics on the client side getting scores of articles, datasets and other DOs in real-time on a web source, such as a scholarly platform or DO repository. \n\n- References\n1.
