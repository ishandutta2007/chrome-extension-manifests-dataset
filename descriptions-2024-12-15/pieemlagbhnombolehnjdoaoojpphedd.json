Refined Prime Video allows you to hide them by blurring the thumbnails and hiding the descriptions of episodes you haven’t watched yet. You can control when that happens in the extension settings.\n\n★ Continue watching\nWanna quickly continue watching your favorite series without drowning in the sea of thumbnails of Prime Video’s home page or managing bookmarks? Just click on the Refined Prime Video icon, select the series from a list of things you’ve recently watched, and that’s it! The episode you left off at will start playing instantly.\n\n★ Skip shortcut\nSeeing a trailer for a new series while watching something else is super annoying and in the time that it takes for you to move your mouse to the “Skip” button and click, the trailer has already finished playing. With Refined Prime Video all you have to do is press the “S” key on your keyboard. This works with trailers, intros, recaps, and the “Next up” countdown.\n\n\nPrime Video is a trademark of Amazon Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc.
