The goal is to make your clicks \"tracking-free\".\n\nIt's simple:\n1. Right-click on the URL you wish \"Free\"\n2. \"frurl it\"\n3. The URL would open up in an Incognito window and devoid of any tracking\n\nFAQs:\n1. Does frurl track our clicks? Well, NO!\n2. What if it does not work for me for some of the URLs? This is highly possible given there are myriad ways to \"Track\" us on the web. Please send a note to the support email (frurlit@gmail.com) and we will take a look"
