Our goal is seamless compatibility across the web. We have tried to handle this situation at least for div, span or other non-input elements with the contenteditable attribute that contain the editable content, but we have not seen any improvement in operation. As a result, we decided to abandon this approach for cleaner code. It works in simple textareas and fields, like on Pastebin.com, Snippet.host, Removecomments.com, Text-compare.com, etc., but unfortunatelly it is NOT works in Gmail message writing field, Google Docs text editor, Facebook Messenger message field, Facebook post field, Confluence text editor, etc. You can feel free to use the Right Click Text Format icon in the browser's toolbar in any time on any website, which contains text field with all editing possibilites.\n- No built-in Undo: Like most extensions that programmatically modify content, the changes made by Right Click Text Format aren't tracked by the browser's native undo stack and it not worth the effort for this feature.\n- Fix punctuations: Resolving the more common typing anomalies in their own right takes priority over further optimization. This left unoptimized uses of \"...\" and the unnecessarily large number of punctuation marks (e.g. \"!!!\", \"??\").\n- Sentences to lines: Breaks sentences into lines based not simply on end-of-sentence punctuation, but on end-of-sentence punctuation and a letter following it. As a result, when there is a special character between two sentences, it does not break on a new line. This is so that sentences can also contain \"(?)\" or \"(!)\" parts.\n\nWe have accepted these issues. We accept didn't want to delay releasing a tool that can already boost productivity and eliminate tedious formatting work for so many users.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nNo data is collected. Changes are only made locally in the user's browser.\n\nJustifications for the requested permissions and usage:\n\nactiveTab permission:\nThis allows the extension to programmatically read and modify the content of web pages the user is actively viewing.
