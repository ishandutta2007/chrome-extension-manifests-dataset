With it's easy-to-use layout you can easily add and delete web pages to a list which is displayed inside the extension.\n\nAfter install you can just by a press of a button save the current tab to the list. You can also copy the URL of a web page you want to save, and paste it in the input field and save the input. When you are done with all the saved web pages, just press the delete button and the list will be cleared.\n\nTrackTheURL doesn't send user's data to any other part or store it in any database outside of your system, instead it uses the localStorage of Chrome to save the data to your own Chrome-browser.\n\nEnjoy!"
