Don't you hate it when a video is deleted or made private, and you don't even remember what it was? \n\nSync your playlists with Playlist Tracker, and get notified of any changes since the last sync. Notifications will include whether or not any videos have been added, deleted, renamed, or have changed from public to private (and vice versa). \n\nNotes:\n\n1. The \"Playlist ID\" is the part after \"list=\" in the URL of the playlist. For example, for \"youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsUMoyJKBqcn7dk3jC3i1023Ie-BntpgF\", the \"Playlist ID\" is \"PLsUMoyJKBqcn7dk3jC3i1023Ie-BntpgF\".\n\n2. Works only with public playlists for now. Playlists don't have to be your own, they just have to be public. \n\n3. You may have to re-add your playlists if you clear your browser's cache.\n \n4. If the extension starts behaving weirdly and you have to reset everything, click the clear-all icon on the top-right. \n\nFeedback welcome at protectyourplaylist@gmail.com\n\n______\n\nCHANGELOG\n\n______\n\nWhat's new in Version 4.3?\n\n1. Cleaner toolbar icon.\n\n2. Add hover text to the \"clear all\" icon based on user feedback.\n\n3. Code cleanup.\n\n______\n\nWhat's new in Version 4.2?\n\n1. Option to sync playlists automatically on Chrome startup.\n\n______\n\nWhat's new in Version 4.1?\n\n1. Can sync multiple playlists at once now.\n2. Notifications now have the playlist name in the title.\n\nShoutout to Grzegorz Ryznar for suggesting these! ðŸ™Œ\n\n______\n\nWhat's new in Version 4.0?\n\n1. (Housekeeping) Remove activeTab permission since it's not needed.\n\n______\n\nWhat's new in Version 3.0?\n\n1. Fixed invalid playlist ID bug - will no longer add a badly-formatted entry in case of an invalid playlist.\n\n2. Can specify either the playlist ID or the playlist URL now.\n\n3. (Housekeeping) Manifest version upgrade.\n\n______\n\nWhat's new in Version 2.0?\n\nMainly two things:\n\n1. Support for tracking a much higher number of songs.\n\n2. Separate notifications for songs added, deleted, renamed or made private. \n\n______"
