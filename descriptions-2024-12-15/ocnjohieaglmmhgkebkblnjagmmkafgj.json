Long comments will be cut off with an option to show the whole thing.\n\nExtra feature: Specify usernames you want to mute (case-sensitive). Their comments will be replaced by something fun*** so you won't be offended while reading the beanut gallery.\n\n***Take note that the definition of fun will be dependent on mary aka kdramalaws aka Song Jae Rim's #1 fan.\n\nUpdate March 14, 2015: Added custom spoiler tags. Now text enclosed in [SPOILER]your spoilery squeeing here[/SPOILER] will be displayed in very faint color. Hover the mouse over the spoiler to see it clearly.\n\nCompatibility: This extension works only on Google Chrome, desktop version of the Dramabeans website.\n\nDisclaimer: This extension is unofficial and was not sanctioned by the Dramabeans crew. Use of this extension means accepting that Song Jae Rim and mary is your OTP."
