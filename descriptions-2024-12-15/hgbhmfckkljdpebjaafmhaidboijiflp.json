Boost your productivity with focused 25-minute intervals, refreshing breaks, and alerts. Stay on track and achieve your goals, one Pomodoro at a time.\n\nThis Chrome extension helps you focus on any task you are working on, such as studying, cooking, writing, or coding.\n\nüçÖ What is Pomodoro Timer?\n\nA Pomodoro Timer is a tool inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, a popular time management method developed in the late 1980s. It works by breaking down your work into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, called pomodoros (named after the Italian word for \"tomato,\" inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer the technique's creator used). These intervals are interspersed with short breaks, usually 5 minutes long, to help you maintain focus and avoid burnout.\n\nHere's how the Pomodoro Technique works:\n\n- Choose a task: Decide on what you want to accomplish in a pomodoro session.\n- Set the timer: Start your Pomodoro Timer for 25 minutes.\n- Work on the task: Focus solely on the chosen task until the timer rings.\n- Take a break: When the timer finishes, take a short break (5 minutes). Stand up, stretch, walk around, or do something relaxing that doesn't involve screens.\n- Repeat: After your break, start another Pomodoro session for the same task or a new one.\n- Longer breaks: After completing four Pomodoro sessions, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).\n\nüöÄThe Pomodoro Technique is beneficial for several reasons:\n\n- Improves focus: By having shorter work intervals with breaks, you can prevent your mind from wandering and maintain better concentration.\n- Reduces procrastination: Knowing you only have 25 minutes to work on a task can make it less intimidating and encourage you to start.\n- Boosts productivity: By taking regular breaks, you refresh your mind and avoid burnout, leading to more productive work sessions.\n- Provides a sense of accomplishment: Completing Pomodoro sessions can give you a sense of progress and motivate you to keep working.\n\n\n*** Pomodoro ‚Ñ¢ and Pomodoro Technique ¬Æ are registered trademarks of Francesco Cirillo.
