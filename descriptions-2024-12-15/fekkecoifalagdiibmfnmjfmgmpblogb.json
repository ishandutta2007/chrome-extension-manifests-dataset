While this looks like a promising solution to the dying ads market, the implementation of webmasters is simply full out wrong as CoinHive itself has concluded.\n\nA webmaster following the instructions of CoinHive's documentation will by default end up consuming up to 70% of every visitor's CPU until they close the website. While this might not be a problem for desktops engergy-wise, it will drain the battery of laptops and smartphones. And we haven't even talked about the CPU usage slowing the machine down, fan noise, heat and a shorter hardware life.\n\nUntil a proper fix is released by CoinHive - for example requiring every visitor's consent before starting mining - I recommend manually adding a few block rules to your favorite ad blocker or installing this extension."
