To do this go to settings, choose the \"On Startup\" tab on the left, the choose \"Open a specific page or set of pages\". Add a new page for each page you would like to open when Chrome starts.\nThese are the websites that will be spread out across your screens as Chrome windows when Chrome first starts.\nNOTE: pressing the reload button in the extensions section will not make Tab Split trigger, it will only trigger when the browser is first opened, to test please close all your browser windows and reopen the browser.\n\nOPERATION\nWhen Chrome Browser opens it will cause each startup tab to move to a new window. Each window is moved to the next display.\nThis is useful for setting up automated monitoring in multi-headed environments.\nIt will trigger each time Chrome is opened. This allows you to keep the ability to open new tabs without them being moved to a new window when you open them if you need to open tabs temporarily. \n\nFEATURES\nThe extension now has the ability to choose between maximized screen and fullscreen, simply click the extension icon and choose which you would like and choose save. This will be your new default, change the option anytime you want.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\nThe extension opens windows horizontally and will not open in a vertical manner, meaning monitors must be setup in a horizontal fashion to display correctly. It will work with monitors of different sizes though. \n\nSUPPORT:\nFor best support please raise issues or questions on the Github page at https://github.com/Acetolyne/TabSplit/issues Chrome store will not send an email when you raise an issue or question on the Chrome Webstore so I may not see your issue or questions right away if you post there.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO:\nThe extension will open as many windows as you have tabs on startup. This setting is found under Chrome settings >> On Startup.\nChoose \"open specific pages when Chrome starts\" then specify the pages you want to open automatically when Chrome browser is started.\nFor typical dashboard setups you can then set Chrome to start with the computer, Chrome will open and the websites defined in the \"On Startup\"\nsection of the settings page will then be spread across your multiple monitors. \n\nTo change which screen the tab opens on, change the order of homepages on the Chrome settings page.\n\nIf you have more tabs set to open than you have screens then the extra tabs will open on the last monitor all in the same window.\n\nIf you use this extension I would appreciate if you would take a minute to leave a review on the Chrome Webstore so other users can have valid feedback."
