It automatically detects when you're applying for a job online (on select websites) and uses AI to extract key details like the job title, company, and location. When you submit an application, a small popup appears, allowing you to quickly review and save the information. By keeping all your job applications organized in one place, you'll never lose track of where you've applied or when to follow up. It's perfect for active job seekers who want to streamline their application process and maintain a clear overview of their job search progress, all while keeping your data private and secure on a database."
