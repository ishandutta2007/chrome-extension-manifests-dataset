If you want to participate and have ideas shoot them over here : \nhttps://github.com/Kunamatata/Starcraft2ChromeExtension\n\nFollowing your starcraft 2 stream has never been as easy.\nGet all the streamers of Starcraft 2 broadcasting in English or French! Add them to your favorite list and get notified when they get online!\n\nIncoming features: \nComplete Rewrite of the extension, to make it faster and to add lots of features such as, more languages, show your MMR etc, etc...\n===============\nChangelogs: \n\nv0.2.6: Add english back to the language broadcast list\n\nv0.2.5: Added support for new languages to select in the dropdown menu.\n\n\nv0.2.3: Added error message if server is done. Currently the OpenShift v2 server is down and in the progress of being fixed. That server stops on September 30th so I've been working on migrating to Openshift v3 or another server hosting service.\n\n\nv0.2.2: Fixed API calls that weren't valid towards the twitch api since their latest changes\n\nv0.2.1: Interface updated with transitions and clean animations. Changed API calls to a backend server which caches twitch results to have less load on the API. Let me know if there are bugs.\n\nv0.2.0 Notifications are now working (click star on stream to be notified when it goes online) and the extension is much faster than before.\nChangelogs : v0.1.2 New interface for the list of streams and incoming solid notification system.\n==============="
