This extension seeks to solve that by adding in a simple key binding for doing just that: Pinning and Unpinning tabs while browsing.\n\nThe default key binding is Ctrl + Shift + X (or Command + Shift + X on Mac OS X).\n\nThis extension requires no special permissions and doesn't inject anything into a page, the key binding is configurable from your extensions page so you can bind this to whatever you feel comfortable typing regularly.\n\nTo edit keybindings click the menu icon in the top left to open the sidebar and select \"Keyboard Shortcuts.\" Or, you can navigate to chrome://extensions/shortcuts with your address bar.\n\nOnce you've got it set up the way you want to get to pinning those tabs quickly and easily!\n\n---\n\nNovember 27, 2017 Note\n\nI've uploaded the source for this extension (extremely small) to Github. If you're interested to see what it takes to make this thing tick check out the \"tab_pinner.js\" file, if you want to make changes just make a PR with your proposed update. Enjoy!\n\nhttps://github.com/bbuck/tab-pinner\n\n---\n\nApril 30, 2015 Update!\n\nDue to another comment (I guess another will come shortly after I post this update) there is yet another new command now that allows you to PIN all tabs at once (in the current window). Now you can pin/unpin your current tab and Pin/Unpin all tabs of the current window! Hooray!\n\nI don't think I'll be willing to add anything more to keep things quite simple; however, if more suggestions do come in and they're not very complex or fit will with what is already done then I will most likely implement them when I can.\n\n---\n\nApril 24, 2015 Update!\n\nDue to comment request (even though it was just one, but I try and take care of you guys) I've added another keyboard shortcut for unpinning all pinned times at once. No other functionality was changed so feel free to use or ignore the new feature!"
