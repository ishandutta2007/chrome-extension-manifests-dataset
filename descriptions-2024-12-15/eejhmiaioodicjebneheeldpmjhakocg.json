Student ID Filler will automatically fill in your student ID on all Google Forms for you. Just enter your ID once when installing the extension, and never worry again :)\n\nNote: SIDF uses chrome's storage to store your ID meaning the data never leaves the safety and privacy of your computer.\n\n\n\nSIDF is an open source project, meaning you can see all of the code behind how this is implemented below, and make pull requests if you have suggestions on how to improve it.\n\nhttps://github.com/saarnav890/student-id-filler\n\n\n11/8/22 Update: Now shows ID when you click on the extension."
