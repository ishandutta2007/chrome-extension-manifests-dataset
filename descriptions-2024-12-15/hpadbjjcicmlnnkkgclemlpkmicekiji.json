Also, experimental display of the pronouncing details for languages with Latin letters is added. Let's look at the examples and then at the options.\nThe examples use Unicode combing characters and some computers can't show them. In Windows, Notepad and fonts like Lucida Unicode, Arial, Consolas can be used to view the text correctly.\n\nExample romanizations\nThe romanization can replace the native text. In options, this is called the default position. The romanization can also be shown above the native text. In options, this is called the position above.\n\nRussian\nRussian: пишет, училище, уже, не, отъезд, черный, солнце, Россия\niso9: dočʹ, pišet, učiliŝe, uže, ne, otʺezd, černyj, solnce, Rossiâ\nr9: dočʹ, pišet, učilišče, uže, ne, otʺezd, černyj, solnce, Rossija\nen: dochʹ, pishet, uchilishche, uzhe, ne, otʺezd, chernyy, solntse, Rossiya\npan: dočʸ, pʸišet, učilʸiśe, uže, nʸe, ot··ʸezd, černỳy, solnc̍e, Rossʸiʸa\n\nGreek\nGreek: Κλειδωνιά, Νίθαυρη, Λευκόγεια, Δοϊράνης, Χαϊδαρίου, Παύλου; αυε, αβε\npan: Kleidòniá, Níthav̀rì, Lef̀kógeia, Doïránìs, CHaïdaríou, Páv̀lou; av̀e, ave\nelot: Kleidonia, Nithavri, Lefkogeia, Doiranis, CHaidariou, Pavlou; ave, ave\n\nArabic\nArabic: اللغة العربية\nRomanized: āllghh ālʻrbīh\nThe Arabic script doesn't show most of vowels, so they're not shown in romanized text.\n\nChinese\nChinese: 他, 她, 它; 中文 \nRomanized: 他tā, 她tā, 它tā; 中文Zhōngwén\nChinese romanization (pinyin) adds Latin letters after every Chinese word. This way, it can be pronounced. The original Chinese text can be extracted from such a form. Showing also the Chinese characters help distinguish different characters with the same pinyin values.\n\nIn the position above, Chinese words are also translated. Romanization and translations are using CEDICT.\n\nExamples for detailed spellings\nThe orthography in a typical language that uses Latins script usually leaves out few details. The letters and their combinations don't always show the pronunciation. \nEnglish language uses a dictionary (CMUDICT) for most of the words, the other languages just show how the pronunciation can be marked.\n\nEnglish\nThe common marks in English detailed spelling are: /g/ can be as in gem (ĝém) or in get (gét), stress is marked with acute (áéíóúý, or as ȅȍȕ), traditional long vowels are marked (a>aʸ, e>è, i>ᴬi, o>oʷ) as in page (páʸĝe̤), rite (rᴬíte̤), home (hóʷme̤), theme (thȅme̤), cold (kóʷld). See list of words below for more examples.\n\nStandard: page rite home theme put cut sir, jet gem get cell sell call, what write right, round soul, cow own, touch; general generals, long longer, nation national, shepherd, record, getting, cold, called\n\nDetailed: páʸĝe̤ rᴬíte̤ hóʷme̤ thȅme̤ pút kȕt sị́r, jét ĝém gét çél sél kō̗l, wwa̰t rrᴬíte̤ rᴬítt, rȍund sóul, kȍw ówn, tȕch; ĝénrạl ĝénrạlz, lōng lō̗ŋgẹr, náʸšọn nášọnạl, shéph̤ẹrd, récord, géting, kóʷld, kō̗ld\n\nGerman\nThe German words are usually stressed at the first syllable and marked with acute (áéíóú) when not as in Kilometer (Kilométer). The letter /v/ is usually pronounced as /f/, but sometimes it stays /v/ as in Violine (Ṿiolíne). The letter /g/ is in some words pronounced like soft French /g/ as in Passagier (Passaĝíer). The /i/ in /ie/ is sometimes similar in pronunciation to letter /j/ as in Familie (Famílje). The letter /h/ after a vowel usually marks that the vowel is long and letter /h/ is not pronounced. When pronounced, it's separated with middle dot as in Alkohol (Alko·hol). The middle dot also marks separate syllables as in ideel (ide·el). \n\nStandard: Kilometer, Violine vier, Passagier, Familie, Alkohol Zahl, ideel Idee\n\nDetailed: Kilométer, Ṿiolíne vier, Passaĝíer, Famílje, Alko·hol Zahl, ide·él Idee\n\nItalian\nItalian uses open and close vowels /oe/. The open vowels are shown as /ɔɛ/. The stress in Italian is usually at the pre-last syllable. When it's not there, it's marked with acute as in celere (cɛ́lere). The letter /z/ can be voiced as in zero (ᴰzɛro) or voiceless (breᵀzza). Sometimes the sequence /gli/ doesn't represent a single word as in glicerina (g·licerina). The words with foreign spelling can be detailed like computer (compʸuter) or similar.\n\nStandard: celere celeste, però zero brezza, glicerina, computer Bucholz\n\nDetailed: cɛ́lere celɛste, perɔ̀ ᴰzɛro breᵀzza, g·licerina, compʸuter Bukholᵀz\n\nSlovene\nIn stressed syllables, there are 8 vowels phonemes in Slovene. In pan system, they're /aeɛəioɔu/. In detailed spelling, open /ɛɔ/ are shown as /êô/ and are always long. Detailed spelling additionally uses grave àèìòù for short stressed and acute áéíóú for long stressed vowels. Schwa /ə/ is not expressed in Slovene stress marking, but it was nevertheless used here. Initial /r/ occurs as in rdeč (ərdéč) or in unstressed /e/ before /lmnr/ as in moder (mṓdər).\n\nStandard: zelen moder rdeč, veja agent agenta pet petega, govor visok visoka, oče sestra, slovenščina Celje\n\nDetailed: zelén módər ərdèč, vêja agènt agênta pét pêtega, gôvor visòk visôka, ôče sêstra, slovénščina Cêlje\n\nPan-Latin spellings\nAs seen from the list of detailed spellings, different languages use different conventions for representing sounds and variations. For students of many languages, a more unified system can be more suitable. The “pan” series of conversion systems use mostly unified conventions that still allow fluent reading. \nAcute áéíóúɛ́ɔ́ always marks stress position. Open /eo/ and schwa /ə/ vowels are shown as in IPA. IPA sounds /tʃ, ʤ, ʃ, ʒ, t͡s, d͡z / are marked in only few ways, /ch č, ǰ ǧ ᴰž, sh š, zh ž, ts c̍ ᵀz, ᴰz/. Grave àèìòù and also on consonants marks language-specific alternate pronunciation. Macron āēīōū shows long vowel. Two dots below e̤ show deleted vowel as in English. Middle dot · shows that multi-letter sequence is not to have combined meaning. Phonetic raised letters ᵀᴰᴬʸʷ are used as parts of sounds or as additional sounds not shown in ordinary spelling.\nHere are few examples:\nItalian: celere celeste, però zero brezza, glicerina, computer Bucholz, seta visto polso autobus sbaglio casa cassa, greco greci greche saggio saggi liscio, questo, virtù città è e perché\nPan Italian: čɛ́lere čelɛste, perɔ́ ᴰzɛro breᵀzza, g·ličerina, kompʸuter Bukh̤olᵀz, seta visto polso autobus s̀balʸo kas̀a kassa, greko greči greke saǧǧo saǧǧi lišo, kwesto, virtú čittá ɛ́ e perké\nSlovene: zelen moder rdeč, veja agent agenta pet petega, govor visok visoka, oče sestra, slovenščina Celje\nPan Slovene: zelḗn mṓdər ərdéč, vej̍a agént agɛ́nta pḗt pɛ́tega, govor visók visɔ́ka, ɔ́če sɛ́stra, slovḗnščina C̍ɛ́lj̍e\nSimilar conventions are also used for English detailed system and different romanizations.\n\nOptions Page\nThe options page is divided into three sections with the horizontal lines. The active (clickable) texts are shown with gray background.\nThe upper section has three buttons for enabling, the list of abbreviations for the languages that can be romanized or detailed, and additional display button. The languages with the enabled romanization or details show the abbreviations in bold. The available languages are: \nThe button \"Enable All non-Latin\" enables romanization from all the languages that don't use the Latin script. It enables romanization of languages: Arabic (ar), Bulgarian (bg), Greek (el), Hindi (hi), Korean (ko), Macedonian (mk), Russian (ru), Serbian (sr), Ukrainian (uk), Chinese (zh). \nThe button \"Enable All Latin\" enables detailing for the languages that use the Latin script. It enables experimental detailed display of pronunciation of languages: German (de), English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), Italian (it), Polish (pl), Slovenian (sl).\nThe button \"Disable All\" disables any changes to the texts.\nClick to the language abbreviation shows the details of a language in the second section.\nIt's also possible to switch on “Showing romanization examples while selecting language”. This is used for an overview of changing. If this option is enabled, the following click to the language abbreviation shows example, if conversion is enabled and position is default.\n\nThe middle section shows the options for one language. It shows the following:\nConversion: either \"enabled\" or \"disabled\". Click to one of these two values changes the status.\nSystem: the list of romanization or detailing systems. Some languages only have one system, \"default\". The other languages have several systems. If the conversion for this language is enabled and position is default, click to the system name also shows example romanization. The system name in bold shows the current system.\nPosition of original and converted text. The default position is for most of the languages such that only the romanized text is displayed. For Chinese language, the romanized word follows the native word. The position \"above\" shows the converted words above the native words in pale-yellow background. In Chinese, the tool tip above each word shows the dictionary translation. The bold position name shows the current position.\nThe Native and Converted texts are shown for each language and conversion system. For most of the languages, it's possible to convert text back or forth by typing new text to the Converted box or to the Native box and the other box shows the corresponding text. There are few limitations, there is no conversion from Converted text written in English, Korean and Chinese. The button Clear removes all the text from both the example boxes. The button Unicode shows the Unicode character numbers for the native text.\nSome romanizations are not reversible. While all native texts can be romanized, it's not possible to produce all native texts from the romanized form using just character replacement rules. For example, Greek standard domestic (ELOT) romanization converts Κλειδωνιά to Kleidonia. When the latter word is converted back to Greek spelling, it becomes Κλειδονια. Stress marks are lost and distinctions between omega and omicron are lost, too. You can try another romanization that better preserves the original form.\n\nThe lower section excludes domains or computers from romanization. It can also set a language for romanization if the automatic determination fails. Finally, when a domain is excluded from romanization, a sub-domain can be included if listed above the parent domain.\nIf the domain list is empty, all web pages are romanized if they have the language defined. The language of a web page is taken from \"lang\" property of html document.\nTo exclude one or more web sites or domains, list them one in a line, then add a colon and minus “-”, for example:\nlocal:-\ngoogle.com:-\nmozilla.org:-\nstackoverflow.com:-\nchrome.com:-\nIf the “lang” property is not correctly defined and the page is to be romanized, add a language abbreviation after the colon:\nwww.weather.com.cn:zh\nTo include a sub-site while excluding the parent site, list first the sub-site, specify its language (if necessary) or mark inclusion with colon and plus “+”\nchina.chinadaily.com.cn:zh\nchinadaily.com.cn:-\n\nContext menu and extension tool\nThe Panlatin form is such that the original form can be produced from it. So, it may be different from some other romanization. The original form, to be sent to other program, is available from the menu.\nWhen the text was romanized with the default position, a part of it can be selected and the context menu has item \"Copy original text from Panlatin form\". Clicking it copies the native text to the clipboard. The native text is generated from the romanized Panlatin text, so it can differ from the original text if the romanization system is not reversible.\nTo have the original text in such a case, either select a reversible romanization system or select a the position above.\n\nThe extension tool (blue letter A and green Chinese character 字) has two buttons. The button Options is one way to start the option page.\nThe button Redo is useful if a web page was changed after the romanization was started, for example by some other script. The button Redo restarts the romanization."
