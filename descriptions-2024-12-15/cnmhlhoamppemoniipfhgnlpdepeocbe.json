This extension will let you know, showing a pie chart of your browser usage today, yesterday, last week, etc.\n\nIt works by tracking which browser tab is currently focused, or optionally, which tab(s) are visible (open and not minimized). It also will report time the browser is open but not focused. (Like if you're using another program altogether.)\n\nThis plugin *never* sends data anywhere. Everything stays local on your computer. You can inspect the source code here: https://github.com/djacobow/whttg\n\nVersions:\n0.0.1 -- initial release, proof of concept\n0.0.2 -- minor bugs\n0.0.3 -- output formatting\n0.0.4 -- column chart option\n0.0.5 -- icon, formatting\n0.0.6/7 -- change name for better SEO\n0.0.8 -- change name and remove references to a certain social media site after copyright take-down\n0.0.9 -- remove google charts and replace with chartjs because of Google charts' dynamic loading and use of eval()\n\n(*) -- That Social Media Site will remain unnamed because they took down an earlier version of this plugin for alleged trademark infringement."
