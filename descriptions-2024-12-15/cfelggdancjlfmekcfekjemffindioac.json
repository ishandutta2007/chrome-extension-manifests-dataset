Do you want Facebook to stop abusing your attention just to make more money? Is Facebook violating your privacy because they're too greedy?\n\nThen use this free video and image sponsored adblocker! It blocks image- and video-based sponsored posts and sponsored ads from showing up in your Facebook News Feed. This is where 90+% of their revenue comes from.\n\nDid you know Facebook is **actively sabotaging** video and image sponsored ad blockers? That's why half of the most popular sponsored ad blockers aren't effectively blocking Facebook sponsored posts or sponsored ads.\n\nThat's why this extension was created: so that Facebook video and image sponsored ads can once again be blocked easily!\n\nI personally tested these sponsored adblockers and NONE of them are working:\n\n* Ghostery\n* Adlock\n* Adblock for Facebook\n* uBlock Origin\n* Fair AdBlocker\n\nThe only ones I found to be working were:\n* Adguard\n* Adblock Plus\n* Total Adblock\n\nALL languages are now working.\n\nPlease contact me if this ad blocker is not blocking ads for Facebook used in your language.\n\n================================================\n\nWe are not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Facebook.\n\nFacebook is a registered trademark of the Facebook, Inc."
