The project usually has a login (username, id, email... and a password). That project will be promoted through different environments until production, so, for each of those previous environments, the users will be independent (probably, each env would have different databases).\n\nSometimes, you need to create specific users for specific scenarios: an user with locked account, an user with concrete role, an user with a huge set of accounts/movements/elements... and with that extension you can store all of them, and share them across your team and mates (even for QA testers).\n\nThe browser itself can remember you users and passwords; however, the different is when you have complex IDs (not a simple or easy email), and they are not very accessible to remember which characteristics has each of them. Besides that, thanks to that extension you can store additional details for each registered user. And, if you save the right query-selector, you could even inject the credentials with a couple of clicks using the contextual menu!"
