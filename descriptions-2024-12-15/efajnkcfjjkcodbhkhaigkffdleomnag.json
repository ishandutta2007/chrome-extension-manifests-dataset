Tired of storing 10+ variations of usernames and passwords in your brain (and forgetting them!!!)? So is everyone else! Today, the average person has 25 or more online accounts with associated usernames and passwords to remember, which most are keeping in an unsecure place. That’s where BeanLogin comes into play.\n \nBeanLogin’s chrome extension provides a seamless browsing experience to its users by automatically logging them into their favorite websites. The solution is pre-integrated with popular business as well as personal applications like Office 365, Google Apps, GoTo Meeting, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and many more. As you login to your favorite website, BeanLogin saves your credentials to a secure vault that only you can access. The chrome extension then lets you login automatically to your saved accounts, seamlessly across all your devices.\n \nFor more information on BeanLogin, visit our website at https://www.beanlogin.com"
