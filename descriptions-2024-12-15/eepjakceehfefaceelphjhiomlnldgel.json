It provides user information (number of tweets, followers, following and last activity) in list of users. In addition it provides highlighting users which will most likely re-follow us based on following/followers ratio and last activity. \n\nBest method to increase twitter followers is find big user profile dedicated to your line of interests (e.q. I am devloper for IT), open it's followers and follow them based on their bio and provided information, mostly following/followers ratio, because bigger the ratio, bigger chances for user to re-follow you.\n\nAny questions, suggestions please tweet @jCobbSK"
