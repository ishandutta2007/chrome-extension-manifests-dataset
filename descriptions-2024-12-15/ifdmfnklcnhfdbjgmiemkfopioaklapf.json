After reading the simple rules on GamesByEmail, you can try to conquer this Viktory II Komputer, then play versus up to 8 friends, on a real board or via free matches online, for the ultimate challenge. Here's some of what you can do:\n\nBuild your capital, towns, and cities on newly explored land - command infantry, artillery, cavalry, and frigates - connect supportive roads and ferries - get combat supply based on settled terrain - bombard from a distance or advance on the enemy - fight or retreat - defend the high ground and narrow lanes - cavalry charge over rough terrain - land amphibious invasions - siege towns to hinder supply - maneuver troops for attack vectors and use combined arms for stronger assaults. \n\nSpecial thanks to the GamesByEmail Viktory II author and to the original Viktory II board game inventor for their encouragement. As a single American hobbyist developer in Japan, I've tested this extension locally and do hope it works well - any mistakes are my own.\n\nTo use, just add to Chrome, and it'll be ready anytime the Preview tab is open. To add local players or fog of war, click \"New Game\" and select your options. To use in multiplayer across the web, in any active game, press the Extension (puzzle-shaped) Button next to the address bar and select the Viktory icon to add controls for a Komputer player.  \n\nUninstall, disable, or manage by going to chrome://extensions. The code can be quickly reviewed by right-clicking on the Viktory Preview page and then \"Inspect\" or via my GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/Stephen-Montague/ViktoryII-Komputer\n\nIf you'd like to code your own version, give ideas, or share war stories - please feel free to contact me (until this extension gets so extraordinarily popular that I can't keep up). See below on this page - Details - Developer Email - to drop me a note.\n\nMy free time for nearly a year was dedicated to build this and so help people to learn a beautifully made, relatively new board game - Viktory II. The original board game creator gave far more time and effort, though, and it's a cool story, which you can read here:\n\nhttps://www.viktorygame.com/viktoryiihistory\n\nOne of the coolest parts of the above story for me came when I read that Alan Emrich volunteered to rewrite the rules for clarity - this is the same guy who coined the term \"4x\" in the 90's for games like Masters of Orion and designs games even today. \n\nThe GamesByEmail website, now running for 2 decades, has cool backstories as well. The site has dozens of classic board games and clones, including for Risk, Diplomacy, and Axis & Allies - mostly done by one man. There's even a story (with video evidence) that he built a huge mechanical dice tower, with cameras and (I believe) convolutional neural net image recognition to capture \"real\" random dice rolls so the thousands of visitors who play on his site wouldn't complain about bad dice - or if they did - he could melt one down and mail it to them.\n\nAbout the AI - originally, I planned to create an opponent using the MCTS-PUCT algorithm, which I tested on GamesByEmail checkers; however, for now I've gone with a more traditional style Utility AI. Each turn, the Komputer may look at 1,000's of hand-crafted conditions to guess a good move and will often try different ideas.\n\nOn security - after install, Chrome gives a message that the extension can read and change data from GamesByEmail (which is true, to play the game) and read tab browsing data, which is also true -  only in that it waits for the correct GamesByEmail URL in the address bar, via the Chrome tabs API, and then loads this extension. \n\nHave a good one."
