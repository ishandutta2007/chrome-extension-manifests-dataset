But even after that, web pages can do network IO via JavaScript in background without the user knowing. This extension highlights such network activity and shows a count of requests done till now by the page in a small indicator. It's updated in real-time for each tab.\n\nA lot of web pages use background network requests for tracking user actions and sending data to remote servers, lazily loading heavy assets etc., and all that goes unnoticed by the user. Ideally, the browser's \"loading icon\" should spin for those requests as well.\n\nUploaded to my account by request of the author.
