TACKLES 🟢\n\nHas it happened to you that you start opening tabs in your browser and invariably, there comes a time when you have so many tabs opened in a single browser window, that everything becomes a hectic mess? Because…1. Each tab becomes extremely small, 2. It's hard to tell which tab is which, 3. It's aesthetically unpleasing, 4. it's a disorder, 5. It's confusing 6. On many occasions one has needed to forcefully close tabs or whole browser windows, losing important information; to be able to reduce the tab clutter and overload… and more.\n\n🟢 HOW DOES THE TABFLOW EXT. SOLVES THIS PROBLEM? 🟢\n\nWhen you have reached the tab limit that you have set for that specific window of your browser. What the TabFlow extension will do is that the next tab that you open, it will automatically be opened in a new browsing window. \n\nBy doing this, it enables you to avoid the tab overload headache of having too many\ntabs in the same internet window :).\n\n🔹🔸 FEATURES 🔸🔹\n\n🔹 WINDOW TRANSITION ARROWS:\n\n✅ The Transition Arrows work like a carousel, so you will eventually get to the browser window you are looking for.\n\n\n🔸 TAB LIMIT FOR THIS WINDOW:\n\nEach window has the number of tabs limit stated in the “Tab Limit for this Window”\nnumerical rectangle. The user can update the tab limit for that particular window and any other browser window that they have opened.\n\n✅ The user CAN INCREASE THE TAB LIMIT FOR A PARTICULAR WINDOW. As an\nexample, the user can change the tab limit of a window. From their current 8 tabs to a tab limit of 13 tabs.\n\n✅ The user CAN CHANGE TO A LOWER TAB LIMIT FOR ANY PARTICULAR\nWINDOW. As long as they close enough tabs, to the point where they have equal or\nfewer tabs opened in that window than the new lower limit that they want to set in that window.\n\nAn example of this would be… if you have 12 tabs as your tab limit, for that particular window. And you want to change that limit to be for 10 tabs. Then you have to close enough tabs to have 10 or fewer tabs opened in that specific window, if you want to proceed to make this reduced tab limit adjustment, for that internet window.\n\n🔹 SETTINGS:\n\n✅ FIRST WINDOW TAB LIMIT: You are setting your preferred tab limit for the first\nwindow when you open the first window of a new browsing batch.\n\nNote: The Tab Limit range is between 7 to 18 tabs for all browsing windows. The default number of tab limits for a browsing window that we think works well is eight (8) tabs, but you can change it, as you see fit and based on your preferences.\n\n🔸 MODE:\n\n✅ You can set the extension in either light or dark mode. The mode that you set, will become your predetermine, but you can change it at any time.\n\n🔹 SHARE:\n\n✅ We have an inbuilt sharing feature inside the TabFlow extension. So you can easily save your friends and everyone else. From the tab overload headache, in their internet windows!\n\n🔸 Available:\n\nCurrently the Tabflow extension is available in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge\nBrowser´s.\n--------\nThat was easy, now you know everything about this useful extension. Now you will be able to enjoy and be more productive within your browser by not having to deal\nanymore with your tabs overflowing and not flowing in your internet browser.\n\nIf you find the TabFlow extension useful, please consider telling others about it so they no longer have to deal with tab overload in their internet browser windows.\nBy the way, you rock!\n\n📪Comments/Questions/Collaboration/Get in Touch:<tabflowextension@gmail.com>"
