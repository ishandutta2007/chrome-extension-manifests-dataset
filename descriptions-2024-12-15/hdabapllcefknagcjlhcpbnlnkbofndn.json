It does this by syncing bookmarks inside a folder for each RSS feed.\n\nThis extension was previously called Foxish but was re-written to support Chrome Manifest v3. At this time it was simplified since Chrome no longer limits bookmark access like it did in the past and efforts were made to future proof it.\n\nSource code can be found at https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/Live-RSS-Bookmarks.\n\n⚠️ Bookmark syncing between multiple devices will cause duplicate folders and is not supported."
