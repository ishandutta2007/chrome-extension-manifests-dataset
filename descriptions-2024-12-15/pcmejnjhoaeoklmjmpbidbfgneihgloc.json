This helps you make better choices about what you watch.\n\nFor Everyone Who Wants to Focus: Whether you're studying, working, or just trying to learn something new, this extension helps you stay on track without getting lost in endless video suggestions.\n\nEasy to Use: Just add this extension to your Chrome browser, and you're all set. It's simple but very effective in helping you focus on YouTube. No registrations required \n\nThis extension helps you enjoy YouTube without getting sidetracked. It's like having a helpful friend who reminds you to stay focused, but also lets you decide when it's okay to relax and watch more."
