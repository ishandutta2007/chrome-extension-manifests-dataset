All of this without ever needing participants or any specific type of hardware.\n\nWe do so by using  a custom built AI that uses a Neural Net trained on tens of thousands of real eye-tracking studies. Our platform is able to predict, with an accuracy of approximately 95% compared to traditional eye-tracking based on the MIT saliency benchmark, how likely it is certain elements draw attention.\n\nThis allows you to:\n* See what your users would see when they first land on your page\n* Identify whether elements like logo, product, CTA draw attention\n* Validate your web design without A/B or other user testing\n* Optimize your landing page content and styling\n* Use the generated heatmap to identify what works... And what doesn't\n\nWant more?\nGenerated heatmaps are automatically added to a workspace in our web application, so if you need more insights simply head to our platform, log in and start using stuff like Areas Of Interest or our Reveal heatmap to get even more insights!\n\nNeed analysis of a full experience using video? \nNo worries, videos (including full user recordings) can be analyzed in our web application as part of our Pro plan.\n\nFor more information, head over to https://expoze.io.\n\nNeed support?\nhttps://support.expoze.io"
