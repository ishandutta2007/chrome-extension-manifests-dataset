It's a place where you can copy anything you feel is important or has any kind of value and grow it over time. It should be viewed as a companion to your browsing experience.\n\n\nOnce a page has been saved it can be viewed on the WebSatchel website under the “My Satchel” tab (Note: you must be logged in to see this tab and to save pages. Creating an account is free).\n\nThere is also a great emphasis on searching/organization. WebSatchel indexes every word on the saved webpage regardless if you save the whole page or just save the link. This makes searching for your saved pages really easy using our built-in search engine because you don't need to remember the title of a page - just any single relevant word or phrase would do.\n\nTags and keywords are used for more efficient organization once your satchel gets up to a few hundred pages. Also, since the link version still indexes every word on the saved webpage this makes it superior to regular bookmarking even though you are only saving the link since regular bookmarking doesn't index anything beyond the title of the page.\n\nApart from just allowing users to save pages WebSatchel also allows you to save the links to all your open tabs into a collection that can be opened back up at any time on any device. Even if only a link is saved, all the text is still indexed just like it would be if the entire page was saved. This is a significantly superior option to conventional bookmarking which does not index every word on the page and instead only indexes the page’s title at most. This makes searching for a particular saved link much easier.\n\nWebSatchel is also designed for users to save lots of web pages. Free users get 1 gigabyte of storage which is enough space to save hundreds of average webpages so don’t be shy about saving any webpage that might be of any use to you. Always better to be safe than sorry after all. Additionally, WebSatchel allows you to modify the pages that you save by highlighting the information that is most important to you. This makes finding the information even easier on the page that you save.\n\nAll saved pages are encrypted. The only person who can access your saved pages is YOU.\n\nWebSatchel is constantly improving and finding more ways to make saving pages an easier and smoother experience. New updates are scheduled in the coming months."
