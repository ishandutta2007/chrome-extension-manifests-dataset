Also the NWSL, and a range of Country teams as well. A few other sports such as rugby, tennis, basketball, cricket, etc also work. \n\nThere is a suggestion feature for any teams, clubs, sports, or countries that you think should be included.\n\nNeed to update the redirect for countries so that it only redirects if there are additional sports terms included in the search."
