Like a double-edged sword, it can simultaneously help you and hurt you.  It can help reconnect you with family and friends, but often addicts you to their minutia.  It can provide amusement for our more mundane moments, but often becomes distracting.  \n\nZenTab is an experiment in trying to control the torrent of the internet.  It does this by only allowing a single tab per window.  I'm not sure how effective this extension will be, but it's worth a look.    \n\nTry it out and tell me how well it works (also if you find bugs)... ManrajT@gmail.com"
