We provide tools to enable users to create their own network edits (nedits) which are shared to the entire community to improve everyone's browsing experience.\n\nUsers can select any of the previously created nedits through the Neditor popup. Additionally, one can also create their own by accessing our developer-tools extension (the Neditor popup contains an explanation on how to access it).\n\nUsers produce nedits not just for themselves but simultaneously for everyone else as the nedits are automatically shared to the Neditor community for immediate use.\n\nAdditionally users can opt to automatically utilize nedits by either the most popular or a recommended one. This allows a user to passively enjoy the benefit of nedits as you browse the web.\n\nBetter browsing with Neditor!"
