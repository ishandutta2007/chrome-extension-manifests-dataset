This free-to-use Chrome extension transforms the text of web pages by making the first half of every word bold, creating a unique visual cue that can help improve reading speed and comprehension.\n\nThis tool is beneficial for people with any form of neurodivergence where this kind of formatting can aid reading. Whether you struggle with dyslexia, ADHD, or any other condition that can make reading on a screen challenging, Bold Reader is here to help make your online reading experience better.\n\nKey Features:\n- One-click activation: Bold Reader works on any web page with a simple click.\n- User-friendly: Simple, clutter-free design makes it easy to use.\n- Secure: The extension only activates when you choose to use it and does not collect or store any personal data.\n\nThis extension is a completely free tool, developed with the sole aim of offering help to anyone who could benefit from it. There are no commercial interests attached to this project.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Install the Bold Reader extension.\n2. Navigate to any web page.\n3. Click on the Bold Reader icon to activate the extension and enhance the readability of the page.\n\nBold Reader is a product of an experiment to explore the ways artificial intelligence, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, can be used to contribute to making the web more accessible. The creation of Bold Reader involved coding advice and guidance from GPT-4 to an otherwise hapless amateur coder, but the extension itself operates independently without any AI components.\n\nInstall Bold Reader today and make your online reading experience better! I am very open to feedback and suggestions to improve the tool, so feel free to reach out."
