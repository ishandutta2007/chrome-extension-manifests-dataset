It has provided much assistance to me and I'm making it public even though it's very limited in functionality in hopes it may aid other people with this exact situation.\n\nI may extend it's functionality as I find other desired improvements or kill the  entire project once these sites enable more rigid filtering.\n\nFeel free to send pull requests or request new features. Who knows, maybe it's bugging me too! :-)"
