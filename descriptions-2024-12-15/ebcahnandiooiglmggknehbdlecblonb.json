Through the power of Gnosis IQ, teachers can identify students who need help in real-time.\n\nGnosis IQ brings awareness to educators regarding their students' academic health. Students may self-report in their Gnosis IQ journal as often as they prefer. Real-time Gnosis IQ notifications will attempt to alert staff members to the possibility of an at-risk student, or students."
