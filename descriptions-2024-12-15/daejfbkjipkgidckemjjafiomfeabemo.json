Debugger captures page-load and event-triggered requests for marketing and analytics tags and parses them into a human-readable format for easy tag or cookie debugging.\n\nObservePoint's Debugger is the first step towards comprehensive and efficient governance of your analytics, marketing tags, and cookies. ObservePoint’s full platform of web governance solutions can help you:\n🔅 Scan batches of pages or sequences of actions to verify accurate data collection\n🔅 Monitor your live implementation for errors in analytics tracking and variable formatting\n🔅 Test analytics in development and staging environments before releasing to production\n🔅 Simulate important customer journeys to test for obstacles in conversion paths\n🔅 Identify and locate cookies set by tags\n🔅 Receive notifications whenever your implementation fails expectations\n\n\nGet a free trial to see how ObservePoint can help you automate and scale analytics testing, privacy monitoring, and experience validation on your entire website: https://www.observepoint.com/free-trial/\n\n:: More Details About The ObservePoint Debugger ::\nDebugger is designed to help you debug analytics and marketing tags on a page-by-page basis. After installing the Debugger extension, you will see a new tab in your Chrome Developer Tools. Simply open this tab, refresh the page, and see which marketing and analytics tags and cookies are firing on your website.\n\nFor each tag, you will see the following information:\n🔅 Tag Name (e.g. Google Analytics 4, Adobe Analytics, Ensighten, OneTrust CMP Banner)\n🔅 Account (e.g. op-prod, G-299302931)\n🔅 Category (e.g. Analytics, Advertising, Social, Tag Management)\n🔅 Status (standard HTTP response codes)\n🔅 Request size/Response size\n🔅 Total Time/Latency\n🔅 Cookies Set by the \"set-cookies\" Header\n\n:: Basic Debugging ::\nClicking into each tag allows you to see the network request formatted as an easy-to-read list of variables and cookies set by the tag. You can also view the actual request in both its HTML-encoded and decoded formats.\n\nTo clear the log, simply click the “Clear Collected Data” button at the top right of the extension’s interface.\n\n:: Debugging On-Click Events and Cross-Domain Tracking ::\nBy default, Debugger retains the log of requests when navigating to a new page. By toggling the \"Preserve log\" option in the extension’s interface, users can make the log clear when moving from page to page. This may hinder troubleshooting on-click events and cross-domain tracking.\n\n:: Downloading Data ::\nUsers can download an Excel file of each tag by clicking on the “Export data” button at the top right of the interface. This data will appear in your Downloads folder as a file named OP_Debugger_Results_[CURRENT-DATE].xslx.\n\n:: Get Started ::\nDebugger is an excellent alternative for anyone who may currently use one or more of the following solutions: WASP, Charles, Fiddler, OmniBug, Adobe Debugger, or Tag Inspector.\n\nTo use this extension, follow these five easy steps:\n1. Ensure the extension is enabled by selecting More Tools from the Google Chromes’ ellipses menu, then selecting Extensions, and verifying the ObservePoint Debugger is enabled.\n2. Open the Chrome Developer Tools:\n--On Windows and Linux, press Control-Shift-I or F12.\n--On Mac, press Command-Option-I.\n3. Select the ObservePoint panel.\n4. Refresh the page you are on.\n5. Click on a tag to start debugging.\n\nBy installing this extension, you agree to the ObservePoint Terms of Service at http://www.observepoint.com/privacy-policy\n\nFor more information on the Debugger tool, visit: https://help.observepoint.com/en/articles/9113174-observepoint-tag-debugger-chrome-extension"
