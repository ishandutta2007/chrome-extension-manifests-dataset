Opens tab after tab and then has to spend hours finding that specific tab?\n\nIf that is the case, this extension is for you! With Butler James you can search through all your tabs and browser windows, quickly jump between them, and best of all - all of that can be done with just your keyboard.\n\nTo open the extension you simply press Command+Shift+Space (CTRL+Shift+Space). Then you immediately can begin to search for your requested tab. \n\nButler James comes with two modes. Search, and commands. With search you can search for your tabs, but with commands you can increase your productivity even further by saving urls for faster access, going to a specific webpage, or sharing the current page you're on. And all this with only your keyboard.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Increase your workflow today with arguably the best butler around! (even though it is named after a pretty clumsy butler)."
