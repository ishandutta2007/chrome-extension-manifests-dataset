It raises an alert when you visit one such site and gives you options to contact that brand, shop elsewhere, buy Trump-offset credits. You can always dismiss the alert and shop at the Trump-affiliated website without further interruptions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. Install the browser extension.\n2. Browse the internet as you normally would.\n3. If you visit a Trump-affiliated site, the browser extension will let you know.\n4. You take your money elsewhere!\n\nUmm... Privacy?\n\nWe take your privacy very seriously. This extension does not and will not ask for your name or email address. It observes your current tab to see to if the website belongs to a company on the boycott list."
