Create interactive demos in minutes that can be embedded on websites, blog posts, email, or tweets.\n\nHow? Just click ‘record’ and Arcade will automatically stitches together all actions (clicks, scrolls, etc), screen captures, videos, and tooltips. Add prompts to the hotspots (and change their color) to provide users with more context, and help push them further into product, and down funnel. \n\nArcade’s out-of-the-box Analytics help you quickly identify which parts of the product experience resonate most with your audience. Easily adjust demo flows to include new features, or based on what you discover in Analytics. Updates will automatically reflect in published Arcades.\n\nShare Arcade’s interactive demos throughout the customer journey — on your website, in emails, on social, blog posts and changelogs, and even in your application — to help drive interest, and ultimately make all users power users.  \n\nArcade makes it possible for you to lean into the Product-Led Growth movement by showcasing your product right where your customers expect.\n\nArcade is for marketers, product managers, sales reps, developers, customer support/success managers, or anyone who wants to show, not tell."
