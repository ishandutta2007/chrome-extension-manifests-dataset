To show the distraction, you simply click the button.\n\nWhat you hide is completely up to you. For every distraction Nudge hides, you have two options:\n\n★ Hide the distraction at all?\n\n★ If hiding, show the button to unhide?\n\nNudge comes with 14 hidden distractions across 7 sites including X, Facebook, TikTok, Bluesky and YouTube, and we’re rapidly adding to the list.\n\n**Request new sites by emailing [feedback@nudgeware.io](mailto:feedback@nudgeware.io)**\n\nNudge puts you in the driver's seat so that distractions aren't pushed on you by default.
