The web application I am currently using for work, which involves training LLM generative AIs, also has limited editing capabilities and is difficult to use. Additionally, it lacks a dark mode, causing eye strain.\n\nFurthermore, likely due to concerns about users pasting raw output from chatbots that may contain hallucinations and logical inconsistencies, this web application penalizes pasting altogether. As a result, work takes unnecessarily longer, benefiting no oneâ€”not the clients, the administrators, or the workers. It's a completely counterproductive approach.\n\nI have reported this issue, but have received no responses for weeks. Therefore, to escape this frustrating situation, at least for myself, I decided to create a Chrome extension that uses DOM manipulation to 'insert' clipboard contents into input fields, instead of pasting.\n\nThis method is similar to what Grammarly does, so it should not be penalized by the input tool."
