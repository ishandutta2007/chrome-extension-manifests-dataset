On Wikipedia it's quite easy to suddenly realize you're studying some esoteric subfield that's probably not even worth reading about if you're not an expert. This extension is like a barometer that tells you how far down the rabbit hole you've gone, and at what point you should probably resurface. Plus, it's just kind of fun to see how popular a page is compared to others.\n\nThe popularity is measured by comparing the approximate number of page views for an article over the past 30 days to that of the 10th most popular article. The meter also has mouseover text which tells you additional information about the article's view statistics.\n\nIt supports all languages.\n\nThe storage permission is used so that the extension doesn't have to fetch page statistics as frequently, but can instead cache them for a while.\n\nI used a square root scale to represent the great variation in page views between pages in a way that feels natural.\n\nYou can also find the source code here:\nhttps://github.com/KDJDEV/wikipediaPagePopularityMeter\n\nThis extension is also available on Firefox Addons here:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wikipedia-popularity-meter/"
