Then, you can download them in a CSV file. \n\nFor each lead, you can also search for his/her email address, through Icypeas email enrichment engine. This step is optional. \n\n/// How Does It Work? ///\n\nAfter this extension is installed, go to your Sales Navigator account and search for leads. You will see a big green button \"Extract with Icypeas\". \n\nThis Chrome extension will retrieve your Linkedin session cookie, allowing Icypeas to scrape the lead search automatically in the cloud. While the scraping occurs, you are free to close your Chrome tab. \n\nOnce the scraping is completed, you will receive an email notification with a download link. You can also see and download your leads from the Icypeas webapp. \n\n/// Is It Safe? ///\n\nTo protect your Linkedin account from getting restricted, Icypeas puts a daily quota. Depending on your Icypeas plan, this quota is:\n* Free plan: 1000 leads per day\n* Basic plan: 2500 leads per day\n* Premium plan: 5000 leads per day\n* Advanced plan: 7500 leads per day\n* Hypergrowth plan: 10,000 leads per day. \n\nTo avoid exceeding these limits, we strongly advise you not to use multiple scraping tools on the same LinkedIn account. Also, we advise you not to use Icypeas or any other scraping tool with newly created Linkedin accounts. Your Linkedin account must be older than 3 weeks and have regular organic activity. If you want to know more about Linkedin warmup tips, check our blog or Youtube channel. \n\n/// Can I Use This Extension With A Free Linkedin Account? /// \n\nNo. This extension works with Sales Navigator only. (If you are serious about sales, we encourage you to consider the purchase of a Sales Navigator license. More about that here: https://www.icypeas.com/blog/linkedin-premium-prices-and-benefits-2024-edition)\n\n/// Can I Close My Chrome Tab While Scraping Is In Progress? /// \n\nYes. Once you have launched your extraction, you can close your tab or even your computer. The scraping is operated in the cloud, on Icypeas' servers."
