Turn your reasoning into an explicit chat.\n\nUnlike rigid scheduling tools, Taskfulness understands that you receive dozens of new requests and ideas every minute. Which should you work on? Let the extension validate them and tell you. Using critical thinking methods, it prompts you with relevant and specific questions before you rush into performing any task.\n\nHere are some Taskfulness features:\n\n- THINK chat: an interactive task validation tool\n- START chat: a quick task tracking feature\n- DAY OVERVIEW: a journal of activities finished “As Planned” and “Not as Planned,” including the reasoning and assumptions behind them\n- TIMER with audio notifications\n- CURRENT activity reminder\n\nTaskfulness - your attention log :)"
