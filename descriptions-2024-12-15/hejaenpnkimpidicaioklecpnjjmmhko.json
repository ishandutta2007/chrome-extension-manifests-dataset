Product Managers, Developers, and QA teams will also benefit from its power to customize any tag network request.\n\n- For Adobe, it will detect your Adobe Launch Property environments so that, while in production, you can switch them for testing new tag management changes on your website. It does it for Adobe DTM too. Now you can switch from DTM to Launch as well.\n- For Google, it will detect your Google Tag Manager embed and flag common implementation issues. \n- For Tealium, it will detect your property and let you switch between Dev, QA, or Prod\n\nThe real magic, however, begins when you can switch any tag network request for anything. With Switchboard you can now troubleshoot, debug, and implement any tag with surgical finesse. \n\nRead all the features and release notes here: https://bitbucket.org/tagmanagerextension/switchboard-release-notes/src/master/ \n\nIt does this all within a beautiful UI split between two tabs:\n\nThe Active tab detects what tag manager is implemented on the site, shows you the embed code and, depending on the TMS implemented, will let you seamlessly switch between Production and Development environments. \n\nThe Custom tab gives you the power and flexibility to manually switch any part of any individual tag laser-targeted focus.\n\nIn its current version, the Active tab supports Adobe Launch, Adobe DTM, Google Tag Manager, and Tealium use cases. We are working tirelessly to also support other tag managers such as Ensighten. Beyond switching environments, we have incredible tag management implementation features planned."
