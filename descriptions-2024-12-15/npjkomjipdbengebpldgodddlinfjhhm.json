So if for any reason it seems to be taking too long, that means it's stuck and you should try again a little bit later.\n\n** This is very unlikely, however, In some cases we may not be able to detect the Shopify theme being used on a Shopify website. If you encounter such a case, we would appreciate it if you could let us know about this so we can make sure the extension is up to date and works the best possible.\n\n==================================\n\nThis extension is part of the Shopify Theme Detector website where you can detect the Shopify theme used on a Shopify website and get even more interesting information about the website you are interested in.\n\nOn the website you can also get a whole lot of information about Shopify, such as the best Shopify themes for specific types of shops, best Shopify apps for whatever you need done on your site, hundreds of FAQs that we answer for you, so you can spend all your time building your brand instead of searching for informations online.\n\nFor any questions about the extension or anything else, we would be happy to help you out. Just send us a message from our website and we will get back to you."
