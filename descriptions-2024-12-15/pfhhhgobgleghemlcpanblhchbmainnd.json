However, many other pages have their own stylesheets which makes some other pages look off. If you would like to help fix some of these problems, or would like to report some other problems, please join the discord!\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/QW3zypg\n\nWhats New???\n\nUpdate 1.0\n\nMASSIVE UPDATE!!!\nI worked with the VT IT department to restyle the entirety of Hokie Spa. Unfortunatly, after working on the code for a while, they decided to not use my janky code (very understandable) and are pursuing another way of modernizing the website. But, this means I have a bunch more code to add onto the chrome extension!\n\nUpdate 1.1:\n\nBugfix!\nTabs are now clickable on the whole tab"
