It can increase your productivity, help you study more effectively and is a must have if you are learning a new language.\n\nSlang shows the text in the pop-up synchronized with the speech, so that you can read along, regardless of the page you're on. Listening and reading simultaneously increases comprehension, strengthens memory, helps build fluency skills including proper phrasing and expression and improve sight word recognition!\n\nIf you want to save time or keep your eyes off the screen, let Slang read the contents of a web page for you.\n\nIt is very simple to use, just select the text you want to hear, open the pop-up and click on the play button or right click on the selected text and click on speak. You can also type or paste in the pop-up whatever you want to be spoken. You can change the volume, rate, pitch and voice.\n\nSupports 14 languages, some in different accents, totaling 21 different voices.\n\nAccess the project's github page to give feedback, report bugs and access the source code:\nhttps://github.com/kauer3/Slang-Text-to-Speech"
