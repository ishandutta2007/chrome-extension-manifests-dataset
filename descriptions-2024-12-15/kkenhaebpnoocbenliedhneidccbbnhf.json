You can still click the \"Play All\" button to play the list as a whole.\n\n---\n\nHistory:\n\nv0.2: The single play behaviour can be configured for all playlists or for watch lists only.\n\nv0.1: Initial release, works only for the watch list.\n\n---\n\nKnown problems:\n\nIf you have the watch later list already playing in one tab and, in another tab, open a single video from the watch later list YouTube somehow makes an additional redirect and you get two entries in the browser history.\n\n---\n\nRequired Permissions:\n\n\"storage\" to save the options mode to chrome\n\n\"tabs\" to verify that a request comes from the watch later list\n\n\"webRequest\", \"webRequestBlocking\" to redirect the request to the correct player\n\n\"*://www.youtube.com/\" to access YouTube"
