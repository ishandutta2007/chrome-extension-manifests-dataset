Another thing I like is using national days in my greeting - \"Happy National Chocolate Fudge Day!\" or \"Happy Cinco De Mayo\"\n\nThe problem I had is that I send between 50 and 100 emails a day and typing that out at the end of each mail is just a lot of work...\n\nThat is why we created \"Happy Appi\" - it is a Chrome extension that works together with nationaldaydirectory.com to dynamically insert any days that you support in your email greeting on the day. You can choose what you want the greeting to say on days when you have no national day selected. \n\nFor Instance - I use the national days in my greetings with the day of the week as fallback. I am also able to set a signature in Happy Appi if I do not want to use the standard Gmail Signature.\n\nWhile I was at it I also added the ability to insert dynamic quotes at the bottom of each email (Below the Signature). Should you want to include different quotes on your email signature you select all the quotes you like and the extension will randomly insert one at the bottom of each email.\n\nHappi Appi is designed to make emails happier and more interactive;-)"
