To use it you must be a breast cancer patient in Norway, Sweden, or Spain so that the doctor that treats you can enroll you in the program and provide you with login credentials. The plugin monitors your online activity and collects prospective data. More specifically, the plugin collects titles and URLs of websites visited and search queries. The collected data are used to develop analysis tools that will estimate the emotional and cognitive state of the breast cancer patient. Then the doctor can receive notifications when the tool detects deterioration of emotional well-being in order to intervene faster and more accurately, providing better post-cancer treatment and support to the patient."
