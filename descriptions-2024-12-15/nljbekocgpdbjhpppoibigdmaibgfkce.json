This allows you to automatically loop a segment without having to rewatch the screen each time, which is useful when you want to repeat songs or video segments at a specific moment without the need to manually locate the content. Additionally, you can always see when a loop is active through its green indicator. \n\nNote: If the loop occasionally becomes stuck, simply refreshing the browser resolves the issue."
