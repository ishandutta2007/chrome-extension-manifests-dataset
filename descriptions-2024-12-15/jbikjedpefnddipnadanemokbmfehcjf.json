Grand aspirations of Slormux: giggles and world peace.\n\nIn the depths of my mommy and daddies basement my friends and I screwed around.  One of us had a york peppermint patty, then another one of us pointed, and screamed \"YORKIES!\".  Thus, Slormux was born.  The ideology of Slormux is to speak in a way that sounds dumb as hell and to make random word substitutions that hardly make sense.  For instance, if you were to ask a girl on a date, you could say:\n\n\"Hey grilsies, you wanna grab some grubblorz with me ploxles?\"  to which she might respond: \"Ay! Swagies! Plorbleplorbs!\"\n\nSlormux, at its very nature, is de-escalational.  I don't think I've EVER had a fight with anyone after I said \"plix bb!\"  If a fight begins, simply start speaking in Slormux.\n\nSlormux is about breaking free of language constructs.  It's about letting your inner dummy fly.  \n\nBut most of all, Slormux is about freedom.\n\nGo forth and unleash your inner beast in a beautiful explosion of unbounded swag.\n\nPlox!"
