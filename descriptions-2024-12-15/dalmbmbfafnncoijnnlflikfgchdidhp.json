This is an example of how Codeforces may look like without an incorrect use of flags. Please reach out to Codeforces admins and ask them to fix that language picker.\n\nWhy? Because flags represent countries, not languages!\n\nFlag may mean different things like country, citizenship, currency, location, etc, when a language is a means of communication. There is no one-to-one connection between languages and flags, because one country is not necessarily one language, and one language doesn't belong to one country only. Flag also may carry political agenda, tolerable in some societies, but unacceptable in others.\n\nUsing flags as language indicators is discouraged by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is considered to be a bad practice. More details on the suggestion not to use flags as language indicators can be found at World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Working Group Note 03 June 2014, see https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang."
