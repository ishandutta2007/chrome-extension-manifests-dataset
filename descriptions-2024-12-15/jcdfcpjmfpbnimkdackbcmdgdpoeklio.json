This works only in the hacker news website, and is it acts on the current batch of items being displayed.\n\nThe ycombinator's hacker news website is a mess in terms of semantic html, so please feel free to report any bugs to help me improve this extension.\n\nPS. If you have other Hacker News extensions installed that change in anyway the html of the page, this extension won't work!\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- If you open a link with right-click -> \"open link in new tab\" the item doesn't get marked as read. Use middle click instead (Cmd+click on mac) - Currently working on this."
