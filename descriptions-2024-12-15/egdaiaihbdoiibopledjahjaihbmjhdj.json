For instance, it helps Digital Brand Managers, Digital Content Managers, and Semantic Search Engine Optimization (SSEO) practitioners understand what may or may not be affecting Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) placements.\n\nHow is it used? \n\nSimply install the extension to your browser and then visit a page of interest. On page arrival, the OSDS icon will be visually activated thereby indicating metadata discovery; once the icon is clicked, you will be presented with a presentation of transformed metadata."
