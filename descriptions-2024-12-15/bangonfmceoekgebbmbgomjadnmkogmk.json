When you hover over any of the certifications, you'll see a quick breakdown of what that certification means.\n\nYou'll also be able to see what certifications a company has when viewing their website.\n\nFurther, when shopping on Amazon, if you view a product without environmental certifications, we try and find more sustainable options for you.\n\nAll of these features are quickly expanding to include more products, companies, and retailers."
