This method can be unreliable as well as quite unsafe. If the layout of the Gmail inbox changes for some reason, these adblockers could either stop working or remove important content from the inbox and you could for instance miss out on important emails.\n\nThis Gmail AdBlocker extension does not mess with any content on your Gmail inbox page. It simply prevents the page from fetching the ad-related content giving you a safe, reliable and seamless ad-free experience with your Gmail inbox. The extension is ultra-lightweight and does not consume any significant memory or processing power. \n\nUsing the extension is as simple as just installing the extension and viola! you won't see ads in your Gmail inbox anymore!\n\nFeatures of Gmail AdBlocker\n==========================\n* Safe and reliable (never messes with the content in your inbox)\n* Ultra-lightweight and fast\n* Simple and easy to use"
