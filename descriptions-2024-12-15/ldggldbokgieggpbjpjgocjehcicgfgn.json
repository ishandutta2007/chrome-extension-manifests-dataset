This fixes issues caused by this change. 20/06/2017\n\nVersion 2.13 - Updated URL's used in Daily, Weekly and Monthly reports due to change in structure in last BP release (4.90)\n\nversion 2.12 - Minor fix to account for Brightpearl version having two digits for minor releases - (e.g. 4.79.12)\n\nVersion 2.10 - Minor release. Bug fix\n\nVersion 2.0 Release:  Please see the Options section for a full explanation of new functionality.\n\nNOTE: You must set your date format (DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY) for the extension to work properly.\n\nThe aim of this extension is to help prevent human error and speed up some processes.\n\nThe extended list of options can be individually activated or deactivated.\n\nEach option has an explanation of current functionality and what activating the option will do.   \n\nFeedback and suggestions are welcome!\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nOlder Version Release Notes\nRelease Notes:04/01/2012 - Made sure dates have a leading zero as this causes an error when receiving supplier invoices\n\nRelease Notes:06/12/2012 - Fixed a bug stopping settings being stored\n\nThis Brightpeal Extension creates some minor functionality changes.\nFirst, it adds three ugly looking buttons to the controls area on the left-hand side. \nThese buttons link to the sales section and filter automatically to show current performance (this calendar month, this week and today).\n\nSecondly, it adds additional payment options for receiving invoices from suppliers (configurable for each user) \n\nThirdly, it updates the way that invoices are received from suppliers - setting the invoice date to today and default for updating pricelists to false\n\nI also added in a 'Fast Search' - this lets you enter an order number in the search box and go directly to that page.\n\nSee the options page for more information\n\nThese basic changes may impact on performance"
