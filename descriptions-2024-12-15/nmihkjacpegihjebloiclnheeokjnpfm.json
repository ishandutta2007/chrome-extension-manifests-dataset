This Chrome extension allows you to share any open tab with your team and they will be able to interact with the website. It's like screen sharing with interactivity.\n\nTo use this feature, be sure to create a Duckly account and be part of a team. \nJoin a video call by going to your team URL on Duckly and you'll be able to share any open tab.\n\nOther things you can do with Duckly:\n- You can share your code in real-time directly from your IDE and independently of what IDE your colleague is using.\n- You can also share your terminal session.\n\nWe care deeply about your privacy and security.\n\nThe website is only shared P2P encrypted with the call participants. No data touches our servers.\n\nIf you are on a call with up to 4 participants, your voice and video are also only shared P2P. For calls with more than 4 participants, we use a cloud infrastructure in order to maintain the call quality."
