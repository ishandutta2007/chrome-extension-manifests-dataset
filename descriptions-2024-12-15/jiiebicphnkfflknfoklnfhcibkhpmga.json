It enables users to view the spreadsheet and the content of the URL in a side-by-side arrangement, facilitating seamless and rapid review of both the spreadsheet data and the linked web content.\n\nThis feature is particularly useful for efficiently comparing details of digitized invoices and receipts (processed through OCR or AI) against their original files.\n\nKey Features:\n\nRegular Expression-Based Filtering: This extension allows for the automatic opening of links only if the URL in a given cell, or the cell range/name, matches a specified regular expression pattern. This capability effectively prevents the opening of irrelevant links.\n\nPrivacy:\n\nThis extension does not send or store any information to external services.\n\n\n\nSample data for screenshots was sourced from https://expressexpense.com/blog/free-receipt-images-ocr-machine-learning-dataset/"
