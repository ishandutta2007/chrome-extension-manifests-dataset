This tool makes it much easier to introduce people. Think about the headache of leaving your email, going to LinkedIn, searching for a connection, grabbing the URL, then inserting it into Gmail and typing out the name. This extension does that for you.  \n\nInside Gmail, type the equals button, =. This pops up a LinkedIn search bar. Type the name you are looking for and click on that connection. This pulls in the connection's url to LinkedIn. \n\nIf you need the equals sign, simply press the esc button or X out of the search. \n\nWhen first installing the extension, make sure to reload your Gmail page for the extension to work. \n\nWorking on multiple chrome profiles? Simply download the extension for each profile and login to LinkedIn in your browser. You will be automatically signed in to your account. \n\nRemember, Type =, then the search box will pop up. Press ESC or X out of the search to keep the = sign."
