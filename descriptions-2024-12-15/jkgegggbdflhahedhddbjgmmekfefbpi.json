Create HTTP requests to access custom-made Node-Red events, and have them accessible through an integral Chrome popup!\n\nPermissions: the extensions asks for access to all websites because I cannot know in advance what is the address of your Yamaha receiver or Homeassistant installation. The extension NEVER connects to the external internet.\n\n-- Questions? Ideas? Bugs? Please LMK!"
