Or maybe you don't talk enough? Wouldn't it be nice to know when you are dominating the conversation or failed to comment at all?\n\n\"Am I Talking A Lot?\" provides the solution by keeping a private record of participant talking time in Google Meet meetings.\n\nUser testimonials\n- \"I need that extension, lol!\"\n- \"This extension is great because it provides a subtle reminder to wrap up my thought and let others speak.\"\n- \"I especially enjoy the minimize button so I can toggle seeing the data or not.\""
