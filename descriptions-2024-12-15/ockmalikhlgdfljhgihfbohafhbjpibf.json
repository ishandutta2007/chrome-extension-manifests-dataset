Items unavailable in your country will also be sorted to the bottom of the list, as these would tend to appear cheaper due to the shipping cost not being tabulated.\n\nThis extension is also compatible with scripts that allow infinite loading, such as Discogs Enhancer and AutoPagerize.\n\nNote that this extension sorts all listings currently loaded on the page, but does not automatically pull in prices from any further results pages. Therefore, it's recommended to set Discogs to view 250 listings at a time to incorporate more results."
