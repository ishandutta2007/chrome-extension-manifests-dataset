Spotting that lonely nofollow rel attribute in hundreds or even thousands of links is really some time-consuming task that no SEO expert should be bothered by for too long.\n\nNautilink helps you speed things up a bunch by giving you a complete overview of each webpage's anchor tags. In particular, this overview automatically detects:\n\n✓ Follow and NoFollow rel attributes;\n✓ Any other rel attribute value (as in \"sponsered\", \"noopener\", \"noreferrer\" and many more);\n✓ Internal and External links.\n\nOnce the overview has loaded you can either:\n\n✓ Highlight each single anchor tag in order to make it easy to spot it in the webpage (BEWARE: anchor tags could be listed in the DOM but could not be visibile in the UI. This means that some anchor tags may not be highlighted at all);\n✓ Export the data in a handy csv file for further analysis.\n\nSave some of your SEO expert time and just start diving with Nautilink.\n\nIf assistance were needed you can contact us at:\nEmail: alessandro.pedrocco.dev@gmail.com\n\nWe also greatly appreciate any feedback!\n\nHappy analyzing,\n\nThe Nautilink contributors.\n\n[AUTHORIZATIONS: This extension needs to access the download folder in order to save the csv file. Nautilink aims to be as transparent as possible and does not store any information.]"
