Living Off Trusted Sites (LOTS) Project: The LOTS Project is a research project that aims to understand the threat landscape of the web. The project maintains a list of suspicious domains that are often used by attackers to host malicious content. https://lots-project.com/\n\n2. FileSec: FileSec is a project that aims to provide information about file extensions and their associated risks. The project maintains a list of file extensions that are commonly used by attackers to distribute malware. https://filesec.io/\n\nLicense Apache License 2.0. See the LICENSE file for details. (You'll need to specify the license in the store listing separately, not within this description.)\n\n\n\nFAQs for Safe Browsing Guard\n\n1. Why does Safe Browsing Guard flag legitimate websites like file-sharing or cloud storage services?\n>> While these platforms are legitimate, they can be misused by attackers to host or distribute malicious files. Safe Browsing Guard adds a layer of protection by scrutinizing downloads and activities, even on trusted sites, to help keep you safe.\n\n2. If these sites are commonly used and trusted, why isn't my antivirus or firewall blocking them?\n>> Antivirus and firewalls primarily focus on known malicious files and websites. They often trust popular platforms, which is precisely what makes these platforms attractive targets for attackers. Safe Browsing Guard complements your existing security by looking for suspicious behaviors and patterns, regardless of the website's general reputation.\n\n3. The extension frequently alerts me. It's disruptive. Can I customize the alerts?\n>> Absolutely! You can configure Safe Browsing Guard's alert frequency in the options. Choose to be alerted always, once per day per domain, once per week per domain, or never. Even with alerts off, the extension icon will change to indicate potential threats, allowing you to stay informed without constant notifications.\n\n4. I'm a security professional and understand online risks. Do I need this extension?\n>> For experienced users, the alerts might seem redundant. However, Safe Browsing Guard can still offer a valuable \"second opinion,\" especially for detecting potentially compromised accounts or malicious activity on trusted platforms. The customizable alert settings and icon-based warnings allow you to tailor the extension to your expertise. (Removed \"file extensions\" – seemed out of place.)\n\n5. Safe Browsing Guard flagged a download from a site I trust. What should I do?\n>> Proceed with caution! While the site itself might be legitimate, the downloaded file could still be malicious. Use a reputable online virus scanner (like VirusTotal from extension options) to check the file before opening it.\n\n6. Can I completely disable Safe Browsing Guard for specific websites?\n>> Yes, you can add websites to your \"Trusted Domains\" list in the extension's options. However, we strongly discourage this unless you absolutely trust the site and all its content. It's generally safer to reduce the alert frequency to \"once a day\" or \"once a week\" instead of completely disabling protection.\n\n7. Safe Browsing Guard flagged a download from a site I trust. What should I do?\n>> Proceed with caution! While the site might be legitimate, the download could be malicious. Scan it with a reputable online virus scanner like VirusTotal (accessible from the extension's options or at virustotal.com) before opening. (Clarified VirusTotal access.)\n\n8. How does Safe Browsing Guard identify suspicious websites and downloads?\n>> It uses an internal database of known suspicious domains and file extensions, combined with URL analysis and other heuristics. This data is regularly updated to stay current with evolving threats.\n\n9. How often is the suspicious domain/extension data updated?\n>> We strive to update our data regularly. Check for extension updates or visit our GitHub repository (https://github.com/lmotwani/safe-browsing-guard-chrome) for the latest information. (Simplified wording, included direct GitHub link.)\n\n10. Does Safe Browsing Guard collect my browsing data or personal information?\n>> Absolutely not. Safe Browsing Guard is designed with privacy in mind. It does not collect or transmit your browsing history, personal data, or any other information. All analysis is performed locally on your computer.\n\n11. I have a question not covered here. Where can I get help?\n>> Visit the extension's GitHub repo page (https://github.com/lmotwani/safe-browsing-guard-chrome) or contact us directly through the email address provided on the support page.\n\n12. I found a bug or have a suggestion for improvement. Where should I report it?\n>> We appreciate your feedback! Please report bugs or suggest improvements on our GitHub page (https://github.com/lmotwani/safe-browsing-guard-chrome). Your contributions help make Safe Browsing Guard even better.\n\n13. Is Safe Browsing Guard open source?\n>> Yes! The source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/lmotwani/safe-browsing-guard-chrome), promoting transparency and community contributions.\n\n14. Why does the pinned extension icon sometimes change?\n>> The extension icon changes to visually alert you about potentially suspicious websites or downloads, even if alerts are turned off. A green checkmark means normal browsing, while an orange shield indicates a potential issue. \n\n15. Safe Browsing Guard flagged a link on social media. Is it a phishing attempt?\n>> Possibly. Be cautious with links on social media, even from trusted contacts. Safe Browsing Guard can help identify suspicious links, but always double-check before clicking. If unsure, contact the sender directly through another channel to verify.\n\n16. I use other chrome extensions. Will Safe Browsing Guard interfere with it?\n>> Safe Browsing Guard should not interfere with other extensions. \n\n\nPrivacy Policy \n\nThis extension does not collect or transmit any user data. All processing is done locally on your device.\n\nCredits\n\n* Icons based on Lucide Icons https://lucide.dev/\n* Created by Lokesh Motwani\n\nContribute/Report Issues/Get Support\n\nFound a bug?
