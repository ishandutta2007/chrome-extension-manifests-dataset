It does not allow for full wallet capability, but rather is laser focussed on only managing your accounts and providing signing capabilities to applications requesting access. As such, its prime purpose is managing the accounts and injecting them as per the standard extension interfaces, as described in https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension#api-interface.\n\nIt allows you to -\n\n- Add accounts, storing the account secrets in your extension storage\n- Allow application access to the signing capabilities of these accounts (you can accept/reject requests)\n- Allows you to sign transactions for Substrate, Polkadot and Kusama networks\n- In all of this no secretes leave the extension, only the signature is ever provided\n\nThe source for this extension is fully available, with the latest versions always matching up with the source repo at https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension"
