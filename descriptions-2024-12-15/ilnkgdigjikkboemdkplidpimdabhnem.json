We’ve all gone insane!”. If you have, then this plug-in is for you! Turn your online source of helplessness, disappointment, and sadness into a horror Lovecraft story. See just how ridiculous the world actually is.\n\n\nThis plug-in will replace the world’s leaders names with Cthulhu's Mythos deities. All the cult favourites, such as Cthulhu, Azathoth, and Yog-Sothoth are there, and watch them bring chaos (and absurdity) to our lives. \n\n\nThis plug-in is brought to you by Frogwares, the video games studio behind the Lovecraft-inspired investigation game The Sinking City."
