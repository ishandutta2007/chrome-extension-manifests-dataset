It is quick and simple to install and get using immediately. \n\nSimply record your Chrome tab, browser window or computer screen. Whilst recording take a quick snapshot, draw a sketch or write some text notes to comment on the screen.\n\nSnapshots allow you to capture exactly what's on the screen so you can share with your colleagues, users or visitors. Draw sketches on the browser screen to bring attention to something you need to share.  Write notes into a moveable text widget so you can share your thoughts or notes with others.\n\nComplete deep user journeys whilst recording across links and browser tabs to gain and share greater context. When you're finished, capture basic browser and operating system information to share and aid debugging.\n\nSome of our favourite use cases for Recordable :\n\n- Designers : Generate a video to share user flows with the team and sketch highlights to draw attention\n- Developers : Capture a screen shot when you want to share a part of a website with a remote colleague\n- Product Managers : Record and enhance your product demos so they can be watched again and again\n- QA : Record the customer journey where you've captured a bug and write detailed step by step notes to complement the defect report\n\nRecordable's continual discovery is user led.
