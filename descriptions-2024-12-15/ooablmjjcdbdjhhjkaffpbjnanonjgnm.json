Not interested in the latest JavaScript framework? Had enough of the Rust lovefest? Now you can kill stories you're not interested in before they soil your precious eyes.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. When you're on HN, you'll see the little YCombinator logo enable.\n2. Click it and type create a comma-separated list of words into the textarea.\n\nYou keywords are persisted across popup opens and browser sessions via localStorage.\n\nThose words are used to filter out unwanted stories. The filtration happens on page load and when the list is changed (debounce of 1 sec). The removed stories are printed to the console."
