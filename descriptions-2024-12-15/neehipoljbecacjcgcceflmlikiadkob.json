Usually same requests are cached but if you want to check multiple files in different repositories, you can quickly \"run out\" of requests.\n\nMost of the limitations above are there only because I wanted to save time and focused on solving the core idea behind the extension.\n\nThe source code behind this extension is available on GitHub (https://github.com/dzhavat/potential-changes-for-github). If you want to follow the development, file an issue or contribute, please check out the repo.\n\nGit icon used in the Store icon is made by <a href=\"https://www.freeicons.io/profile/714\">Raj Dev</a> from www.freeicons.io"
