This enables you to easily track your expenses wherever you are.\n\nTo record a transaction in MoneyLover, instead of opening the mobile app and going through multiple steps, you can simply input a description of the transaction into MoneyLover Assistant the way you think of it. \n\nFor example, you can input “Breakfast for 10k in cash” and MoneyLover Assistant will automatically create a transaction under the “Food & drink” category with a value of 10,000 in the “Cash” wallet in MoneyLover. \n\nYou can also record multiple transactions in one message.\n\nTry it for yourself. May your habit change forever.\n\n—\nNOTICE:\nThis feature is currently in the testing phase and only available for a small group of users.
