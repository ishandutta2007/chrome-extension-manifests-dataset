Deepstash is all about short and meaningful ideas, extracted from books, articles or videos, curated by a community of millions of passionate, smart people like you. Give up the notion of forgotten reading lists and cluttered tabs, welcome short & organized content for everyone.\n\nSTASH WHAT MATTERS\nThe Deepstash extension makes it possible to stash all the ideas that you want to save and share, wherever you might find them: in articles, videos, podcasts and more. You can organize them and share with your fellow stashers and friends. From the toolbar, you can easily save any link to Deepstash and then scribble down some ideas, or highlight fragments and send them instantly to your account.\n\nFor each content piece, add as many ideas as you like and customize each one to increase the quality of your thoughts: use titles, add images, turn some into quotes; make them yours.\n\nBE A CURATOR OF GOOD IDEAS\nDeepstash is committed to creating a community where smart people like you share ideas that improve lives. Curating the best ideas out there is an act of creation that helps us all be smarter and more knowledgeable. If you've so far been saving your thoughts to Evernote, or OneNote, now you can save them to Deepstash and help others find out new stuff & save time. Stash away!\n\nWHY USE IT\n- Stash ideas a lot faster and easier.\n- Have an audience and publish your thoughts for you and to inspire others.\n- Everything you stash is available on any device, mobile or desktop, through Deepstash\n- Deepstash is 100% free (ad-free also) and is used by over one million users.\n\n\"Deepstash is to ideas & knowledge what Pinterest is to photos & crafts.\"\n\nPro tip: for when you're on the go, you can also try our app. Knowledge that fits in your pocket has never been more accessible. Curation, simplified. \n\nLET'S BE SOCIAL\n\nFind our media kit on Notion - https://www.notion.so/deepstash/MEDIA-KIT-0ce53be763e14ab99a7538e647db5b7f\n\nFind us on Pinterest - https://www.pinterest.com/deepstash/_saved/"
