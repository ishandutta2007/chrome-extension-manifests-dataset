It's used as a reminder of the inevitability of death. Rather than be morbid it's aimed at reminding you to make the most of the time you have left and live more in the moment - YOLO!\n\nThe countdown is shown over the top of (customisable) images, with optional inspiring quotes displayed too. This update also adds the ability to add events to the timeline.\n\nSettings can be used to customise:\n* background image\n* add /edit quotes (new)\n* add /edit key events (new)\n* show / hide title\n* show / hide quotes\n* customise text colour (new)\n\nFuture iterations will add these features:\n* add extra languages\n* search Unsplash images directly from extension\n* upload your own images\n\n# NOTES\n\n## Images\nCurrently images are limited to displaying images using a URL. This is in part due to browser restrictions in story image data. Future version may allow the user to \"upload\" their own images.\nFuture version may also allow user to search for Unsplash images from within the extension and apply them automatically (without the need to paste the URL)\n\n\n## ChangeLog\n1.0.0.0 Improve calculations. Add editable quotes/events. Make the number of years / columns editable.\n\n0.0.0.7 - Fix bug in calculations\n0.0.0.6 - Improve responsiveness, date validation\n0.0.0.5 - Improve Initialisation\n0.0.0.4 - Support custom images; improve responsiveness\n0.0.0.3 - Add more image options\n0.0.0.2 - Improve Initialisation\n0.0.0.1 - Initial Release"
