Before email addresses were required for everything from government accounts to signing up for that new community forum that you want to post on? We do! And we're helping you to not have to worry about that level of privacy again.\n\nImagine a way to keep a single email address organized, protected from unwanted exposure, and above all, easily detect when a service you use has leaked or sold your email address to the highest bidder. Where you have control over who knows your real address, and can control the flow and classification of emails at the click of the mouse.\n\nGood news everyone! We're building those capabilities right now!\n\nNotMyRealEamil is a privacy-focused, email aliasing service that aims to bring a slice of calm, comfort, and organization to this newly connected digital landscape.\n\nHarness the power of email aliases today and protect yourself from spam, scams, and unnecessary exposure."
