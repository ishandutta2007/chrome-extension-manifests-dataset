Save and organize your browser workspaces as Main Quests and Side Quests, allowing you to instantly restore entire sets of tabs with a single click. With the use of a single keyboard shortcut, copy all currently open Chrome tab URL's of a particular Chrome window and instantly save them to a user configurable \"Quest Button\". Each Quest Button, when clicked, immediately opens all saved tabs in a new Chrome window. Quest Buttons represent \"workspaces\" or a flow of continuous thought when researching. There is very useful contextual information in the way someone opens up many concurrent tabs, some might say it's a quest of sorts, this is often lost. CyberQuest preserves that context by saving exact window states, locally, forever. \n\nKey Features:\n\nüéÆ Quest System:\n‚Ä¢ Main Quests - For your primary workspaces\n‚Ä¢ Side Quests - For secondary or alternative tab collections\n‚Ä¢ Custom naming for each quest\n‚Ä¢ Edit and manage URLs within each quest\n‚Ä¢ Delete quests when completed\n\n‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts:\nMacOS:\n‚Ä¢ Create Main Quest: ‚åò + M\n‚Ä¢ Create Side Quest: ‚åò + Shift + S\n\nWindows:\n‚Ä¢ Create Main Quest: Ctrl + M\n‚Ä¢ Create Side Quest: Ctrl + Shift + S\n\nüíæ Data Management:\n‚Ä¢ Auto-save feature with toggle switch\n‚Ä¢ Manual save/download of quest data\n‚Ä¢ Upload previously saved quests\n‚Ä¢ Backup and restore functionality\n‚Ä¢ Duplicate quest detection to prevent redundant workspaces\n\nüé® User Interface:\n‚Ä¢ Clean, intuitive design\n‚Ä¢ Dark/Light mode support\n‚Ä¢ Visual feedback for actions\n‚Ä¢ Tab count display\n‚Ä¢ Easy-to-use edit interface\n‚Ä¢ Drag-and-drop URL management\n\nüîÑ Smart Features:\n‚Ä¢ Automatic workspace restoration\n‚Ä¢ Duplicate workspace prevention\n‚Ä¢ Smart data persistence\n‚Ä¢ Cross-device compatibility\n‚Ä¢ Uninstall data protection\n\nüîí Privacy & Security:\n‚Ä¢ Works completely offline\n‚Ä¢ No data collection\n‚Ä¢ Local storage only\n‚Ä¢ No external dependencies\n\nPerfect for:\n‚Ä¢ Developers managing multiple simultaneous projects\n‚Ä¢ Researchers organizing reference materials\n‚Ä¢ Students handling course resources\n‚Ä¢ Project managers switching between tasks\n‚Ä¢ Anyone who wants to organize their browser tabs into themed workspaces\n‚Ä¢ Those needing to save system memory \n\nGet started on your tab management quest today!
