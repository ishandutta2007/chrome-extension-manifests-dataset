This is NOT an official extension, just a random guy working on a fun and simple coding project in his spare time. Your grades are never sent to me as everything is handled on your computer. It uses the official Canvas API to grab your grades and overlays them on the dashboard's card view, so you'll want to make sure you set your dashboard view to \"Card View\" by clicking on the three vertical dots in the upper right corner and selecting the card view option."
