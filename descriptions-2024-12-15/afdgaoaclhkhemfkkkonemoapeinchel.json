(yes, really!)\n\nüé® What's New & Awesome:\n- Live wallpapers that make your dashboard feel alive! Watch cherry blossoms float by while doing math \n (way better than staring at that blank white screen, right?)\n- Upload your own background images/videos because why not make SEQTA your happy place?\n- Pick ANY color you want! Purple SEQTA? Sure! Hot pink? Go wild! \n- Custom themes that transform SEQTA into something actually beautiful (we know, shocking!)\n\n‚ú® All The Good Stuff You Already Love:\n- Dark mode that won't burn your eyes at 11PM when you remember that assignment\n- Reorganize the menu (goodbye, things you never use!)\n- Next lesson notifications so you don't accidentally walk into English with your Science books\n- Better-looking... well, everything!\n- A homepage that actually makes sense (revolutionary, we know)\n\nüèÉ Quick Access to:\n- Your daily lessons (because who has time to click 17 buttons?)\n- Important notices (no more \"I didn't see it!\")\n- All the stuff you actually use (and none of the stuff you don't)\n\nüîç Find the magic here: https://github.com/betterseqta/betterseqta-plus\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Fine Print: This isn't officially from Education Horizons - we're just students who thought SEQTA needed some love! (And boy, did it need it...).\n\nPS: This is the cooler cousin of the original BetterSEQTA. Same family, more pizzazz! ‚ú®\n\nWe hope you LOVE this improved EDUCATION experience!!! :D"
