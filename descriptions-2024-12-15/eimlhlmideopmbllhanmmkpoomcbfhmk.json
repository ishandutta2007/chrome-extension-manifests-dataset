Focus on 'practicing' strength (or movement, mobility or anything else) rather than 'working out'.\n\nThe challenge I had was to remember to GTG while engrossed in my work, so... Grease the new tab extension!\n\nAlso a way for me to test out Svelte JS.\n\nA couple of things to note:\n\n1. All data is kept locally on your browser, this extension does not collect anything from your computer. As such, clearing your browser history will also delete all your data - please be mindful of this.\n\n2. The source code of this extension is open source - https://github.com/HemalR/grease - feel free to fork/contribute if you wish\n\nEnjoy and please drop any feedback."
