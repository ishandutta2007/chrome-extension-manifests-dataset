With mirrorboard, web space becomes a place to meet and chat with people, just like a physical space in the real world.\n\n‚òï Chat on Every Website\n\n- Explore instant communication space\n\n- Share your thoughts on the websites you like\n\nüì¢ Explore the Web‚Äôs Voice\n- Explore interesting topics shared by other users on mirrorboard.\n\n- Connect with people from around the world and discover their contributions on various websites.\n\nüïäÔ∏è mirrorboards exist for freedom of expression.\n\nHistorically, humankind has been evolving through exchanging opinions, sometimes quarreling and agreeing with one another.\n\nHowever, some websites remaining as a highly exclusive medium. \n\nThrough the use of websites, we receive one-sided information or services. \n\nWhen we wish to express our opinions on the web, it should be possible at any time on any given web page.\n\nIt would no longer matter even if some website doesn't provide any communication features (comments, forms, etc.). \n\nThere are as many spaces for communication as there are websites in the mirrorboard, and these spaces are our independent spaces for communication that cannot be controlled by web service providers. We call this independent communication space 'board'. Just like the blackboard, we can exchange information and opinions on our ‚Äòboard‚Äô of mirrorboard."
