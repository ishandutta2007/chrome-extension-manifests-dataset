This extension can be used to turn off the user's computer, hibernate it, or even run a custom command like playing a music song using a desktop application! Note that as of version 0.1.5, the extension keeps the system awake while the extension is enabled and there are active downloading jobs. This causes the system to not to go to the hibernate state. You can disable this feature on the options page.\n\nFor this extension to work, a native messaging application needs to be installed. For more info please visit\nhttps://add0n.com/auto-shutdown.html\n\nTo report bugs use:\nhttps://github.com/andy-portmen/auto-shutdown\n\nversion 0.1.2:\nIt is now possible to ask the extension to close the shutdown window (countdown window) when an external command is executed\nversion 0.1.4:\nKeep the shutdown window on top (can be disabled from the options page)"
