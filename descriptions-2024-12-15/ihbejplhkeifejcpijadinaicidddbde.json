If you need a break, you can disable Todobook for the day via the Todobook icon in your browser's toolbar.\n\nTodobook DOES NOT access, read, edit, or store ANY of your data on Facebook, and never will. And it will NEVER post anything to Facebook on your behalf. It also requires access to your navigation history so that it can detect when you're on facebook.com. It DOES NOT read, transmit, or store any browsing history, it simply detects your current url.\n\nTip: You can configure the break time, the frequency of breaks, and you can turn on 'work hours' via the gear icon in the top right of the extension UI once you've loaded facebook.com. If you turn on 'work hours', the extension will only be active between 8am and 6pm, Monday through Friday.\n\n\"This Chrome extension makes your Facebook addiction productive\" - Mashable\n\"The best Facebook productivity tool ever built.\" - Wersm.com\n\"Turns Facebook into a super-smart productivity tool.\" - The Next Web"
