Refer your network to jobs and get paid - it's that simple.\n\nOur scouts (referrers) compete to refer the most talented people they know - and earn thousands of dollars when they succeed.\n\nAnyone can be a scout - you, your siblings, your partner, your colleagues - anyone.\n\nBut every scout earns a rating (“Reputation Score”) based on the quality of their referrals (we have a unique way of tracking candidates’ progress through companies’ recruiting processes).\n\nEarn a high score? Refer away to your heart’s content.\n\nBut end up with a low score? You’re out.\n\nSome quick highlights:\n\n🥳100% free to use - doesn’t cost a penny for you to make referrals or for companies to list their roles/referral bonuses.\n\n🥳Scouts are everyday people - Substackers, recruiters, super-connectors and everyday employees at tech startups like Amazon, Spotify, Deel and TikTok.\n\n🥳We only work with top-tier tech companies - 85+ customers including late-stage (SeatGeek, Bilt, Formlabs, Via), mid-stage (OneSignal, Speechify, TheGuarantors) and early-stage startups (Mealco, Basis, Accrue).\n\n🥳Refer in seconds (literally) - copy your unique referral link and share it any way you want - WhatsApp, text, email, Telegram, etc. You’ll get notified as soon as the candidate applies.\n\n🥳Nurture your Reputation Score - you get to approve or reject all applications that come in via your link - make sure to approve only the good ones so your score stays high!\n\n🥳Full transparency - see the bonus amount upfront; track your referral’s progress through the interview process; see the status of your payment; and more\n\n🥳Your referrals actually get reviewed - companies on Draftboard are prioritizing Draftboard referrals and responding to 80% of them; friends don’t let friends apply via job boards (where they never hear anything back).\n\n—-\n\nBy using the Draftboard browser extension, you agree to Draftboard’s terms and conditions.
