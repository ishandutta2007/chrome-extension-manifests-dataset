You can also add reminders and be notified via email/Slack when a certain TLS/SSL certificate is about to expire.\n\n⚠ Be updated on SSL certs expiration before errors start happening.\nSSL certificates are not valid forever. They expire. That means that every website needs to renew or replace its SSL certificate. So, what happens when your SSL certificate expires? It makes your site/services unreachable. That is essentially a death warrant for your site’s traffic, sales or whatever metric or KPI you value.\n\n⚠ No more red lights with SSL certificates.\nDont let cert renewal compromise your HTTPS availability. More often than not, script-generated haproxy configuration fails to pick new certificates and will put a red light on production status. Imagine that in a very high traffic web site and in your career."
