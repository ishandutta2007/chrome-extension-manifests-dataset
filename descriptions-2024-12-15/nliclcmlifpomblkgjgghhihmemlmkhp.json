Are you curious about who those people are in the comment section?\n\nThis simple Chrome extension adds a little icon to every comment within a Reddit thread. Once you hover over the icon, the extension will provide for you, in the graph style of your choosing, the subreddits that user is active in so you can get a quick sense of what kind of user you're looking at. This extension also tells you how active that particular user is on Reddit.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- ability to change what kind of graph appears (bar, donut, graph, pie and word cloud).\n- ability to change the icon of Reddit Comment Context.\n\nWhy did I make this?\n\nGood question. I'm a big Reddit user and I love spending time in the comments. However, it seems like a lot of highly upvoted comments might not be with people I want to engage with. I made this extension to quickly get a sense of the kind of person I'm engaging with to see if we have similar interests or if I should ignore them entirely.\n\nI hope this extension allows you to enjoy Reddit more fully!"
