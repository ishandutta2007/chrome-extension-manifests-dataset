For example, by typing '/poet' followed by a space, ChatGPT will provide a prompt that unleashes your inner poet.\n\nWhen the extension detects a slash command, it sends it to ChatGPT internally to produce an ideal prompt based on the command in real-time. So the number of possible shortcuts that you can generate is infinite.\n\nAll you need is an API Key from OpenAI's platform (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and a valid payment method (https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods).\n\nWe understand that privacy is important to you, which is why our extension does not collect any of your data. Your API key is also securely stored in your browser.\n\nFeeling stuck? Need some inspiration? Use this prompt in ChatGPT to check examples of shortcuts that you can use with this extension:\n\nCreate a markdown table that showcases 30 different roles for ChatGPT, including their descriptions. Simply connect the words in column 1 with hyphens and add a slash at the beginning."
