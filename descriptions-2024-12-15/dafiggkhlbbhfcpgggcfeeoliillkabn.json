It is an unofficial extension that is developed and maintained independently. This unofficial extension is a wrapper to the original Telegram and tries to enhance its usage.\n\nWith this addon, you get several privacy enhancements and badge-text notifications (when the interface is open). Please visit the options page to adjust the privacy and enhancement features. In privacy features, this addon can blur different segments within the Telegram web interface. By default, only the main body message section is active. Please mark desired items and see which one is best for you.\n\nTo report bugs, please use the addon's homepage and fill out the bug report form (https://mybrowseraddon.com/telegram-desktop.html)."
