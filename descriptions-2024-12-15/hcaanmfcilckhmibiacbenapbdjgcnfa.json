Each photo is sourced from the users of http://reddit.com/r/earthporn and credit goes to each user for every photo.\n\n**** Note *****\nThe app asks for your frequently visited websites so they can be optionally shown over top of the image. A lot of people have requested this feature, so I have added it as an option.  This information is only used locally, on your own computer. I do not retain this data.\n\nUpdates:\n\n1.0.1 - Make the tab title SFW :)\n\n1.0.0 - New name, source photos from multiple subreddits, enable recent sites and turn off title\n\n0.0.5 - Updated image request stability\n\n0.0.1 - First build!"
