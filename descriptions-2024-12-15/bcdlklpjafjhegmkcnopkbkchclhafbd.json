You can set up notifications for the following scenarios:\n\n◎ When a new NFT listing appears on any marketplace under a specific price so you can snipe from paperhands. \n\n◎ When a new NFT listing appears with specific trait(s) under a certain price so you can snipe a rare one for cheap.\n\n◎ When the Floor Price of a specific NFT Collection rises so you can dump your bags.\n\n◎ When the Floor Price of a specific NFT Collection dumps so you can paperhand your NFTs if needed.\n\n◎ Find historical sales data for NFTs with specific traits (so you can see what the actual selling price was for your rare NFT in the past few days/weeks/months not just the \"Floor Price\" of that trait). \n\nHow it works:\n\nBrowse projects on Hyperspace.xyz, find the collection you are interested in. If you are looking specific traits select them on Hyperspace first. Open our extension. Have fun.\n\nFree from the Parrot team."
