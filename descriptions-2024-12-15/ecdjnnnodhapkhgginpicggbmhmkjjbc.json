Otherwise you can link the company to an existing record, however, if you’re in a rush this can be skipped as we have a setting to automatically append the company name to the job title, which makes generating longlists a much faster process.\n\nUsing this extension has no additional login requirements and doesn't even require you to manually log in using your Invenias credentials! As long as you’re already logged in to your Invenias Web App in another browser tab then you’re already logged in to this extension – it’s that simple!\n\nBy using this extension you are agreeing to our terms: https://coralstarfish.com/terms"
