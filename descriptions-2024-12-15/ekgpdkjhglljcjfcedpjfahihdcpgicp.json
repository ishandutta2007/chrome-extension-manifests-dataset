Additionally, all operations are performed on your device without any external communication, ensuring privacy and security.\n\n=== Simple ===\nYou really just to need to remember your single secret passphrase (optionally hashing algorithm if you choose not to use the default), to get to any of your passwords. You can also take advantage of Recall, Remember or App Name Prefill functionalities, to recreate your passwords with one-click.\n\n=== Accessible ===\nGetMeKey runs in any browser and there is no backend infrastructure - everything is done directly in the browser. As long as you have any browser at hand, you can get to any of your passwords - even offline.\n\n=== Transparent ===\nGetMeKey is build and served with clear, formatted source code - anyone can review what it does in realtime. GetMeKey is also open-source, so whole development history is publicly available.\n\n=== Free ===\nWhole idea of the GetMeKey is to provide user-friendly way how to run lightweight cryptographic hashing algorithm directly on your device. This means GetMeKey doesn't need any heavy infrastructure to be maintained - no expenses, no reason to monetize."
