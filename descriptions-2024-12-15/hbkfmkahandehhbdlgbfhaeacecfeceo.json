So once one of your passwords is leaked, the other accounts are still safe.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to remember all passwords for different websites. So there are several solutions for password management, like LastPass, 1Password or KeePass.\n\nBut are they really safe? LastPass had been hacked. Keep them local? You must synchronize manually. How can we balance the safety and convenience?\n\nAmaranth provides a simple password management solution. You just need to remember only one password (we call it main password), and set different site id for accounts on different sites (you can directly use the brand name like google or apple). Amaranth will calculate the password for you.\n\nOnly you have main password, and site id, Amaranth can calculate correct password for you. If any of this 2 is wrong, Amaranth will provide different password. The benefits of this are that you only need to remember this specific main password IN YOUR BRAIN, and Amaranth can give you any password you need at any devices without synchronization and storage.\n\nSo Amaranth is unhackable because it dose not store any of your password. It only provides an algorithm to generate them.\n\nIt also comes with different type of password in case there is requirement in websites or services. For example, some website require longer password length (more than 10) but some service (like bank) require PIN as password. Amaranth provides 4 kinds of passwords which is PIN, Short, Classic and Long.\n\nAccording to HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD?, the Long type password needs 3 TRILLION YEARS to crack (as in 2016).\n\nThe benifits of using Amaranth:\n\nSafe, unhackable. Even your computer is stolen, the passwords will never leak.\nEasy to remember. User just need to remember a main password and a rule of site id.\nMain password is only used to generate password, never used in actual websites.\nNo need to think a new password for new account.\nThere is also a shortcoming, if you choose this solution, you need to change your current passwords."
