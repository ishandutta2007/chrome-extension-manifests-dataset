Perfect for all kinds of online interactions. \n\nUsing it is very simple:\nOnce you go through the categories, simply click on the emoji and it automatically gets copied to your clipboard. NO MANUAL SELECTING REQUIRED.\n\nThere is something magical about Japanese emojis, they are a bit funky but unlike western ones they really excel at conveying emotions, and at the same time supported everywhere where unicode is allowed(count it as everywhere by now).\n\nUnfortunately I could not find a worthwhile solution to get those emojis quickly without having to copy them from somewhere, and I missed the way you get to pick 'ascii' emojis on the iPhone. So this is my small homage to fill the missing niche that should have been filled a long time ago, yet somehow wasn't.\n\nHave pleasure using it. Those for whom it was written will certainly appreciate it.\n\nEmojis are provided by JapaneseEmoticons.net and jamieism.com."
