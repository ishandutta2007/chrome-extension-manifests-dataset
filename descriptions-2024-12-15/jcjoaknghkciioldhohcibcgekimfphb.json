With MarkMaker, it's as simple as adding a special tag to your profile.\n\nBasic Usage: Append \"MarkMaker: <url>\" at the end of your profile's About Me section, and fellow extension users will experience your profile in Markdown! (\"url\" being the URL for your raw-text markdown file)\n\nGitHub Integration: Want to display your GitHub README.md on LinkedIn? Use \"MarkMaker: git@<username>\" and let MarkMaker seamlessly integrate your GitHub bio.\n\nCustom Branch: If your README.md is on a branch other than \"main,\" specify it by adding your branch name before your username, separated by any character. For example, \"MarkMaker: git@master>SomeGithubUser\" (\"git@\" is not case sensitive).\n\nImportant Note: To ensure a smooth experience for all users, MarkMaker adopts a bottom-line approach to avoid displaying raw markdown to those without the extension.\n\nDon't have a Markdown file but want to know what the end result would look like? Use \"MarkMaker: #test\" to get an example markdown file!\n\nInstall MarkMaker now and enhance your LinkedIn profile with the power of Markdown!\n\n\nClarification on extension:\nMarkMaker will NOT overwrite your \"About Me\" section on LinkedIn. Any and all changes made by this extension are temporary. MarkMaker replaces the HTML presented with a parsed Markdown file, styled like GitHub. In order for anyone else to see your Markdown file, they will need the extension installed as well.\n\nWant to see what's behind the scenes?
