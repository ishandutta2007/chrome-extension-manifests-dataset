This is where Whatsapp Web Dark Mode comes in. Following the already defined dark mode color scheme on the android version, it brings the darkness to your webscreens so you don't have to wait for Whatsapp to.\n\n--KNOWN ISSUES--\n- The emojis on whatsapp are images and not unicode characters (e.g ðŸ˜…), I'd bet for emoji style consistency across platforms. These images have white backgrounds and that's on Whatsapp.\n- A couple of other images have white backgrounds across the entire application too, in the event you come across this images, they are not of my doing.\n\n--RELEASES--\n- v0.1 - Initial Release"
