It primarily works in the Avalanche, and Fantom ecosystem, but is working to support collections in other chains like Ethereum, and HBAR.\n\nIt displays popular NFTs Collections in your wallet, stats about their treasury and the wallet's balances for popular rebase tokens like TIME, OHM, LOBIS, and BTRFLY.\n\nSimply enter a valid eth based address that you want to track (eg: 0x9a0145d1b1b17293e7f722f80757d2b6489f0a4c)  or connect with compatible wallet through wallet connect from your phone.\n\nThis extension is published as v3 extension, and such, cannot manipulate dom elements, and does not interact with smart contracts directly (but rather, requests read-only data from the blockchain)."
