Just tap on the extension, hit the record button, and start talking! üé§ \n\nWe've designed this with the craftsmanship of a 5th century artisan. Think of Siri on steroids. SpeakMagic is 10x better. üò§\n\nHere's why:\n\n‚≠ê 1. Magical speech-to-text transcription ‚≠ê\nOur tool has been battle-tested for medical transcription and physiotherapy clinics. If we can handle words like soleus, gastrocnemius, and palpation - we're confident that we can handle anything you'll throw at it. \n\n‚≠ê 2. Custom commands ‚≠ê \nThe biggest barrier in traditional speech-to-text tools is manually formatting the output. No more. Add custom commands - SpeakMagic then \"listens\" for those commands and acts accordingly. New lines. Punctuation. Emojis. Anything is possible.\n\n‚≠ê 3. Undo for speech ‚≠ê\nDon't you hate it when Siri mistakes \"Call Mo's Pizza\" for \"Fall ghost eater\"? Same. That's why we added the undo button for speech. Simple - but effective.\n\n‚≠ê 4. Easy copy ‚≠ê \nSpeakMagic works where you need it! Use the tool, and easily copy the output to take with you. Formatting is preserved :)\n\nWe have a lot more planned ahead - but we're excited to hear your feedback! Give us a shout at info@filtr.pub with your thoughts and suggestions.\n\n(AI) God speed üöÄ"
