This extension predicts the most likely words at each step based on your previous guesses and popularity of all 5-letter words in the English alphabet.\n\nWhen you start, it suggests five starter words to choose from. After the first row, the predictor engine kicks and does a lot of heavy lifting for you; if you want of course. You will only see a simple icon that works behind the scenes and triggers the predictor after each guess so it's ready whenever you need help. All you have to do is click the icon to see the top 5 options.\n\nTo make picking options easier, whenever you hover on a word, it is instantly inserted into the empty row temporarily so you can easily see how the letters place compared to previous guesses"
