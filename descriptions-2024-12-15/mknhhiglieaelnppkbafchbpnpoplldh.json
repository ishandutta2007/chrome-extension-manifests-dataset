The Cliq Chrome Extension is part of the Cliq CRM + ATS. It allows recruiters to easily take notes, add tags, and set reminders without ever needing to change tabs in your browser.\n\nWith the notes feature, you'll be able to easily take notes on a candidate as you view their profile online. The tags feature allows you to add detailed tags for categorize so that you can easily find who you're looking for in the Cliq CRM later. And finally, the reminders feature allows you to add reminders so that you will never forget to follow up (GSuite integration coming soon to the calendar!)."
