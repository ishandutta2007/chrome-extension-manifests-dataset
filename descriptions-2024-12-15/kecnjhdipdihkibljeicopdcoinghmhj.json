The Future Audiences team at the Wikimedia Foundation built an experimental AI tool to help you more quickly add information to English Wikipedia without going to the website. You can now send information to be debated or added to articles to article talk pages without leaving your current open tab.\n\nHow it works:\n\n • While browsing the web, select a short passage of text to add to Wikipedia.\n • Using Llama3-70b, the Add A Fact extension quickly searches for and analyzes Wikipedia articles that may be most relevant for the fact you’ve found to land in. \n • You will get back information about whether the fact you’ve found is in, partially mentioned or not at all in the relevant articles.\n • If none of the articles are to your liking, you can search for your preferred one.\n • Then add the fact with your comments to the article talk page to edit into the article later yourself, or to be debated or added by others.\n • Note: to use the posting functionality, you will need to be logged into a Wikimedia account that has autoconfirmed user rights (registered for 4+ days and with at least 10 edits) on English Wikipedia.\n\nWe need your help! \n\nThis is an experimental feature that uses generative AI, which we know can sometimes make mistakes. \n\nTo help us understand and improve the quality of results, please report any issues you’re seeing via the feedback link in the extension. We also welcome general feedback and ideas for other ways Wikipedia could be useful in your day-to-day web browsing.\n\nAbout Us:\n\nThis extension was developed by the Future Audiences team at the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that supports Wikipedia and its sister projects."
