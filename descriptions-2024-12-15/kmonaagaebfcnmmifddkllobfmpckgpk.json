They are great but long, draggy & conversational, which is orthogonal to the human learning model resulting in more passive consumption than active learning. We aim to bridge that gap - to not just listen but learn.\n\nThis Extension is a first step to a new beginning for audio based consumption. Convert and learn articles on the go. and we would convert these articles in humanized versions and you can hear them from our app.\n\nCurrently, we have built a web & mobile app (Android and iOS)\n\nWhat Airvoice does today:\nStreams informative, byte-sized & structured audio content by industry experts, which listeners can learn on their schedule.\nTranscriptions, chapter summaries, workbooks & resources to promote active learning in listeners.\nFlashcards & Quizzes to help listeners not just learn but also to retain information.\nLets creators create exclusive audio courses & monetize them easily."
