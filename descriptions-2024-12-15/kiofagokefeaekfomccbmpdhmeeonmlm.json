The main code is in content.js. You can ask chatGPT to add any features you want to that file such as changing the layout of the buttons or colors. You can inspect element howdy.tamu.edu to see what the elements are named and how it's organized to efficiently add more features.\n\nYou can then download the repository here:\nhttps://github.com/SriramGaddam5/HowdyPortalPlus/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\n\nUnzip the folder and enable developer mode in chrome://extensions at the top right corner.\nClick load unpacked on the top left to where you saved the repository.\n\nEach time you make a change to content.js you need to manually refresh howdy.tamu.edu page and press the refresh button in chrome://extensions for Howdy Portal Plus.\n\nYou can see the code here: https://github.com/SriramGaddam5/HowdyPortalPlus"
