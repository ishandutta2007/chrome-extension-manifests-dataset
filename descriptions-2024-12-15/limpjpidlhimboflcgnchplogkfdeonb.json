(Stipend, Branches, Project Description, ect).\nThe injected panel also provide new ways to add/remove items to the top or to the bottom of the already sorted list, helping in much faster. No need to go to different pages to get different info.\nThe extension also allows you to save and load your preferences as an excel sheet. This way, you can share it with your friends, and also have a backup in case PSMS bugs out and does not save preferences.\n\nWhat's New:\nUpdated the extension to work on the new site for second-semester."
