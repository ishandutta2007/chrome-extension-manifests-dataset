You can use \"example.com\" or \"www.example.com\" for exact match OR use wildchar like \"*example.com\" to match example.com with all it's subdomains. Note that if you put dot between wildchar and domain name you would only match subdomains and not your naked domain name.\n\nExtension is available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera.\n\n:: Contact & Report Issues:\n   https://www.igorware.com/contact\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Changelog\n\nv3.4.0\n- added support for GA4\n\nv3.3.1\n- improved Google Analytics script detection\n\nv3.3.0\n- improved extension icon and tooltip handling\n- added CSP for better security\n\nv3.2.2\n- fixed issue with website importer not checking if domain attribute exists\n\nv3.2.1\n- small improvement for options page\n\nv3.2.0\n- fixed a known issue with websites that use service workers\n- updated minimum requirements to Chrome v63 (technical reasons)\n\nv3.1.0\n- support for ga-lite (Google Analytics Lite)\n- support for Beacon API\n\nv3.0.5\n- fixed issue with tab switching in extension options\n\nv3.0.4\n- code cleanup\n- updated minimum requirements to Chrome v29\n\nv3.0.3\n- fixed logger script\n\nv3.0.2\n- improved logger script\n\nv3.0.1\n- fixed an issue where options page would not work if opened before extension has been initialised\n- improved logger script\n\nv3.0.0\n - extension icon will now behave a bit differently, it will not be disabled for \"system\" pages so you will still be able to access extension's popup menu\n - moved localStorage to storage API (rewrite of extension's storage)\n - changed default message for extension's icon tooltip to avoid confusion\n - enabled chrome_style for options, this should make sure options have more consistent UI with Chrome\n - added error logger (this will help me catch errors sooner)\n - other small fixes\n - minimum browser requirement is now Chrome v22\n\n\n===> Full changelog available on the website"
