If your answer is yes, feel free to buy me a ☕️ cutting chai below.\n\nhttps://agamjot.ca/donate\n\nWith the new features, I'm incurring some server costs, which are paid out-of-pocket. Maintaining and updating these projects takes a lot of time, and I’m not paid for it. A few donations here and there help me stay motivated and focused on these projects. If you cannot donate, that's alright, but if you can, it would be greatly appreciated. 🙏\n\nMade by the Pennytalks Discord server.\n\nSource Code  💻:\nhttps://github.com/devAgam/chartink-to-tradingview-firefox-extension"
