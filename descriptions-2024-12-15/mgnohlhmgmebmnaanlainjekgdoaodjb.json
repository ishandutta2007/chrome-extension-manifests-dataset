Did you keep searching the same words over and over again hoping that you could have a tool to help you master it? \n\nThis why I've created this Flashcard Dictionary extension. It contains three major functions. \nHighlight to search\nList of searched words\nQuiz\n\nWith this, I hope that your reading experience will be better and you will be able to master new words easier. Happy reading!\n\nThis project is originally written for CS50's final project. \nhttps://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science\n\nThis extension is based on Dictionary Anywhere by meetDeveloper\nhttps://github.com/meetDeveloper/Dictionary-Anywhere\n\nThis extension also uses the Google Dictionary API by meetDeveloper\nhttps://github.com/meetDeveloper/googleDictionaryAPI\n\nLast but not least, the extension's icon is from iconmonstr\nhttps://iconmonstr.com/"
