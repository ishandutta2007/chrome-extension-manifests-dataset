Waking up on the wrong side of the bed may be less about how much shuteye you get and more about where you are in your sleep cycle when you awaken. Humans experience multiple cycles while asleep, and waking in the middle of the wrong one could cause drowsiness. Therefore, you should know how much rest you need to avoid waking mid-cycle, and the good news is we are here to help. We’ll walk you through how to use our sleep calculator to maximize your rest. Plus, we’ll go over what happens while you sleep, why quality rest is important, and more."
