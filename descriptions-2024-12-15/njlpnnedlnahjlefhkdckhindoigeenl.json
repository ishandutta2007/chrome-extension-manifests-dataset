We provide a JavaScript library for integration, which is on GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/johnSSG/RFIDBlock\n\nWhat is RFID Technology?\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) as a tracking tool has broad applications. An RFID tag or chip, which comes in a small form factor, can be attached to anything from packages and devices to vital records. The antenna on the tag receives a signal, and a reader device interprets it to carry out the tracking capabilities. The reader device can parse the information and send it to another device on your network or even a web application in the cloud.\n\nMany businesses use RFID technology due to its broad application, versatility, scalability, and ability to enhance productivity, quality assurance, and efficiency.\n\nWhat is the RF2400 Block RFID Reader?\nThe RFID Block is a standalone RFID reader/writer designed as a plug-and-play device when connected to your PCâ€™s USB port. Incorporating the RF 2400 reader/writer board, the RFID Block has low power requirements to enable it to use the power from the USB port with no other connection required.\n\nRequirements\n- RF2400 RFID Block Reader\n- A web application with the RFIDBlock class from github (or your own library using the events from that source code)\n- Our executable (optional, you can develop your own console app for this part):\nhttps://simplicity.online/EnsyncBlock.msi\n\nDrivers for the device:\nhttps://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/\n\nRFID integration is a complex task.
