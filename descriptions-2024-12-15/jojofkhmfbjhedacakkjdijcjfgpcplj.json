My one gripe has always been their lax calculations (missing Cost Basis and Net Costs) even at the Pro Level... so, here's this!\n\nHow to use this:\n1. Install the extension\n2. Login to your CoinStats account via their web interface\n3. Visit the /transactions page of any coin you're currently HODLing. \n4. Click the extension in your toolbar to add a Cost Basis and Net Costs calculation to the table header.\n\nYou should end up with something like the image below.\n\nFormulas used in this extension:\n\n-- Net Costs -- Sum of all costs (from purchases) minus Sum of all proceeds (from sells). Fees aren't currently factored into this due to different fee currencies, but may be at a later date. In general, your Net Costs should equal your coin's Total Worth + All Time P&L. If sum of all proceeds is greater than sum of all costs, this number will be negative. Congrats!\n\n-- Cost Basis(Average Net Cost) -- Net costs divided by your current holdings. I find this to be more worthwhile than the \"AVG BUY\" number that CoinStats offers as it's a better representation of your current position today.\n\nHopefully I'll add more calculations as time goes by but feel free to respond here if you'd like to request one.\n\n*** NOTE: This must be for a single coin, not the all transactions page. If you have more transactions for that coin than can fit on a single page, make sure to click \"Load More\" at the bottom of the page to load all your relevant transactions before activating the extension."
