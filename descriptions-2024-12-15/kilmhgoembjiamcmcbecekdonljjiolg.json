No account needed—just install and start using.\n\nKey Features 🔧\nCapture HTTP Traffic in Real Time 📡\nRelay intercepts HTTP and HTTPS requests as you browse, making it easy to filter by method (GET, POST, etc.) or URL so you only see the requests that matter.\n\nModify Requests Instantly ✏️\nEdit every aspect of a captured request, from the base URL and HTTP method to headers, query parameters, and body content. You can even adjust response details for flexible testing.\n\nRun API Requests in the Browser ⚡\nSend and test API requests directly in your browser with immediate feedback—no need for external tools. You can also export requests as cURL commands if you need them for other uses.\n\nSave Your Sessions 📂\nOrganize and revisit your sessions, so you can easily review and analyze past requests when needed."
