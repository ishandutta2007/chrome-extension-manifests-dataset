You can effortlessly switch between tabs and windows, search and filter tabs by title or URL keywords, and efficiently manage various aspects such as pinned tabs, tab sorting, grouping tabs by domain, suspending tabs, identifying tabs with sound, and removing duplicates. Additionally, you have the option to export tabs and windows as backup files, save tabs for future use, and synchronize them across multiple devices.\n\nOur window manager presents a multiple column layout that enables you to gain a comprehensive overview of all your open windows and tabs while providing the flexibility to organize your windows by renaming them. Through simple drag and drop functionality, you can easily move tabs between windows, open them in new windows, or merge entire windows.\n\nThe tab manager also offers convenient features to save tabs for later restoration. You can save specific tabs within a window, save all tabs within a window, or save the entire session encompassing all open windows.\n\n★ Tab Groups\nThe tab manager comes with built-in support for managing your tab-groups. You can easily create a new tab group, move groups between windows, merge tab groups, rename tab groups and save your tab groups and restore them with the window at a later time.\n\n★ Session Manager\nThe session manager provides a comprehensive view of all your saved windows and sessions, allowing you to effortlessly manage and swiftly restore previously saved windows and sessions. Our intelligent restore feature ensures that opening tabs in a new or existing window does not slow down your computer, as tabs are opened in a suspended state. You can also sync your saved windows and sessions to the cloud, ensuring data integrity and accessibility across all your devices.\n\n★ Session History\nYou can access a timeline overview of your browser sessions, enabling you to easily restore individual windows or tabs from earlier points in time. Save session snapshots from either the manager or the menu, providing you with the flexibility to quit your browser or temporarily use a blank browser without the risk of losing your tabs and windows. Enabling the auto-save session feature helps you track your local browser session history in case of a browser crash.\n\nTabmanager.io is designed to provide all these features in a compact size compared to our competitors. We strongly believe that great software should utilize minimal system resources while delivering optimal performance.\n\nFeatures:\n\n▪ Overview of active Windows and Tabs\n▪ Keyboard navigation support\n▪ Rename Windows\n▪ Switch between Tabs and Windows\n▪ Multiple Window columns for wide screens\n▪ Light/Dark theme\n▪ Filter Tabs with search\n▪ Drag and drop Tabs and Windows\n▪ Merge Windows by drag and drop\n▪ Group Tabs by domain\n▪ Sort Tabs\n▪ Remove duplicate Tabs\n▪ Suspend/Discard Tabs from memory\n▪ Find Tabs playing audio\n▪ Mute/Unmute Tab playing audio\n▪ Create new Tab-group\n▪ Drag and Drop Tab-group\n▪ Merge Tab-groups\n▪ Save Tab-groups for later\n▪ Save Tabs for later\n▪ Save Windows for later\n▪ Save Session for later\n▪ Quickly restore Windows and Sessions\n▪ Share Windows by URL\n▪ Automatic Sessions history snapshot\n▪ Take Session snapshots for easy restore later\n▪ Export Tabs, Window or Session as JSON/CSV\n▪ Import exported Tabs, Window or Session\n▪ Backup & Sync\n▪ Cloud Backups\n▪ And more...\n\nSend us an email at support@tabmanager.io if you need support or have suggestions about missing features."
