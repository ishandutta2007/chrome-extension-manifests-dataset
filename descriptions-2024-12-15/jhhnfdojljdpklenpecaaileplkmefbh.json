Once you click on the icon, you will see a popup window that has a single button - to Activate or Deactivate the extension. Once activated, the extension injects a script into the site you are viewing and automatically translates all text that has already been translated by other users. \n\nYou can provide translations as well by joining the Translation Exchange and activating translation mode.\n\nAll you need to do is visit TranslationExchange.com and register as a new user. Once registered, you can enable the inline translation tools by using Ctrl+Shift+I shortcut keys. This would underline all of the translated text using green color and the text that hasn't been translated yet in red.\n\nRight-Mouse-Click (or Ctrl+Click on Mac) on any of the translated text and vote on the translations provided by others. Or Right-Mouse-Click on the non translated text and submit your own translations! It is that easy. Anyone viewing the page in that language will immediately see your contributions and will be very grateful to you!\n\nThe more you translate, the higher your rank will become. Keep translating, you may even see rewards coming your way from us...!!! ;)\n\nNOTICE:  Please DO NOT ACTIVATE this extension if you are logged into a private site or anywhere where you could compromise personal information. Since all of the content is verified with TranslationExchange service, your private information can potentially be compromised by being sent over the wire. So only use it on public pages.\n\nThank you very much for participating in this project! We really appreciate any and all contributions from you!"
