Instead of looking early for the high rated ones, or if you just want to save time instead of going tab to tab, this extension is for you. This extension will inject the professors ratings from RateMyProfessor straight into the registration table(s) for you!!\n\nDisclosure: I am using a 3rd party api to get the ratings for you, so if something breaks rip. I'll try to fix it asap. This only works for BYUI students and for OUR registration portal. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out via email @ sebastiancdunn@gmail.com\nAlso the icon is from the school's website, I didn't take that picture. Credits go to them!"
