First you upload your resume, then re-type your resume into the application, only for your resume to never land in front of a real person.\n\nThis means you need to write your resume for both automated systems and for real humans.\n\nWith the OneClickResume extension, you can use your resume to auto-fill job applications with the press of a button.  It supports .pdf, .doc, and .docx files.\n\nWe also take the guesswork out of crafting a resume that can be read by automated applicant tracking systems.  You can upload your resume and see all the information that can be read from it, letting you know how well your resume is written for those automated systems.\n\n——————\n\n★Key Features★\n\n1. Auto-fill job applications using your resume with a click of a single button.\n\n2. Upload your resume and have it read by and automated system to see how your resume is being read and understood by applicant tracking systems."
