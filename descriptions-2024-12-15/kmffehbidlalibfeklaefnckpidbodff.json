To maintain alignment with Google's updated requirements, this transition is essential as iboss continues to uphold the highest industry standards and best practices. To avoid potential disruptions, it is strongly recommended to transition to the 'iboss Cloud Connector' extension as soon as possible.\n\nThe iboss Cloud Connector for Chromebooks is used to connect enterprise-owned Chromebooks to the iboss Zero Trust SSE to extend all cloud security capabilities across Chromebook devices. Cloud Connectors connect devices from any location and ensure traffic is always steered through the iboss Zero Trust SSE where security is applied, and logging is generated for visibility. This extension redirects traffic on Chromebooks. The Google Workspace management console must be used to deploy both the Compatibility App and the Chromebook Connector at the same time. \n\niboss is a cloud security company that enables organizations to reduce cyber risk by delivering a Zero Trust Security Service Edge platform designed to protect resources and users in the modern distributed world. The iboss platform replaces legacy VPN, Proxies, and VDI with a consolidated service that improves security, increases the end-user experience, consolidates technology, and substantially reduces costs. Built on a containerized cloud architecture, iboss delivers security capabilities such as SWG, malware defense, Browser Isolation, CASB, and Data Loss Prevention to protect all resources via the cloud instantaneously and at scale. The iboss platform includes ZTNA to replace legacy VPN, Security Service Edge to replace legacy Proxies, and Browser Isolation to replace legacy VDI. This shifts the focus from protecting buildings to protecting people and resources wherever they are located. To learn more, visit https://www.iboss.com"
