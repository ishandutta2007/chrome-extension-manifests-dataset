Whose face do you want to see?\n\nThe links to articles will still work, so if you want to see the actual picture you can click through. This extension only changes photos linked to news articles in your Facebook News feed. You can still see silly orange faces on news sites if you want to. If you go to a news site, you should expect it. No one wants that in their Fb feed.\n\nCashew vs Trump. You decide."
