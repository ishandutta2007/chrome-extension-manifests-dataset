Just install the plugin, navigate to the Spotify web player, and at the top of the screen you will see the logo for this extension and a few basic settings (on/off, notifications on/off, etc). While the box is checked, the next song will be triggered every 60 seconds (with a short notification) and a counter will keep track of your progress.  If you want to disable the sound effect between songs, just click the bell icon to turn them off.  You can also use the slider to adjust the volume of the sound effect between songs."
