At the same time, it preserves the list positions of all the messages, so that they continue drifting down as they age.\n\n\n-- CONFIGURATION --\n\nHyped News Amplifier configuration is dead simple. It only needs a number to do its magic. By default the number is set to 50%, meaning that points and comments weigh the same. Open the Options page and customize that number. For example, if you set it to 10% points and 90% comments, then comments will count 9 times more than points.\n\n\n-- CHANGE LOG --\n\n1.9.0\n+ Fixed Reddit support\n+ Introduced the _Stars_ mode\n+ Simplified the _Options_ page"
