But it can also be a distraction.  While it's easy to block all of YouTube, or to block much objectionable content using YouTube restricted mode, it would be nice to be able to restrict the set of videos that can be viewed to a small set, rather than the entirety (or near entirety) of YouTube.\n\nVideo Safelist allows an administrator to define a set of YouTube videos that are permitted for viewing.\n\nWhen the extension operates in an unlocked mode, any YouTube video can be added to the list, or a previously added video can be removed.  The list of videos can be exported to a CSV file, and then later imported to the same or a different computer using the extension.  When in locked mode, only those videos that have previously been approved are available for viewing.  Any other videos are blocked when the user attempts to view them.  A password is required to return to unlocked mode.\n\nVideos can be added by clicking the Add video to safelist button or, for faster adding, the shortcut keys of Ctrl+Shift+A may be used."
