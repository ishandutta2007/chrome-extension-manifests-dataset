Link management is facilitated through GitOps.\n\nThe code is primarily generated by GPT with minimal style adjustments by human. The concept and architecture, however, originate from human ingenuity.\n\nThe link configuration files can be placed anywhere accessible via URL from the browser. An illustrative configuration is available at `https://github.com/bytebase/goa/raw/main/data.json`. These configurations can be stored in public or private repositories, or essentially in any location.\n\nGitOps is employed by teams or enterprise users to oversee Goa links. For instance, the addition of a new link requires code reviews, as demonstrated in `https://github.com/bytebase/goa/pull/1`."
