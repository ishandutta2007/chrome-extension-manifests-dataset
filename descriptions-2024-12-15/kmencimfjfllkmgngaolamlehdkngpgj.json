Additionally, player highlights are available at the bottom of the Team Roster page - now you don't have to waste time searching Google/Reddit/MLB for streams and highlights of your team, just one click and you're good!\n\nGitHub URL: https://github.com/Dadamsmeade/Fantrax-Baseball-Live-Feed-Highlights\n\nCHANGELOG:\n1.1: Changed Washington Nationals abbreviation from \"WAS\" to \"WSH\"\n1.2: Updated URL change for foodexsport streaming service used for declutter.js\n1.3: Updated content.js, page format changed and broke my code so needed to update\n1.4: Updated URL string for Arizona Diamondbacks from \"diamondbacks\" to \"d-backs\"\n1.5: Added MLB Gameday icon next to video stream icon that links to the MLB Gameday page for each player's team\n1.5.1: Bug fix for the Live Scoring page, icons weren't showing up on the Period setting\n1.5.2: Video streaming URL changed from foodexsports.com to volokit.com, updated code to recognize that\n1.5.3: Video streaming URL changed from volokit.com/mlb-games/* to volokit.com/volostream/mlb-games/*\n2.0: Updated declutter.js, content.js, page formats changed so needed to update.
