This way, you can enjoy a cleaner, more relevant comment section without the distraction of spam.\n\nWe don't collect any data, and our extension runs on a simple algorithm, ensuring it won't put any extra load on your computer.\n\nFeatures:\n✓  Hide comments from Twitter verified accounts (blue checkmarks).\n✓  Improve your browsing experience by filtering out spam and irrelevant content.\n✓  Lightweight and easy to use."
