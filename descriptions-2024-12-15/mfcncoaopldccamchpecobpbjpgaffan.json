You need to right click inside the login window and click \"Inspect\" so the redirect works correctly. \n\nThe issue above should be fixed in v0.2.5, but follow the instructions if it happens since it's a problem with Reddit itself.\n\nFeatures:\n* Filter subreddits by writing on the search bar\n* Filter subreddits with /r and subreddit name\n* Filter multis with /m and multi name\n* Sort subreddits by name ascending or descending\n* Open subreddit on the current page with double click or Enter key\n* Hold Shift, Alt or Win/Command key while opening to open the subreddit in a new tab\n\nIcon provided by IconPacks.net (https://www.iconpacks.net/free-icon/semicolon-13254.html)"
