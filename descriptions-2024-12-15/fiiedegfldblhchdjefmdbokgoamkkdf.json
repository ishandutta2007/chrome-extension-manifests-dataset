Here are the key details:\n\n1. Objective: The goal is to form a line of three of your own symbols (either \"X\" or \"O\") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n2. Gameplay:\n    - Players take turns placing their symbol (\"X\" or \"O\") in an empty cell.\n    - The first player to achieve three of their symbols in a row wins.\n    - If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.\n\n3. Starting Player:\n    - Typically, \"X\" goes first, but you can decide randomly or alternate.\n\n4. Strategy:\n    - To win, players need to create a winning pattern while blocking their opponent.\n    - Corners and the center cell are strategic starting positions.\n\n5. Example Board:\n    ```\n    1 | 2 | 3\n    ---------\n    4 | 5 | 6\n    ---------\n    7 | 8 | 9\n    ```\n\n6. Sample Moves:\n    - Player 1 (X) places their symbol in cell 5.\n    - Player 2 (O) places their symbol in cell 3.\n    - The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.\n\nRemember, Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging game that requires both strategy and foresight. Enjoy playing! ðŸ˜Š\n\n![Tic Tac Toe](^i^)"
