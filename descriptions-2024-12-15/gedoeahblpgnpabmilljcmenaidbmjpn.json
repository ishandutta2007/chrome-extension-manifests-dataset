We often lose interest quickly and don't read the part of the article that matters. Crammer is a Chrome extension tool that uses Artificial Intelligence to analyse and find the key phrases of an article you are reading online. It then shows you the locations of key phrases you select so you can quickly find what you are looking for. ‚ö°\n\nThink of it as a way of having a contents or glossary for a web page. üîé\n\nA popup appears over the web page once the text analytics has completed. The great part is that this popup is fully re-sizable and can be dragged anywhere when clicking on the 'Key Phrases' title. If it is getting in the way at all, there is a toggle switch button to hide and show the popup window.\n\nBONUS #1 üéÅ: Able to perform analysis in 7 languages üåç and many more languages are on the way!\n\nBONUS #2 üéÅ: Now shows a badge for each phrase displaying how many times it is mentioned on the web page!"
