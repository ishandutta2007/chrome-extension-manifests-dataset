For more information (or to help fix this), read the issue: https://github.com/kfahy/slack-disable-wysiwyg-bookmarklet/issues/27.\n\nDisables Slack's new wysiwyg text editor. \n\nSlack used to have the ability to use markdown in their text. They changed this permanently for all users without the ability to go back. Per Arthur O’Dwyer on his blog entry that was posted on Hacker News (https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/11/20/slack-rich-text-box/, 2019-11-20):\n\n>>> Slack has just recently rolled out a “WYSIWYG text input” widget to its Web browser interface. (Apparently, the phased rollout started at the beginning of November 2019, but it’s just now starting to hit the workspaces that I participate in.) The user experience of using this new input method is really, really, really bad.\n\nKevin Fahy created a short script that allows users to disable the new wysiwyg editor (https://github.com/kfahy/slack-disable-wysiwyg-bookmarklet).\nThis extension is adapted from that script: Github: https://github.com/pocc/no-wysiwyg. To see it in action, look at the screenshot.\n\nInspired by the Hacker News articles: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21589647, https://github.com/kfahy/slack-disable-wysiwyg-bookmarklet"
