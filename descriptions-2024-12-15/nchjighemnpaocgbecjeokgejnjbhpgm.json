And soon we're faced with 20+ small tabs sticking to each other. It‚Äôs a real nightmare to find the tab you need. \n\nMost of the time we end up going back on google and typing the exact same key words that we typed before or having to go through the whole browser history.\n\nThat‚Äôs why we developed TaBoard. \n\nTaboard is a chrome extension that can not only save one tab but can also save all the tabs open in your browser in one click. In one click you can save all your tabs, close your browser and find all those tabs back the next morning. TaBoard enables you to have access to a webapp to organize your tabs in folders. But also, most of the time, we work with other people. With TaBoard, you can share your folder with all the relevant links to someone else and easily collaborate on a project.\n\nTaBoard enables you organise your workspace, save your time and clear your mind!"
