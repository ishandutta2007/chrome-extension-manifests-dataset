And if you're like me, you care about privacy. I wrote this extension to clean up my digital footprint. Unlike other extensions, which only hide the messages from the user's inbox, Shoot the Messenger will remove messages from the RECEIVER'S inbox as well.\n\nIt's simple: you open a messenger thread on a desktop, press 'remove messages', and go get a coffee. While you're gone, the extension will scroll up through your messenger thread and automatically unsend every message. Unsending a message means that anyone in the thread will see 'X has unsent a message' instead of the original text of the message.\n\nTechnical details: this extension doesn't send any information to any servers, or try to reverse-engineer Facebook's messenger API. Instead, it simply simulates mouse clicks on the UI as if a user was pressing buttons. \n\nThe code can be found here: https://github.com/theahura/shoot-the-messenger/\nI'll be posting updates on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theahura_"
