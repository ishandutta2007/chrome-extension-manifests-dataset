I made this handy plugin:\n\n+ Remove ads & sponsored products\n+ Dark mode\n+ Distraction-free mode\n+ De-cluttered, modern UI\n+ High-quality product images\n\nThe Amazon store sells nearly everything these days. But it's also full of ads and sponsored products. And its design is showing its age. This powerful, lightweight plugin brings the Everything Store into the 21st century. Brought to you by a design industry veteran and obsessive Amazon shopper who knows the site inside and out.\n\n\nTRY A FREE DEMO\n==\nWhy not try it right now, for FREE, on Amazon search pages? Hit \"Add to Chrome\" then head over to Amazon.com and search for something. Looks amazing, right? Buh-bye ads! So long clutter!\n\n\nUNLOCK THE FULL GLOWUP\n==\nOpen the Amazon GlowUp extension menu or head over to AmazonGlowup.com to unlock the full glowup for all Amazon pages. You get a major glowup AND you get to help support indie developers like me trying to SAVE THE WORLD through good design. \n\nI think you'll love it so much you'll never want to go back to the old Amazon!\n\n\nCOUNTRY SUPPORT\n==\nAmazon GlowUp works in most Amazon stores. Right-to-left language countries not supported. For a full list of supported Amazon stores, visit https://amazonglowup.com."
