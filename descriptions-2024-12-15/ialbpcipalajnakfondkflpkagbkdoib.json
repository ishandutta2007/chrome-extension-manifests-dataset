However, the original repository is often not updated to let new-comers see that. I have many times wasted effort on making a pull-request or installing old buggy versions of projects when the community had already moved to a fork.\n\nTo make matters worse, the old projects usually have higher search-engine traffic and a lot more stars than the forks. This makes the forks even harder to find. This extension tries to remedy that by adding a subscript under the name of the repository on the Github page of all projects with a link to the most notable fork (i.e. the fork with the most stars), if such a fork exists."
