This extension is particularly useful for a wide range of activities such as long reading sessions, overnight downloads, extensive data analysis, or even uninterrupted streaming of media. By preventing your system from entering sleep mode and your display from powering down, it ensures that your work or entertainment isn’t disrupted. The extension is a perfect tool for professionals and students who require their systems to remain active for prolonged periods, as well as for casual users who enjoy seamless media consumption without the annoyance of their system going into standby mode.\n\nThe user interface of Keep Awake your System or Display is designed for simplicity and ease of use. With just a click, users can toggle the extension to keep their system awake, allowing them to focus on their tasks without the need to constantly interact with their device to prevent it from sleeping. This feature is especially beneficial during tasks that require minimal user interaction but need the system to stay active, like large file downloads, long video uploads, or even during remote access scenarios. The extension’s unobtrusive design means it runs quietly in the background, offering a seamless experience without cluttering the desktop or interfering with other applications.\n\nIn addition to its primary function, Keep Awake your System or Display offers customization options to suit various user needs. Users can choose between modes that solely keep the display active, solely prevent the system from sleeping, or both, providing flexibility for different use cases. This adaptability makes the extension suitable not only for individual users but also for a corporate environment where different users might have varying requirements. Whether in a professional setting, an educational institution, or for personal use, Keep Awake your System or Display is an indispensable tool that enhances productivity and convenience."
