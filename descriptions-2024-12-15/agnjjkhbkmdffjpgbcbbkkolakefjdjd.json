I created a Chrome extension to simplify this process for you. With this extension, you can open the current URL in a new tab, replacing only the host URL while keeping the rest of the path intact.\n\nWhen is this helpful?\nThis extension is particularly useful when you're working on localhost and need to open the exact same URL in another environment, such as a staging or production server.\n\nHow it works:\n* Add an Environment: Specify the environment name and URL.\n* Open a Website: Navigate to any website.\n* Use the Extension: Click on the Open Environment Extension, and a new tab will open with the host URL replaced, keeping the rest of the path unchanged.\n\nThis tool streamlines your workflow, making it easy to switch between different environments without manually editing the URL."
