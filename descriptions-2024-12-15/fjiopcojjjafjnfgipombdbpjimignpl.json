It then parses through a web page's job description with the click of a button and provides a general summary that includes a similarity score, keyword comparisons, and suggestions. The parsed resume persists through multiple clicks, so there is no need to upload a new resume every time one wants to compare their resume to a job description. While the extension is geared towards helping job-seekers, it is also useful for recruiters who are curious about an applicant's resume's fit."
