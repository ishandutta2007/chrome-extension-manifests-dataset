It's simple and quick to install, but incredibly powerful in helping you learn to play, easier and faster.\n\nHere's why...\n\nYou can effortlessly create small looped segments of any tutorial videos, so you can watch and practice the same small segment of teaching, over and over again.\n\nThis means you never get overwhelmed, as you can break every lesson into bite-sized chunks that suit your learning skills. Learning this way makes it easier to play more ambitious material, than you previously thought possible!\n\nYou can slow your loops down, so you can learn at a pace that's comfortable for you - and then, when you're ready, slowly increase the speed as you get better.\n\nThis gives you the power to continually adjust the learning speed to suit you, which builds your skills and confidence faster - and it's so much more fun.\n\nYou can save your looped video segments, so you can instantly find them and go back to them the next day, week, or month, til you've completely nailed that song, riff or solo you've always wanted to master.\n\nWith LOOPi you've got COMPLETE CONTROL, so you can learn at your pace, in your time, whenever and however you like."
