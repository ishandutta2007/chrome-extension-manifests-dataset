New interface created for creating your SpeedNav Urls\n\nSpeedNav is a plugin created for testers who navigate within the same domain alot. If makes a context menu (right click menu) in chrome that shows you links that you save for the domain that you are on. \n\nEx. \nLets say that you are testing an eCommerce website and you constantly look at different scenarios of listing pages and detail pages etc. Instead of navigating or looking through all your bookmarks you will have all the shortcuts literally at your fingertips drastically reducing valuable time looking for 'that link I saved somewhere'\n\nYou can even ',' comma separate you domains so the url will show up on multiple websites. You can configure your shortcut to be a global link as well so it shows up on all websites. You can even setup a link to opn in a new tab.\n\nNote! Because of security reasons from google the plugin will not work on google webstore.\n\nEnjoy!!!"
