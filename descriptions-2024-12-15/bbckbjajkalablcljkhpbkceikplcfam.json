Once ChatGPT is set as your default search engine, you can search directly from your browser's URL bar.\n\nChatGPT can now search the web in a much better way than before. You can get fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources that you would have had to go to a search engine for before. This combines the benefits of a natural language interface with the value of up-to-date sports scores, news, stock quotes, and more. Chats also now include links to sources, such as news articles and blog posts, so you can learn more.\n\nTo redirect a query to Google Search, type \"!g [your query]\" (for example, !g foobar) directly into your browser's URL bar."
