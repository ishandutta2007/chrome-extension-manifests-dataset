This Chrome Extension lets you bookmark repositories in a sidebar injected only on GitHub.com pages. The sidebar will let you navigate faster and give you better control over your most used repositories. \n\nFeatures\n\n- Easy to bookmark and navigate repositories\n- Overview over active Pull requests or Issues for your repos\n- Periodically checks for new or updated items\n- Optional to show badge in GitHub favicon if new items\n- Works across multiple tabs\n- Color coding of items based on status (Approved, Changes Requested)\n\nSettings\n- Repositories\n\nSimply navigate to any Github repository you would like to add a shortcut to and press the button for *Add current repository*.\n\nYou can sort the order of repositories by simply drag&drop.\n\n- Access Token\n\nFor all features of this extension to work, you will need to provide an access token from Github. This is not a requirement, but it will make the extension load data about issues and pull requests from your repositories. Please create an access token here https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Github%20sidebar%20browser%20extension to allow this extension to fetch necessary data from Github. The necessary scopes for the token is already selected if you follow the link above. All you need is to press \"Generate Token\", and copy/paste the token into the extension.\n\nNote: The token is only saved to your browsers local *chrome.storage.local* and only used to communicate with Githubs API.\n\n- Other settings\nShould (hopefully) be pretty self-explanatory"
