A small icon will pop up in the toolbar - click that and you can probably work out the rest :)\n\nFeatures:\n* (NEW!) Fetches semester start/end dates automagically from the Unimelb academic calendar\n* Scrapes all timetable data (subject code+name, times, location)\n* Repeats timetable for duration of semester\n* Excludes repeats from the mid-semester break\n* Ability to include week-long events that are labelled with the University week # (plus one for the mid-semester break)\n\nPlease report any bugs on my GitHub repo: https://github.com/nuclearpidgeon/UoM-Timetable-to-iCal\n\nVersion history:\n* v1.2.0 (August 2019) - update the semester break date for semester 1 2019, and add an automatic semester selection (based on which one starts closest to the current date)\n* v1.1.5 (February 2018) - update the semester break date for semester 1 2018\n* v1.1.4 (August 2017) - fix date fetching issues with the new Unimelb calendar page (worst 'API' ever!)"
