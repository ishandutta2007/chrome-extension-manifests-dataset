Hey, me too! That's why I created this extension, to freshen up the default page and add some beautiful scenery and words. \n\n'But what about links to my most visited sites? I can't be without that!'\nNo worries! I got you covered, fam. In the upper left corner of the page there is an eye icon, if you click on it a list will appear with your most visited sites so that you can quickly get access to your favorite websites. Nifty, huh?\n\n\nIf you rather prefer having inspirational quotes shown on your new tab I got you covered aswell. Quotes New Tab is my first new tabs extension featuring motivational quotes from famous people.
