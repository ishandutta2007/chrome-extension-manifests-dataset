These tabs bring you just a little closer by displaying unique high quality campus pictures everyday. Staying at home does not mean that students should miss out on the beautiful campus (we are paying full tuition after all). \n\nThe extension also has plenty of built in features. Customize your main focus every day to stay on track, even at home. Organize your day with the built-in to-do list. Even get live weather updates from your area.\n\nHave any pictures that you would like to share with the UT Sights users? Email them to suket.shah@utexas.edu to have them featured on UT Sights. Also make sure to send your instagram and/or facebook so that we can give you a shoutout for your picture. \n\nHook 'em and stay safe!"
