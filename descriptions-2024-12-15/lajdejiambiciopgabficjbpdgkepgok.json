This extension is needed in the QA and design process of experiences set-up inside Convert Experiences and part of the visual editor. On it’s installation it will request two permissions \"Read your browsing history\" and \"Communicate with cooperating websites\" this allows the connection between the application and the Chrome extension, you can read more about these settings and their role here: https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/204506699-Chrome-Debugger-Extension-For-Convert-Experiences. Once activated the Chrome's Console offers a live-log with real-time information about the experiences running on the website. Whitelisting the domains and subdomains you are working on allows you to have a smoother experience in the applications editor since we assist with settings in iframe, x-header and SameSite cookies.\n\nFor more information\nhttps://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/204506699-Chrome-Debugger-Extension-For-Convert-Experiences\n\nInside the Chrome Extension of Convert Experiences we have some powerful tools to help you make use of the Visual Editor and debug the experiences in the Chrome console. Features we offer as part of the installation are:\nX-frame-security-header-options removed allow you to see more sites in the the visual editor\nChrome SameSite strict cookies are modified for the white-listed sites so you can see iframes and other part of your website better in the Visual Editor\n\nYou can see we ask for two specific settings on the install of the extension:\n\n\"Read your browsing history\"\nThis permission is required to get the domain name of the page you're visiting when and checks if you have this whitelisted and it’s connected to the Convert Experiences application. Please, note the extension only reads the content that is directly required to run the features described only.\n\n\"Communicate with cooperating websites\"\nThis permission is required for communication with Convert Experiences application. We use it to know if you have installed the extension or not, see if you have the extension on or off and see if you have the domains white-listed that you are working on in the Visual Editor. This then allows us to make the visual editor more workable and in case it’s missing settings show messages on how to improve the Chrome Extension settings. \n\nIf you would prefer to restrict the access of the Convert Experiences Chrome extensions to only those whitelisted sites. We can imagine you might want to add the Site Access option to “On specific sites” then please add all domains and subdomains to that area manually (see settings in the below image)."
