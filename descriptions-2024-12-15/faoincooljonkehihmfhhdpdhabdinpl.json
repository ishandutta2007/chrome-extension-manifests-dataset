The extension's badge keeps count of the number of comments it has removed on that tab. There's nothing to configure. Just install it and it gets to work removing all the comments that make that vein in your forehead twitch.\n\nEnjoying this extension? Please leave a review! It helps others discover it (and feeds my ego a little, thanks üôè). If you're feeling generous, please consider supporting me with a small tip. Not required, but always very appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è https://buymeacoffee.com/sidewindern7\n\nPS. A quick disclaimer: while I have done my best to cover most variations of the way people write the \"who's listening\" comments, this extension isn't perfect. If you spot a comment that you feel should have been removed - drop me a line. Feedback and bug reports are welcome. The easiest way to get in touch with me is via reddit (https://reddit.com/u/SidewinderN7) or Discord (@sidewindern7)."
