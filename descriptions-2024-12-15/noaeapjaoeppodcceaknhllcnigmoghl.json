On April 1st, Legacy Verified accounts will lose their verified status. This means that users with a checkmark are guaranteed to not be notable figures and instead have just paid for Twitter Blue.\n2. On April 15th, The For You page will no longer(?) display non-verified tweets. This effectively makes the entire platform pay to win as you must pay to grow your following.\n\nAlso, it was mentioned somewhere that users who have Twitter Blue will rank higher than users without it.\n\nI plan to fix this by effectively removing all users who pay for Twitter Blue via extensions.\n\nThread on Twitter: https://twitter.com/frostyfrog2/status/1640544747696824322\nThread on the Fediverse: https://vtubers.site/notice/AU3pZUM09Uel6lOKQq"
