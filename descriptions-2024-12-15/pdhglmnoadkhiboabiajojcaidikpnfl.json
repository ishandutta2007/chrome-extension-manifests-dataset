The Comment Cleaner for Facebook™ allows users to cleanse their newsfeed by hiding comments which primarily contain tagged friends, links, or contain few words. This makes funny/interesting/useful comments easier to identify, especially in comment sections where sorting by relevance is not an option.\n\nThe \"cleaning\" process may be accomplished in the following ways.\n\nAutomatic cleaning: \nWhen enabled, comments are cleaned according to settings on page load, and any new comments loaded afterwards are automatically targeted and removed.\n\nManual cleaning: \nUsers may use buttons in the menu or hotkeys (alt+x, alt+z or option-x, option-z for Mac) to clean comments or restore previously cleaned comments according to settings. This manual option may be used with or without automatic cleaning enabled.\n\nCleaning preferences will be saved and remembered for whenever facebook.com™ is loaded. The icon and theme will turn red to indicate that automatic cleaning is enabled.\n\n\n\nFacebook™ is a trademark of Facebook Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.
