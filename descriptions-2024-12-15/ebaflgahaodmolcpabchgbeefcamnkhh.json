It doubles as a universal shopping cart and wish list enabling cross site product tracking. Whether you are just browsing or actively looking to buy, shopping will be made easy, smart, and organized. \n\nHow it works: \n\nGo to the product page of any supported retailer. Click Add Item and the item will be added to Budget Cart. \n\nUpdate Budget will enable the user to update their budget. \n\nThe Buy All button will open every item in the cart in a new tab and will recalculate the user's budget.  \n\nCurrently supported retailers: Amazon, Urban Outfitters, Zara, PacSun, Macy's, Nordstrom, Nike, and many more to come! \n\nNote: Budget Cart is not able to calculate tax prices at the current moment."
