This functionality can be particularly useful for individuals looking to reduce visual distractions, increase accessibility, or simply prefer a more minimalist, black-and-white browsing experience.\n\nThis extension is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with your browser. With just one click, you can switch the entire webpage between full colour and grayscale, making it as simple as possible to customize your viewing experience according to your preferences.\n\n## Features\n\n* **One-Click Toggle:** Switch between colour and grayscale modes instantly with just one click.\n* **Universal Compatibility:** Works on any webpage, providing a consistent and reliable experience.\n* **Minimalist Design:** Simple and unobtrusive, the Mode Switcher blends into your browser without disrupting your workflow.\n* **Free and Open Source:** The Mode Switcher is completely free to use and its source code is available for anyone to inspect or modify.\n\n## Important Note\n\nPlease note that this extension operates on a per-tab basis. This means that changes made to a webpage will only persist for the duration of the session. If the webpage is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened, the webpage will revert back to its original colours. This design is intentional, as it allows for a non-permanent, easily reversible customization of your browsing experience.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store.\n2. Navigate to a webpage of your choice.\n3. Click on the Mode Switcher icon in your browser's toolbar to switch between colour and grayscale modes.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using the Mode Switcher Chrome extension and find it helpful in customizing your browsing experience!\n\n## Author \n\nHarshad Joshi @ Bufferstack.IO Analytics Technology LLP"
