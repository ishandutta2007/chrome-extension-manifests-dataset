It also shows the final percent of each course.\n\nOn each class page the extension offers the ability to predict hypothetical grades using category weighting and assignment weighting, allowing you to edit your grades to see your new final percent/grade. You can also see all the possible final percents/grades you can get from a single assignment. This feature has a tour that fully explains how it works in detail.\n\nRefer to the project README on the repository for more details.\n\nBecause v2 has just been released, many new features are on the way.
