These are not captions, it's just the transcript which has been written by the uploader of the video.\n\nIf you found a site where this extension isn't working, please check the following:\n- Is the video you're trying to find the transcript of a Wistia video? Wistia videos usually allow you to right-click them and have an option 'About Wistia'.\n- If you're more technical, try to find the transcript yourself by:\n1. Inspect the webpage (Inspect Element)\n2. Press Ctrl + F and type \"transcript\", then press Enter\n3. Among the search results there should be a script element that embeds the video. The JSON of the script element should have a \"transcript\" key if there is one for that video."
