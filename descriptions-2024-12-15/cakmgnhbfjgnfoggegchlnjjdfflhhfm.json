It simply adds another section to the \"read more\" part of any youtube video with direct links to the songs. \n\nThings to note: It's not going to be 100% accurate, so links may be wrong, or it may not display a song that is actually available. When in doubt, manually search your favorite services.\n\nrdio seems to return something no matter how absurd, so it's likely there will be an rdio link for videos that aren't music. This will be fixed in the future."
