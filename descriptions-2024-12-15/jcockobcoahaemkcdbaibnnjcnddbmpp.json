His goal is to visit every webpage in the world. If you happen to find him, click on him and he will wander off to another spot on the page you're viewing.\n\nWhere's Waldorf is a simple extension that adds Waldorf to every page you visit. He will randomly be placed on the page. If you find him, just click on him. You will the receive a popup telling you how long it took you to find him.\n\nIf Waldorf is ever annoying, you can turn him off using the toolbar icon. When you hide Waldorf, he will leave. If you decide you miss him and you want him back, just click the button again to bring him back.\n\nGood Luck!"
