It helps you to have a different and complex password for every account you own while only remembering one (or multiple) passwords !\n\nTo have a high level of security, all information is stored encrypted (salt + AES 256-CBC). Nothing is stored on client. The decryption is done on the fly when it's needed and only with user input. So, a hacker can get your password database, it will not be able to see any information (except if it brute force or leak your masterkey) ! Thus it's important to choose a strong masterkey !\n\n\nUsage\n\nFirst thing is configuration :\n1) Enable the extension for private browsing\n2) Install your server (see below), or use the demonstration one and create your accout\n2) Go to extension options and configure your server address (\"https://server name/account\")\n3) Populate your password database. You can use \"*\" character to access to all subdomains of a specific website (ie *.google.com).\n\nThen usage :\nWhen you're in a login form and you want to use gPass, type your login (case sensitive !) and fill \"@@masterkey\" in password field (only if gPass icon is green !). Then submit and password will automatically be replaced by the one in the database (after addon decrypt it).\n\n**You can also type \"@_masterkey\" to only replace your password without automatic submit. This allows to support more websites.**\n\nAnother option is to enter your credentials in the new popup menu by clicking on gPass icon. If it's possible, gPass will auto fill password field, if not result password is stored into your clipboard. **Popup path is a safest method as website page will never see your masterkey.**\n\n** Warning ** : Sometimes, addon could make some websites unusable, especially for login form. In this case, you can deactivate it for only one website by clicking right on gPass icon and \"disable or enable gPass for this website\" in addon menu. It's a local configuration, so it must be done for each browser. gPass can also be disabled for ALL websites thanks to addon menu \"Disable or enable gPass for ALL websites\". _When gPass is disabled, you can still use popup feature_.\n\n\nServer\n\nTo host a password server, you need a webserver. Just copy server files in a directory read/write for web server user (www-data). A sample apache2 configuration file is available in resources. Since v0.8 and the use of Crypto API, **it's manadatory to have an HTTPS access (valid SSL/TLS certificate) to the server**. Without that, the decryption will fails.\n\nConfiguration parameters are in conf.php\n\nA demonstration server is available [here](https://gpass-demo.soutade.fr). It's the default server configuration for fresh installed addon (user demo).\n\n**Warning** The master key derivation is partially based on account URL. So it's linked to your current server information. You can't move databases from servers with different URLs, you need to export them and import it again.\n\n**Server side is available [here](http://indefero.soutade.fr/p/gpass/downloads)**\n\n\nClient\n\nJust install the package. You can have debug information by setting DEBUG in main.js.\n\n\nLicense\n\nAll the code is licensed under GPL v3.
