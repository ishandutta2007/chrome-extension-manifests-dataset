Or simply make notes from Wikipedia by copying different lines in different paragraphs? Instead of copying and pasting each line or selection individually, this tool lets you make different selections that you need on the web page and copy it all together and paste it where you want in a single go. You can use this tool to select relevant portions on a page and copy them as you read without having to switch tabs and paste it somewhere for each selection you make. This helps you save time not only in switching tabs but also giving you the ability to copy as you read without breaking your concentration. \n\nUsage Instructions\nOnce the extension is active, it offers you the following features.\n\nCopying text\nSelect whatever text you want to copy. Hit the Shift button on your keyboard and the text will be added to a virtual clipboard. Select more text you want to copy and with each selection hit the Shift key to copy the selection. Once you're done copying all the text you need, hit the 'c' key on your keyboard and all the selected text will now be copied to your system clipboard. You can paste it anywhere you like.\n\nRemoving a selection\nHolding the Ctrl key while pressing the Shift deletes the last selection from the virtual clipboard so that this will not be included in the final copied text.\n\nChoose the separator for pasting\nBefore you copy the text to the clipboard (ie before hitting the 'c' key on your keyboard), you can choose what separator you would like to use while pasting the various selections that you are about to copy. Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar and choose With new line to paste content separated by a newline between each copied selection. Choose With a white space to paste the selections separated by a white space. Click the OK button to confirm your choice. Default choice is newline.\n\nDisabling/Enabling the extension\nIn case the extension interrupts with other extensions or creates problems for you with the keyboard shortcuts, you can quickly disable its working by clicking on the extension icon and clicking on the Disable/Enable This Extension. The \"ON\" or \"OFF\" badge on the extension icon will denote the status of the extension. To enable it, simply repeat the same procedure."
