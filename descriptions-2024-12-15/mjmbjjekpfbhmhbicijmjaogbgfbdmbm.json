Plain and simple. If what you're looking for is an app without ads, that cares about privacy and simply fulfills the task of saving your personal notes while still having a clean and beautiful interface, Notepado is what you're looking for.\n\nWith Notepado you can create notes, save them, and read later, right from your new tab. They're in your browser at any moment, any time.\n\nNotes should contain just what they've been created for: pure text. With Notepado there is no rich text editor, no fancy menus, and no complex features. Simply click the big blue button and start to write. Once you've had enough, click the blue button again and your note is saved.\n\nNotepado also keeps the date of creation from your notes, letting you know how much time ago it was written.\n\nYou can also delete notes you no longer need. This can be achieved by clicking in the bottom right \"trash\" icon, and confirming the removal of the note. Be careful though, make sure you really don't need the note content anymore before removing it.\n\nThis is Notepado, an simple and beautiful app that lets you take notes as fast as possible, without bloating you with features no one uses or asking you for endless permissions on your browser.\n\nOne More Thing: We also have DarkMode. ;-)"
