You can create lists for different use cases and edit the names of the lists and listed extensions. \n\nThe next feature we added was the ability to append URLs. This is really helpful and saves time by taking a URL you are visiting and by clicking the extension and one of your saved sites you can open in a new tab and run the URL through a scan like a website page speed loading test as an example.\n\nSome use cases:\nAhrefs\nWayback Machine\nGoogle Page speed Insights\nand many more.\n\nThis extension was designed to keep your browser clean and organised and to save you time. Enjoy using the Batch Cache. We dont capture any personal information, we do bookmark your saved URL addresses to your account for quick reference as is the nature of this extension."
