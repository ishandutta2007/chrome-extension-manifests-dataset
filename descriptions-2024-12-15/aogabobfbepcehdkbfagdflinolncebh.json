We'd list them here and save you a click if we could; Google's extension review process randomly starts flagging Taco's extension, so we can't ðŸ˜ž\n\nâ€¢ FAST: Loads faster than Chrome's new tab page.\nâ€¢ PRIVATE: Can only access Taco's site, not your browsing history.\nâ€¢ PRODUCTIVE: Drag-and-drop all your tasks, tickets, starred emails/chats, and other work on one screen.\n\nDOESN'T REINVENT THE WHEEL: The world doesn't need yet another task tracker, and Taco has no way to create new tasks. Keep using the services you use today, but get more done.\n\nEXTENSION + WEB SITE + MOBILE: Not on your computer? Access your unified task list from any browser by visiting https://tacoapp.com. Taco's site is phone- and tablet-friendly, too.\n\nTHOUGHTFUL TOUCHES: Once you've chosen a few tasks or a project, have Taco hide everything else (http://blog.tacoapp.com/post/79976006070). As you make progress, edit the label to reflect the next action. When you're done, mark tasks complete without leaving Taco.\n\nMINIMAL: Taco only asks for the absolute minimum amount of access required to do its job. Taco's Chrome extension only asks for permission to change the new tab page and access to 2 Web sites: Taco's own site and Taco's image (CDN) site. Taco can't intercept your Web browsing.\n\n\nABOUT TACO\n\nTaco (https://tacoapp.com/) brings all of your existing tasks to one place. Taco's Chrome extension turns every new tab into an elegant way to see - and interactively prioritize - all of your existing tasks.\n\nDeciding what's most important? Just drag and drop. It's instant, effortless focus, right on your new tab page (or phone or tablet by using Taco's site directly). Hide the sidebar for even fewer distractions.\n\nThis extension retrieves tasks from TacoApp.com, which works with task lists, ticketing systems, email services, bug trackers, and other productivity services."
