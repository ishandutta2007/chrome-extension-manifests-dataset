Once installed and enabled, click on the chrome extension icon and select your team. You should begin to hear background crowd sounds mixed in with your team's chants. \n\nAlthough the app itself is non-commercial and the code open source, the chant audio was sourced from: https://www.fanchants.com/.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or feedback, raise a Github issue at https://github.com/roodrallec/footychant.\n\nThis app was created by Bj√∂rn Wahle & Jorge Nicolas Alexander"
