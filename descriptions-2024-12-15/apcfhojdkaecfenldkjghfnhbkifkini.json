Fuzzy search functionality also allows you to enter only part of a keyword, or only a subset of a kanji's components, and then browse the list of matching results to find the desired kanji. \n\nTo select a kanji character, navigate to it by pressing the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys, or by clicking on it's entry once. Press 'Enter' to insert the selected kanji into a field on a website at the current cursor position, or press 'Ctrl+c' to copy it into your clipboard. A double click on any entry, directly inserts the respective kanji into the input field.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+Space' to open the extension popup can be changed in Google Chrome's extension management tab."
