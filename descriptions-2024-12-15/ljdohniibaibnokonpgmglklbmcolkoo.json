This extension uses the URL Revealer API to grab the true destination for the URL right within your page without having to visit a separate decoder site.\n\nHOW TO USE:\n\n• Right-click on a URL on a web site and click the Decode this URL button.\n• A pop-up will appear on the page with the true destination URL which you can either copy / paste, click the \"Open in new tab\" button, or close by clicking the \"Close\" button or anywhere else on screen.\n\nSpecial thanks to urlrevealer.com for their open API; I am not affiliated with the site in any way but leverage their API for this extension. This is just a personal project – I wanted an extension like this to exist and couldn't find it in the Chrome Web Store. I will work to further improve the code and address any issues users flag in the Support section as time permits."
