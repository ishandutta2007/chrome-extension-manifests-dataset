Use the new design without seeing comment faces and spoiler tags as sad-looking links!\n\nVarious subreddits has allowed custom comment faces on the old Reddit design for ages. By typing a specific link format, such as [](#garlock), in a comment, the subreddit's stylesheet would turn that link into an image. New Reddit doesn't support community CSS, so comment faces can't be displayed there anymore - they either don't show up at all, or appear as broken links. This extension works around this limitation by applying the community's CSS to comment face links, rendering them usable again. It also works for various other old CSS hacks like named spoiler tags!\n\nFor release history, see the GitHub releases page: https://github.com/eritbh/new-reddit-comment-faces/releases"
