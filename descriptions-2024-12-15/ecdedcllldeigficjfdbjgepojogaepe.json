It acts as a tool to wean off your problem sites, where you can restrict access for a period of time that you choose, with the flexibility to choose the amount of time you think it's appropriate to spend on them.\n\nThe Procrastination Buster is not parental advisory software.\nThis is a product for people who want help in policing their own behavior, not in policing others'.\nYou can name up to 10 websites to restrict your usage.\nYou choose the amount of time you want to be allowed on your problem websites,\nand you choose the amount of time you Don't want to be allowed on the sites.\nIt's as simple as that.\n\nI built this extension for myself because I just got sick of spending so much extra time in my day on reddit. In the past I've allowed my internet usage habits to get the better of me. My habits would often get in the way of my productivity completing daily tasks, and especially when pursuing academics.\nNow that I'm learning how to code and trying to shift careers, I wanted to build this product as a test of my skills, with the added benefit of curbing my internet habits and honing my focus.\nI'm determined to make changes and be more successful in the future.\n\nIn building this product I've been able to help myself. If it's able to help you too, I'm overjoyed.\nGood luck to you in your future endeavors!\n-Tyler"
