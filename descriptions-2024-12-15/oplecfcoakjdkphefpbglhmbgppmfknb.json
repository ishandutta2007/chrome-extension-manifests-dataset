Sometimes, we make purchases based on emotions, societal pressures, or habits without fully considering the consequences. Recognizing and understanding these unrecognized intentions can help us make more informed and mindful purchasing decisions\nOnline shopping has become a part of our daily lives, and it's easy to get carried away with the convenience of it all. We wanted to create a tool that would help users make more mindful purchasing decisions, in the hopes of creating a world where we consume less and consume better.\n\nðŸš€ What it does\nIn a world filled with tempting offers and unconscious motivations, ShopiWise provides invaluable insights into the intentions driving your shopping choices, empowering you to make more mindful purchasing decisions.
