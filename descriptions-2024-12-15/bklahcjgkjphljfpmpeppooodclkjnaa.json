You can view coverage for the whole team, or just for your own testing.\n\nDO IT AGAIN\nWhen you're done, hit the RESET button to start a new round of test coverage analysis.\n\nIT'S PRIVATE\nHeadlamp records data anonymously, using only an ID number to represent each user. It records data such as the URLs that are visited, and the positions of elements on the page."
