It was frustrating because I would have to copy paste each name over and over again \n\nTo help this pain, I created this plugin which is super easy to use\n\nStep # 1: Install the plugin. You will see a red green yellow search icon in your browser\n\nStep # 2: Copy the name of the movie or tv show using the mouse \n\nStep # 3: Click on the Google search icon. This will open the movie/show details in a new window"
