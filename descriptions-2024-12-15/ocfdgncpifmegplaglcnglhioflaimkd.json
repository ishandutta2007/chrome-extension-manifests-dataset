Or what if you had to review that PR, don't line counts like that dissuade you from starting the review?\n\nIn reality, lots of code is generated nowadays and GitHub's line counts are not representative of a PR's true size.\n\nThis extension subtracts generated files from the total line counts, giving you a better idea of how big a PR really is. That's it. That's all it does.\n\nGenerated files are detected from the branch's root .gitattributes file. See GitHub's docs to learn how to mark a file as generated: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/customizing-how-changed-files-appear-on-github\n\nFor a simple example, checkout this extension's .gitattributes file! https://github.com/aklinker1/github-better-line-counts/blob/main/.gitattributes\n\n---\n\nThe extension is open source. Feel free to contribute if you have any ideas or just star it ðŸ˜€\nhttps://github.com/aklinker1/github-better-line-counts"
