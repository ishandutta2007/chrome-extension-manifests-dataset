There are usually a handful of sites whose results we prefer, and a handful of sites whose results are poor or worthless.\n\nSearch Filter allows you to specify (in developer-friendly fashion) sites whose results you would like see highlighted and sites whose results you never want to see.\n\nIn case you use multiple installations of Chrome, this extension allows you to sync your configuration across all installations.\n\nHere is a sample configuration:\n\n    # Make these domains stand out in results\n    +en.wikipedia.org\n    +stackoverflow.com \n    +github.com\n    +api.rubyonrails.org\n    # SPAM - never show these results\n    experts-exchange.com\n    # Pull filters from external source\n    @https://clobapi.herokuapp.com/default-filters.txt\n\nTo avoid littering the GUI with buttons, the Search Filter button only appears when running searches on Google."
