We are very happy you want to make it a more sustainable one with us. What you buy will shape the future of the clothing industry, so if we buy sustainable we will make a change for good. However it is not easy to find this information for all brands by yourself. It is very time consuming to manually rate all different brands, therefore we built an AI model. We apply scraping techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a website with an up-to-date sustainability label for almost all clothing brands.\n\nOur plugin indicates if a brand is sustainable or not by highlighting the brands in a clear way.\n\nThis project drives social change in the community. Not only by creating awareness, but also by providing a clear path to action. Knowing what brands are sustainable will make it easier for people to make the right choice, feel part of positive change and ultimately help reducing the impact of climate change. What we do today, can improve all our tomorrows."
