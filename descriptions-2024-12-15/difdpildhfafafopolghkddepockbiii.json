Unfortunately, due to colour blindness, many rugby fans find it difficult to even follow the match. That’s why we’ve developed See Green, a chrome extension to improve the viewing experience for all colour blind rugby fans.\n\nWhether you have trouble Seeing Green, or any colour, install See Green to ensure you can follow all the action in Japan.\n\nHow to set up See Green:\n\n•Select your colour blindness. Don't know it? That's fine. Just select the row with the faintest IRFU crests.\n•Then simply adjust the contrast slider to your liking.\n•If you need to, you can make further tweaks using the strength slider.\n•Click save and you're ready to follow all the action in Japan.\n\nHow See Green works:\n\n•Colours are first altered by using a colour matrix to simulate the relevant colour deficiency.\n•Colours are then compensated for colour vision deficiency by an additional colour matrix – this step shifts wavelengths away from the portion of the spectrum invisible to the colour deficiency, towards the visible portion.\n•The end result emulates that of Daltonisation. Daltonisation is a colour correction technique that attempts to adjust colours in such a way that there are less colour combinations that would be confusing to someone with colour vision deficiency."
