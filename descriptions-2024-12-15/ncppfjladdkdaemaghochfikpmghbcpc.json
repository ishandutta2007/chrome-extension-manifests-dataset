It adds a button to the toolbar, a context menu entry and a keyboard shortcut that allows you to move a tab to a new popup window.\n\nA popup window is a window without the navigation and the tab bar, so it will use much less vertical space. Because there is no toolbar visible inside a popup window, you need to use the context menu or the keyboard shortcut to move it back to a normal window if you want to. It will then try to attach it back to the window it earlier was detached from, and if this fails, for example because the window was meanwhile closed, it will attach it to the last focused window.\n\nUsage and settings explanation in detail at https://ht0.de/open-as-popup.html\nTo contact me, see https://ht0.de/about-contact.html"
