Features:\n\n  * Drag and Drop your characters to move them\n  * Pan the map with two fingers to move the viewport\n  * Pinch with two fingers to zoom in or out - this will only work correctly if you select \"Use Scroll to Zoom\" in \"My Settings\".\n  * Long-press to activate the right-click menu\n  * Enlarged the left-hand toolbar to make the icons easier to hit using the touch controls\n  * Full support for both fingers and styluses (pens)\n  * [New in 1.1.0] Touch also works in dialogs (i.e. Turn Order, Character sheets, ...) and the assets menu\n  * [New in 1.2.0] Hides the player names at the bottom of the viewport if the setting \"Player video/avatar size\" is set to \"Names only\" \n(to save space on smaller touchscreen devices)\n  * [New in 1.3.0] All modifier keys (CTRL, SHIFT, ALT, META) are now forwarded correctly and work as if you were using a mouse. Thus drawing circles is now possible!\n\nIf you play Pen & Paper or Tabletop games online, you probably know about Roll20 (https://roll20.net/). \nIt's a tremendous system for bringing players from all over the world to one table and going on an adventure. \n\nI was part of an online Pen & Paper roleplaying group. After three years of playing online, we decided to \ntake our game to the next level and meet up in real life. To be able to play our favorite game at a real table, we \nwanted to use my convertible laptop as a big touchscreen device in the center of the table. Unfortunately, Roll20 \ndoesn't support touch screens - neither with a stylus nor with bare fingers.\n\nBut fear not - Touch20 is here!\n\nIf you want to show your support for this extension in a financial manner, feel free to  visit the projectâ€™s GitHub page and donate via PayPal (not required at all though):\n\nhttps://github.com/Oromis/touch20"
