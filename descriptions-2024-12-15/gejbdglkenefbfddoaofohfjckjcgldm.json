Then this is the extension for you!! Choose what you want to filter out, and the extension censors the text on the page (You can view the uncensored text by hovering over the censored element with your mouse)!\n\nYou can choose the categories that are filtered:\n\n1. Adult Content\n2. Alcohol/Drugs\n3. Profanity\n4. Racist Content\n\nPrivacy:\n\nThe Content Filter does not track anything. It simply censors text in the webpage - that's all it does. No backdoors, no internet usage data sent to servers, none of that! In fact, one reason I created this extension is because I wanted to know what was happening with my data. I take privacy seriously!"
