Just enter the desired thread count in the interface and then add a new download task. You can add a new download task through the interface (top-section) or simply right-click on a desired download link and then click on the - Download with Accelerator - item in the context menu.\n\nNote: after adding a new URL, please adjust the number of threads. Also note that currently, the maximum number of threads is 5.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/download-accelerator-manager.html)."
