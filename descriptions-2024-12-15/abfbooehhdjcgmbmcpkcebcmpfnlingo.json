Found a cool and inspiring image anywhere online? Remix it instantly with lots of amazing AI workflows. Right click on any image, write a prompt (or hit the ✨ to let AI do the prompting) and restyle the image with your prompts. \n\nThe default workflows include Style Transfer remixers (letting you change the content of an image while keeping its style), Controlnets (letting you keep the shape of an image, but totally remix its style) and Face Transfer workflows letting you put your face into completely different contexts and styles. After each generation, you can also easily remove the background or upscale your image with more AI magic with just a click. \n\nAll workflows are powered by glif.app, where you can easily create your own glifs (aka AI workflows!) and then bring to the extension, using LLMs like GPT-4, and image generation powered by a deep StableDiffusion and comfyUI integration right in the app. \n\nThe default presets include Style Hunger, Style Changer, Face Transfer, Strict Controlnet, Face into Style, Free Form Image Manipulator, Creative Controlnet, and Style Hunter with latent Upscale, but the sky is the limit when creating or remixing your own glif presets. \n\nWe highly recommend to use the extension on public domain resources such as Public Domain Review or artvee, which are excellent sources for all sorts of amazing art styles and inspiration!\n\nFor those using comfyUI locally, we’ve added alpha support to run your local workflows from the extension."
