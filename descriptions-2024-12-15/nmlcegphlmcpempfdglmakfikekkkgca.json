Next thing you know, it's 2 hours later and you've watched 14 different \"how to be productive\" videos on YouTube (ironic, right?), read every news article about that random topic you suddenly HAD to know about, and somehow ended up deep in threads about conspiracy theories involving pigeons. Meanwhile, that important task? Still sitting there, untouched.\nHedge is here to help break this cycle. It's not another complicated \"productivity system\" ‚Äì it's a straightforward Chrome extension that helps you stay focused by keeping you away from the sites that always seem to pull you away from what matters.\n\nKey Features:\n\n‚è∞ Smart Time Blocking: Set your active hours (like 9 AM to 5 PM) and working days to automatically enable site blocking during your productive hours. Because your focus time should match your actual work schedule.\nüéØ Goal-Aligned Blocking: Set your work hours and active days to automatically keep distracting sites at bay when you need to focus. Because we all know willpower alone isn't enough.\n‚ö° Smart Pomodoro Timer: Built-in 25-minute focus sessions with short (5-minute) and long (15-minute) breaks help you maintain actual, sustainable productivity. No more \"just 5 more minutes\" that turns into 3 hours.\nüîí Flexible Site Access: Block entire domains (like youtube*) or specific pages. Whitelist the stuff you actually need, blacklist the stuff that keeps stealing your time. Simple as that.\n‚ò¢Ô∏è Nuclear Mode: When you absolutely, positively MUST get something done, enable Nuclear Mode. It locks your blocking settings until your predetermined time is up. Future you will thank present you.\nüé® Intuitive and User-Friendly: No PhD required. Simple setup, straightforward controls, and a clean interface that doesn't need a manual to understand.\n\nTake back control of your time with Hedge. Whether you're a student trying to survive finals week, a professional working on important projects, or just someone who wants to be more intentional with their browsing habits, Hedge helps you stay focused on what actually matters.\n\n\nWe Value Your Input! üåü\n\nYour feedback helps make Hedge better! If you find Hedge helpful in your productivity journey, please consider leaving us a 5-star review. Got ideas, questions,  bugs, or just want to share your Hedge success story? Drop us a line at info@hedge.coach or submit your feedback through the extension popup.\n\n\nAbout Permissions ‚ÑπÔ∏è\n\nWhen you install Hedge, you'll notice it requests permission to \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit.\" This might sound broad, but it's necessary for Hedge to do its job effectively - we need this permission to recognize and block distracting websites when you're trying to focus. Think of it like a bouncer who needs to check IDs at every door to keep the party running smoothly!\nFor total transparency: Hedge needs these permissions to function as your productivity guardian, helping you stay on track across all websites you visit. We take this responsibility seriously and use these permissions solely for the purpose of keeping you focused and productive."
