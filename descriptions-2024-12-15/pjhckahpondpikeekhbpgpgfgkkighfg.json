Deep Links consist of using a hyperlink that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed, piece of web content (e.g. http://example.com/path/page), rather than the home page (e.g. http://example.com/). \n \nFor manual review, this provides a simple, direct way to easily access Pro Insight results and autofill all inputs by clicking a link. The Deep Link Builder saves time, is easy to implement, and eliminates the need to copy and paste a customerâ€™s name, address(es), phone(s), IP address, email address, and other search parameters into multiple search windows. \n \nDeep Link Builder allows you to:\n\nAccess full Pro Insight Identity Review and Merchant Review results with a single click\nGet up and running with zero development effort\nStreamline user log-in with single sign-on (SSO) \n \nHow it works:\nAfter downloading this extension, the account admin will need to create a one-time reusable template, which then allows any user to generate a query with a single click directly out of a proprietary platform and into Pro Insight.\n \nNeed help or have questions on how to set up the extension? Contact your dedicated account manager or reach support at support@ekata.com to learn more.\n \nAbout Ekata Pro Insight:\nPro Insight empowers manual review and underwritings teams to make faster and more accurate identity fraud decisions on a global scale. Get the full picture of an identity behind a transaction or application in a single view. Pro Insight is tailored for manual review agents to highlight the critical data points to simplify complex fraud decisions."
