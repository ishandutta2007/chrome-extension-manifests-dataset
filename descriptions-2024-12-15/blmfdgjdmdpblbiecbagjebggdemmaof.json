Watch lectures on plane rides, road trips, or even put them on your phone without worrying about using data! Or make a compilation video of all the bad jokes your professor says.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: With the extension enabled, you can simply go to a specific lecture, click on the extension icon, and download! \n\nPlayback: though there's no option to download a lecture at a specific speed for faster viewing, I recommend VLC Media player as a mp4 viewer that lets you adjust speed. \n\nNotes\n------\n- All lectures saved on the CAEN Lecture Capture Service (leccap.engin.umich.edu) are eligible for download.\n- The extension currently saves the file to your default Downloads folder, and titles it after the lecture's title. Let me know if you'd like more customization with this.\n- The extension currently is limited to downloading one lecture at a time. Batch downloading possibly in the future."
