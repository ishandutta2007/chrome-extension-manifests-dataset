I love everything about MyFitnessPal, except for their charts. They leave much to be desired, especially if you want to weigh yourself daily.\n\nThis extension adds an extra chart to the MyFitnessPal reports page that shows an exponentially smoothed moving average. This functionality was inspired by \"The Hacker's Diet\".\n\nThe extension does not store or otherwise analyze any of your information. We just enhance the existing browser experience when visiting the MyFitnessPal reports page.\n\nPlease note that this is a super early beta. I will be enhancing it regularly.\n\nReleases:\n\n0.0.10: Fix issue where chart was not rendered correctly if there was no user entry for the current day.\n0.0.5: Fix issue where dates from other regions weren't parsed correctly.\n0.0.4: Fix issue where padding was added to page body."
