If you follow sites that post many articles, they may spam you with the same article over and over. If you are tired of that you can use 'Twitter Unclutterer' to hide the tweets with repeated links and reduce the clutter in your twitter timeline. \n\nOther users post many tweets per day, you can use 'Twitter Unclutterer' to limit the maximum amount of daily tweets you see from any user. \n\nBesides, you can hide the 'Who to follow' and 'Trends' sections, and you can get notified if twitter changes your timeline to 'Top Tweets' instead of chronological. \n\nWorks for Twitter in english and spanish, if you want support in other language let me know and I can do it.\n\nIt's open source! Check the code here: https://github.com/vixark/Twitter-Unclutterer\n\nYou can also block certain words in twitter to further uncluttering.
