Also there is now a small bit of code at the very bottom of the JavaScript file, which allows the top navigation bar to be altered on any page on the Roblox website.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Experience Update on Roblox is ugly as Hell, and we all hate it. So I've made an extension that tries its best to undo it, through replacing text and altering elements of the website to get rid of as much evidence as possible that the new update exists.\n\nInstall it and enjoy, no need to click any buttons, the changes happen automatically upon the page loading. \nLet me know if I forgot to undo any parts of the updates, and I will fix them as best I can."
