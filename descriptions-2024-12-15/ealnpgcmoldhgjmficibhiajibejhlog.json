Strip away the noise of social metrics and rediscover genuine engagement.\n\nLike UnTrap for YouTube, Antisocial X creates a more mindful social media experience. The extension provides a truly neutral browsing experience on X (fka Twitter), allowing users to engage with content based solely on its inherent value, without visible engagement metrics, follower counts, or social proof indicators.\n\nNew Features in v1.1:\n- Address Bar Menu - Mode Toggles\n- Two New Modes: Antisocial Mode & Disable Notifications\n\nKey Features:\n- Hides follower counts, like counts, retweet counts, and view counts\n- Removes 'Followed by' and 'Followers you know' sections\n- Disable Notifications mode to minimize distractions\n- Maintains all core interactive features (like, retweet, follow)\n- Works on both twitter.com and x.com\n\nBenefits:\n- Evaluate content based on quality, not popularity\n- Reduce social pressure and comparison\n- Focus on meaningful interactions\n- Experience more diverse perspectives\n\nPrivacy: This extension operates entirely locally and does not collect any user data.\n\nWarning: May promote critical thinking and authentic expression! ðŸ˜‰\n\nOpen source: https://github.com/qi-kayon/antisocial_x"
