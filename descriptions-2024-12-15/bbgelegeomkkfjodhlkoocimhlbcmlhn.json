That's why it's crucial to know if a website is safe or not before you trust it with your cash.\n\nThis is where the BrokerChooser Scam Broker Shield extension helps – if you land on a broker website that is contained in our vast database, you will get an immediate notification on whether you can trust that broker or not. This can help prevent you transferring funds to potential scam providers, or, if you have already sent them money, take steps to try recovering your funds and stop you from suffering any further losses.\n\nOur database is based on our own research and by compiling data from various warning lists published by top-tier global financial regulators, such as the FCA in the UK or the US’s SEC.\n\n***\n\nWHAT YOU WILL SEE\n\nDepending on the site you are visiting, you will get a warning pop-up with information about the broker or financial provider behind the site. \n\nWe give a clear verdict: TRUSTED or NOT TRUSTED.\n\n- If it is a NOT TRUSTED broker, we will tell you the reason why our experts do not trust them (the main reason is usually a lack of top-quality regulation). You can also go straight to our site to find out more reasons behind the negative verdict, e.g. if the broker is on a warning list of a regulator. \n\n- If it is TRUSTED broker, there several versions of what additional information we provide:\nIf BrokerChooser has a detailed review about the broker (we have more than 100 reviews), you will see our review score and can check out the review itself via a link.\n- If we have not yet reviewed the broker, we give a quick summary on why we trust them, based on how robust its regulator is (top-tier or mid-tier).\n- It is also possible that no information (either positive or negative) is available on the website you have landed on. In this case, we advise you to drop us a line and ask for a quick broker check – do not risk your money with unknown, shady providers!\n\nLast updated: Oct 2023"
