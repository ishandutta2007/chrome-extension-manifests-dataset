Unfortunately it seems YouTube may be detecting the extension so you may see the \"ad blockers are not allowed\" popup when ads are skipped. Sadly I am unsure yet of what to do, but when possible I will try looking into it. I also want to confirm if this extension really is being detected by YouTube.\n\nv1.1.2 - Hotfix (10/09/2024)\n-Fixed extension not clicking the skip ad button (Again). \n-Fixed \"fix adskipper\" button so now it should actually fix the problem it detects.\n\n*Note: Technically not an AdBlock, this clicks the skip button on skippable ads, and tries to speed up unskippable ads. Allowing ads to still be shown, while limiting the interuptions for the user.\n\nMost features can be enabled/disabled by clicking on the extension. \n(Features may be disabled by default)\n\nFeatures:\n-Auto Skip Ads\n-Auto Mute Ads\n-Speed Up Unskippable Ads\n-Personal Rank\n\n10 Ranks with their own icons ready to be claimed!\n\nYou can now find most information, updates, changes, and known issues on the website! https://adskip.markgurney.dev/"
