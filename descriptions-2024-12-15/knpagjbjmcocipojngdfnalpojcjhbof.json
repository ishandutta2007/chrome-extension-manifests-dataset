This initial MVP release just tells you how many images were found on a page, how many non-empty alt tags were found on the page, and what all of the alt text is. It will flag alt text that appears to be just the filename. The idea is to give you a quick way to summarize how alt tags are being used and how they can be improved. Still in development and very open to feedback and ideas for features."
