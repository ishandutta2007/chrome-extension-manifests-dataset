Using community-driven voting, it allows users to collaboratively identify and hide unwanted political tweets. The extension seamlessly integrates with X's interface, adding a thumbs-down button to each tweet for easy voting. Voted tweets are instantly hidden from your feed, and once they cross the community vote threshold, they will be hidden for all users. Built with privacy in mind, it only tracks tweet IDs, and no user information whatsoever."
