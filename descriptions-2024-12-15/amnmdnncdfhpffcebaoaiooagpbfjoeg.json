A image capture is taken whenever the active tab completes loading and, optionally, at intervals.\n\nThis is primarily a tool to experiment with Chrome's tabs API's captureVisibleTab method. Unless you are interested in post-processing the image data or experimenting with different format, quality and delay settings, then this is probably not for you.\n\nDue to the asynchronous nature of the JavaScript events, there is no absolute guarantee that the captured tab corresponds to the active tab that completed loading. No details about the tab (such as id, title or URL) are recorded with the captures.\n\nThe image data are timestamped, stored locally in an IndexedDB table and can be downloaded for further processing etc. At present, there is no convenient mechanism for freeing up storage, other than by removing the extension; this will be added in a future version.\n\nThe following are controllable via options:\n\n* PNG or JPEG format captures\n* JPEG quality setting\n* delay between tab load completion and capture request (milliseconds)\n* (minimum) interval between periodic captures (seconds)\n\nNote that some, maybe all, internal chrome:// pages cannot be captured from a service worker context.\n\nThis extension's extensive permissions are only used to call chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab from a service worker that runs in the background. There are no mutating API calls except to write to the IndexedDB table and no data are sent or received by the extension.\n\nChange Log\n\n0.0.2\n\nInclude local ISO date/time as part of the downloaded file name.\nAdd some missing semicolons.\n\n0.0.1 initial revision"
