You will be presented with a game board that you can step through using the spacebar, or click on clues of your own choosing.  Keep track of your \"Coryat\" score as you go and compare it to the combined \"Coryat\" score for the game. Use the help button to see how to interact with the game.\n\nA NOTE about broken images:  the J-archive site itself seems to have a lot of trouble with broken images in their clues, so if you see a broken resource, this is due to the site itself and not the fault of j-play.  If enough people bug the J-archive site about it maybe it will get fixed.\n\nSome recent releases:\n\n1.4.0 - Handle website change for clue & response markup.\n1.3.3 - Improved Coryat handling; handle domain w/o \"www\".\n1.3.2 - Leave typing unaffected into input fields such as search.\n1.3.1 - Handle all the upcoming guest hosts. Simplified w/o jQuery.\n1.3.0 - Handle https switchover & Ken as the first guest host.\n1.2.9 &\n1.2.8 - Added tie-breaker clue support (for rare tournaments).\n1.2.7 - Improved the responses when Alex supplies extra info.\n1.2.6 - Fixed some new formatting issues.\n1.2.5 - Fixed breakage due to Chrome extension changes.\n1.2.4 - Add text shadows.\n1.2.3 &\n1.2.2 - more response-parsing improvements\n1.2.1 - handle banter and links in FJ clues\n1.2.0 - add toggle for upper-casing clue text"
