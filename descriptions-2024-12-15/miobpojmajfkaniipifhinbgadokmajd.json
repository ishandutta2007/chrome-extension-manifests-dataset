To scour statistics directly by the names of companies, check out the Search page.\n\nOutr will systematically update its icon to reflect the number of matches discovered on a given tab. To see this in action, make sure to pin the extension.\n\nOutr streamlines the process of posting to social media with pre-populated Tweets. To share your insights, press the Twitter icon next to a particular match.\n\nOutr does not collect, share, or sell your data. All code runs locally.
