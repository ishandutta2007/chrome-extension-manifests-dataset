Sorry for the delay, UI should now be easier to access!\n\n* * *\n\nRequest Maker is a tool for penetration testing. With it you can easily capture requests made by web pages, tamper with the URL, headers and POST data and, of course, make new requests. Request Maker only captures requests sent via HTML forms and XMLHttpRequests; it doesn't fill the log with useless information about images and style sheets. The logs are tab-specific, displayed in the page action popup, and the requests are bookmarkable. After sending a request you can just click on the bookmark button like you would on any other page.\n\nFor quick access, bookmark this URL: chrome-extension://kajfghlhfkcocafkcjlajldicbikpgnp/rm.html\n\n* * *\n\nKnown issues: \n- Due to built-in limitations in XHR, not all headers can be modified. See http://goo.gl/Woeao.\n- XHR transparently follows redirects (as per http://goo.gl/mEwGh) without providing a way to retrieve the final URL. This sometimes causes incorrect rendering in the Document tab.\n\nQuestions? Problems? Suggestions? Bugs?\n- You'll find my email address in the options page of the extension."
