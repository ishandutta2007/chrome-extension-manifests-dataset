If it finds one, some text on the page will glow.  Hovering over the text will trigger a pop-up containing the quotation from Keats that echoes it.  Clicking on this pop-up will open a new window containing the original poem.  Hovering over the glowing words once more will make the pop-up disappear. \n\nNightingale remembers which Keatsian quotes you have recently stumbled upon and tries to give you fresh ones.  If you read a quote for at least ten seconds, Nightingale will give you a break and not show you any more pop-ups for several days."
