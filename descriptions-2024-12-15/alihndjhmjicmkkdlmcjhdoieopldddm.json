Previously, you would have to check our massive ASIN list, or browse our Affiliate Product Database to find products to feature. Now you won’t even have to leave Amazon.com.\n\nWhen a Perch product appears anywhere on an Amazon page on your browser, whether in search results pages, or even in the Related Products section on a competitor’s product page, the Perchandiser will alert you and show you where to find our commission-eligible listings."
