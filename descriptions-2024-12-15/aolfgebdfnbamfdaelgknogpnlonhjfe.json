This extension is intended to be used as a friendly prank.\n\nCode: https://github.com/jmt-chromeextensions/HiBarbie\n\n\nFYI: Extensions are not activated automatically when they are installed. This extension, like many others you have tried probably, starts working on all the corresponding tabs at the right moment it is installed, but this is not the default behaviour. Take in mind that if you install an extension sometime and it doesn't work on the tabs you have already open, you may need to refresh those tabs with F5 key or by clicking on the reload button located in the browser's top left corner."
