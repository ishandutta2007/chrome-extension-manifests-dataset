But with this app you get:\n✔️ A SOP library\n✔️ A fast and easy to access search option\n✔️ A user management system for security\n✔️ Easy maintenance \n✔️ To record processes with one click\n\n‼️ But the most important feature is this ↓\n🔹Gear will show you relevant SOPs based on the URL you are visiting. That way you will avoid clutter and increase the chance that people will consult your SOP.\n\nExample:\nLet's say a colleague of mine is ill, and i have to send out our newsletter. I go to mailchimp.com and now The Gear Icon will change to a \"1️\" meaning one SOP is available at this specific domain. No need to go though a ton of SOP's, just consult the one that Gear provides you with.\n\n\n📩A small message to anyone reading this:\nI am absolutely delighted, that you have found my extension. \n\nI made Gear as a solution to a problem I faced in my own company. SOPs (Standard Operation Procedures) or processes, are key to the successful scalability of any company.\nIt allows colleagues to step up and help solve a \"job to be done\", when another colleague is ill, on vacation or on maternity leave.\n\nI believe it is the mark of a good company to solve the jobs at hand, without having to disturb the person who is not at work. \n\nBut SOPs have a ton of issues. Many of which pertains to creating and maintaining them. \nThe first problem we face is: \nThe chance of an SOP being created or updated will increase with the lowering of barriers. \n\nWith Gear, you can easily create and maintain SOPs from your browser without having to disrupt your workflow, in order to find the place where your company keep the SOPs and then look for the right one to update.\nJust click the icon, and see the available SOPs attached to the url you are currently on, create or click edit to update!\n\nBut SOPs have another problem, well 3 problems actually. I call them \"The ABC's of SOP's\"\n🔤 Awareness: Most employees wont know that an SOP exists, so how can they follow it!\n🔤 Barriers: Even if they know it exists, they might not know where to find it or what it is called!\n🔤 Change: And if they know it exists and they think they already know all the steps, they wont check to see if an update/change has been made.\n\nGear fixes all of this 🔥\n🔹The icon lets you know if a SOPs is relevant for the current URL you are on.\n🔹Gear will show you a list of select SOPs that pertains only to the work you are doing, by checking the URL you are currently on.\n🔹Gear will let you know if a SOP has been updated since the last time you read it. Asking you to go and read the changes.\n\nAnd that it. A potential solution to one of the most boring problems. Because an SOP really only works if it makes your job easier.\n\nThanks so much for using Gear.\nTheGearApp.com\n\n\n🍾 Latest Features 🍾\nLatest update is a massive on.\n🔹Ability to record processes with one click\n🔹Ability to invite user\n🔹Improved dashboard\n🔹User roles implemeted\n🔹Inserting images or video"
