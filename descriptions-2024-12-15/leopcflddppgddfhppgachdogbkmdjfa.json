Are you tired of your bookmarks being clogged with Rate Your Music links? Well, here's a solution.\n\nIf you are an avid user of Rate Your Music, you have certainly run into the issue of managing your backlog. Managing and tracking your backlog can be overwhelming and time consuming, and Rate Your Music lacks a way to easily categorize music you would like to eventually listen to. BackLog is here to solve this issue.\n\nBackLog will allow you to store the albums you want to listen to in an extension, freeing your bookmarks bar from unnecessary links.\n\nWith BackLog, you can sort your albums with beautiful cover art, filter by specified criteria, and head directly to the Rate Your Music page to read reviews and rate the album! You can even click the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button if you want BackLog to choose an album from your BackLog for you to listen to!\n\nFEATURES\n\nAlbum Filtering:\nBacklog includes filtering by all sorts of criteria, such as Album, Artist, Genre, Rating, and Date Added. \n\nBackLog Searching: \nYou can also search your Backlog with the search bar in order to narrow down your results! You can filter these results even more by using the filters. BackLog will dynamically filter your search results based off of what you select!\n \nBackLog Management:\nManaging your BackLog is important, so you can individually delete unwanted items from it with a single click. You can even delete your entire BackLog with one button!\n\nINSTALLATION \n\nBackLog installs as an extension on Chrome. Click on the BackLog icon to open the extension.\n\nWhen you find an album you want to BackLog, click the \"BackLog this album\" button to store it in the extension!\n\nIf you would like to search your BackLog, you can utilize the search bar and find albums based off of the criteria you provide. If you want BackLog to choose an album for you, click the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button.\n\nYou can also sort via Album, Artist, Genre, Rating, and Date Added via the blue button under the search bar. Click these buttons multiple times to toggle between a descending and ascending sort. These filters even work when searching!\n\nOnce an album has been stored in BackLog, you can click on the album to take yourself to it's Rate Your Music page.\n\nYou can delete albums by hovering over them and clicking the X in the top left corner. You can clear your entire BackLog by hitting the red \"Clear All\" button. Keep in mind, this is PERMANENT and cannot be undone!\n\nPRIVACY & SECURITY\n\nBackLog does not collect ANY of your personal data. It simply requires Local Storage permission so that your BackLog doesnâ€™t get erased after you close Chrome or turn off your PC.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nIf you encounter a bug, please contact me on Github or via email! \n\nGithub: andrewglanzzz\n\nEmail: andrewdglanz@gmail.com"
