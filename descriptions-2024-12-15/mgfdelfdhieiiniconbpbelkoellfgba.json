The extension helps you record your tasks effortlessly and automate routine processes. If you need to synchronize logs between several trackers, use our one-click ‘export’ feature so you can keep your mind on the task at hand. “Stay productive!” — as your manager says ;)\n\nHow it works:\n- install the Worklog Tracker extension (it’s free!),\n- sign up using your favorite e-mail address,\n- sign in to the time tracker of your choice,\n- start tracking,\n- pause or stop tracking to have lunch,\n- synchronize logs, if necessary,\n- finish all your work and chill out!\n\nNB If you want to log time directly in Jira, open the page with the issue you want to log, start Worklog Tracker and watch the magic happen.\n\nFor feedback and bug reports, please write us at hello@worklogtrаcker.com.\nCheck out our website https://worklogtracker.com/.\nWe’re also on twitter, so сome say hello.\n\nPeace, love, productivity!"
