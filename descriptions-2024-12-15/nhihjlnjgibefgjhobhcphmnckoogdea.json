Completing a transaction doesnâ€™t require entering any sensitive information.\n\nWaves Enterprise Wallet is designed for convenience, so you can sign transactions with just a couple of clicks. Users can create multiple wallets and switch between them easily, and if you ever forget the password to the account you can recover it from your SEED, as normal.\n\nYou can view the source code for Waves Enterprise Wallet on GitHub, or check it like any other Chrome extension.\n\nhttps://github.com/waves-enterprise/we-wallet"
