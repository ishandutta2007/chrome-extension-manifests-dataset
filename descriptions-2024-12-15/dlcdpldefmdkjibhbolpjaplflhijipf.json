I helps you grow, curate your feed, tweak the UI and so much more!\n\nNow updated to work with X.com!\n\nWe are greatly influenced by the content we’re exposed to, but we have little to no control over it. RefinedTweets fixes that by giving you control. With RefinedTweets, you can set your own rules.\n\nRefinedTweets does this by filtering tweets on various data points. For example, you can set filters to say:\n- Show tweets only from people who are verified, or not verified\n- Show tweets that have less than 20 replies\n- Show tweets from people with less than 5K followers \n...and much more.\nGrowing your audience or getting rid of the noise — control provided by RefinedTweets will aid you goal.\nPlease visit our website to learn more: https://refinedtweets.com/\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nTweet-based filters:\nYou can filter tweets based on its age, Favourites, Replies, Bookmarks, Retweets, Quote Tweets, Content of the tweets, or even Regex if you're that person. Example: Show Tweets that have less than 5 replies - great for discovering tweets that went under the radar. Or, Show Tweets that have more than 10 quote tweets - great for discovering tweets that are being talked about.\n\nUser-based filters:\nYou can filter tweets based on their users attributes. Supported data points includes number of Followers, Blue Verification, DM Status, Account age, Tweet count etc. Example: Show me tweets from people with less than 1K followers, or, show me tweets from verified users who has more than 5K tweets in total etc.\n\nBlock Promoted Tweets:\nRefined Tweets helps you further remove the noise buy letting you block promoted tweets on your feed. This feature is available for both free and pro users.\n\nUI Refinements:\nBesides filtering out tweets, RefineTweets also lets you hide unnecessary parts from the Twitter UI to provide a cleaner and better user experience. For example, you can hide the impression/view-count if you're not interested in it. It also includes a special Minimal mode that provides a much cleaner feed experience.\n\nStats:\nThe Stat section provides you with some data to help you uncover insights about your Twitter usage. For now, it will show you the number of tweets filtered out by the rules you set, with so many more on the way.\n\nAll the UI refinement features, Stats and 1 filter (any) are free for users.
