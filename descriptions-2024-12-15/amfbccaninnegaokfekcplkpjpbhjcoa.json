This tool offers an innovative solution for efficient data management, ensuring a seamless and more productive interaction with the Zenith platform and Advanced Search, as well as Onboarded. As a Zenith user, you might often find yourself navigating through a wealth of information, handling multiple search instances. Zenith Extend addresses these challenges by providing a robust and automated data transfer system between the two platforms, even when they are operating in separate tabs. \n\nBut Zenith Extend is not just about data transfer. It is about establishing an intelligent, integrated workspace that allows users to engage with multiple pairs of Zenith and tools such as Advanced Search and Onboarded concurrently. Whether you are researching, analysing data, or conducting comprehensive searches, this extension enhances your productivity by facilitating effortless data handling and manipulation.\n\nPermissions Explanation: \nTo ensure that Zenith Extend operates effectively and delivers an exceptional user experience, we require several permissions: \n\nActiveTab: This permission allows us to interact with the currently active tab where Zenith and Advanced Search/Onboarded are operating. It enables the extension to read the URL and contents of the active tab, which is essential for data transfer operations. \n\nTabs: These permissions are crucial for managing multiple search instances across different tabs and tab groups. They help in coordinating data transfer and synchronization between various Zenith and Advanced Search/Onboarded instances. \n\nStorage: This permission is required to save user preferences and extension settings locally on your browser. It ensures that your personalized settings are retained for future browsing sessions. \n\nAt Zenith Extend, we deeply respect and protect user privacy. We assure you that these permissions are used strictly for the functionalities stated above and not for any other purposes. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data without explicit user consent."
