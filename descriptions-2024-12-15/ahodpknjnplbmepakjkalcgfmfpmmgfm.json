It is a lightweight extension that can be easily installed on the Google Chrome browser, and it provides users with the ability to specify the keywords they want to censor.\n\nWhen a user installs the plugin, they can enter a list of words and phrases that they want to be censored. The plugin will then scan web pages and block out any text or images that contain the specified keywords. This can be useful for individuals who want to avoid triggering content, such as violence or profanity, or for those who want to limit their exposure to certain topics or persons.\n\nThe plugin is designed to be unobtrusive and user-friendly. When it blocks content, it displays a black block in its place, and users can easily toggle the plugin on and off if they want to temporarily view the content that has been censored."
