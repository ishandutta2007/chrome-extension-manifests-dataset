This extension also vastly improves the design of the registration page, making it both more presentable and easier to read.\n\nWhen searching for courses, two additional columns titled Course Difficulty and Rate My Professors will appear. The Course Difficulty column presents the average rating of the overall difficulty of the course as well as a link to the reviews in the database. The Rate My Professors column presents a link to that professor's rating on ratemyprofessors.com. Discussion and Lab sections will only display N/A since TA's aren't around long enough to gather reviews on RMP. \n\nIcon designed by Michelle Nguyen\nInstagram: @_mai_han"
