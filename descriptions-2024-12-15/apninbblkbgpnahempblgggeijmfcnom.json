Can't think of anything you feel like eating?\n\nRandomeal here for the rescue!\n\nAll you need to do is:\n   1. Install the extension on your chrome.\n   2. Give it the access to the 10bis tab.\n   3. Click the GET RANDOM RESTAURANT button.\n\nThere you got it - a random restaurant.\n\nNot satisfied with the option received? Go back and try again :)\n\n*** This extension has nothing to do with 10bis or takeaway. It is just built on the 10bis website as a side project. It does not fetch any user information or do anything other than click on a random restaurant in the homepage.\n\n*** Don't believe me? Take a look at the code: https://github.com/hadasarik/randomeal\n\nAll icons made by Pixel perfect: www.flaticon.com"
