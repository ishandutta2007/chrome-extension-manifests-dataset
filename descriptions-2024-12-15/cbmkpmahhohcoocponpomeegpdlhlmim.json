The SDK client has batching enabled by default (for good reasons!), so to find out if your event was sent, you need to search through all requests and manually split messages before formatting them as JSON. Or manually log payloads before sending, which is fine, but not convenient.\n\nThanks to the power of LLMs and endless hours spent on writing CSS to make the UI look like native tab in DevTools, you can enjoy your work again."
