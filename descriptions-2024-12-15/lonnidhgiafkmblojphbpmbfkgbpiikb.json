Simply DuckDuckGo/Google as usual and you will see results from your browsing history alongside. \n\nPRIVACY: Sailboat Search works completely locally (No data is sent to me/google or anyone else) \n\nFeatures:\n✓ See results from Browser History when you Google/DuckDuckGo\n✓ Completely Local (No data is sent to me/google or anyone else)\n✓ Mark Pages that you consider important (Just click the extension button)\n✓ Get full text search on these Marked Pages when you Google\n✓ Option to Automatically Mark pages as important, on which you spend considerable time.\n\nFor help after downloading the extension, just right click the extension icon on top right and go to options. You might have to pin the extension first. \n\nSailboat Search has been possible because of Sailboat (a chrome extension that compartmentalizes your browsing experience and does much more). Sailboat is available in its dev version on the chrome web store."
