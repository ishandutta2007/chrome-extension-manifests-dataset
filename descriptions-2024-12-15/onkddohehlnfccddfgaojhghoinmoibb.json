This type of extension typically allows you to import a private key  and then use it to sign transactions or messages.\n\nOne advantage of using a signing-only wallet extension is that it provides an additional layer of security compared to using a full-featured wallet. By only allowing you to sign transactions, it minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to your funds. Additionally, because it is a lightweight extension, it may have lower system requirements and be faster to use than a full-featured wallet.\n\nHowever, a signing-only wallet extension may not offer the same range of features as a full-featured wallet. For example, you may not be able to view your balance or transaction history directly from the extension, and you may need to use a separate tool to broadcast signed transactions to the network. Nonetheless, a signing-only wallet extension can be a useful tool for those who need to sign transactions or messages frequently, and want a simple, secure, and lightweight way to do so."
