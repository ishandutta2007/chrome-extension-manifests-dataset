So forget about trying to organize your bookmarks, or hunting through a jumble of titles trying to find that one page you just can't remember.\n\nBookmark away, just like you normally would. Froggy will extract the text from the page, and add it to a searchable database.\n\nClick Froggy to search. Your bookmarks are much easier to find, since you're not just relying on the scant words of the title, but on the content of the web pages themselves.\n\nThere's no need to categorize when you have good search. That's our theory.\n\nYou can easily remove bookmarks when you're done with them. Just click the red 'x'. That's all the \"bookmark management\" you'll need.\n\nLike we said, minimal effort. Make your computer work for you for a change."
