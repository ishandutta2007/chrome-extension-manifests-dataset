It enables developers to gain a deeper understanding of Fluid state in their application, offering insights into Container and Audience states, data visualization, and a live telemetry view with more functionality coming soon.\nTo get started, ensure that your Fluid application has integrated the developer tools library, and is configured to initialize them as a part of application startup. For more information, see here: https://aka.ms/fluiddevtool.\nFrom there, simply launch your application and open the \"Fluid Framework Devtools\" tab in the browserâ€™s devtools pane.\n\nThe left navigation panel shows all the containers in your application. Selecting a container will show the details on the right panel.\nRight panel shows the container state, current client ID and buttons to disconnect and close the selected container. Below that, the \"Data\", \"Audience\" and \"States\" tabs show more information.\nThe \"Data\" tab allows you to look at the Container data in hierarchical structure including data types and values.\nThe \"Audience\" tab allows you to view the users currently in the container, their client ID and permissions scopes. You also get a historical view of all users joining/leaving the container.\nThe \"States\" tab shows a log of container state changes (connect, attach, disconnect)\nSelecting \"Telemetry\"/\"Events\" in the left navigation shows a running log of framework events including details of the events.\n\nFluid Framework is a collection of client libraries for distributing and synchronizing shared states and makes it simple for developers to build real-time multiuser collaborative experiences.
