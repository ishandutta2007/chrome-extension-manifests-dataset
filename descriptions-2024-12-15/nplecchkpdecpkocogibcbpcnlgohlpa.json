By sorting by importance as opposed to chronologically you'll be made aware of what you should be focusing on right now. Tasks will show up not when they are due, but when you should deal with them.\n\nYou can easily add your own tasks, give them a due date and a priority and rest assured that they will show up in good time before they are due.\n\nThis is the product of a research project in the course Interaction Design Methods at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Designed by Jonathan Adam, Adrian Latupeirissa, Nikolaos Syropoulos and Carl TÃ¶rnqvist"
