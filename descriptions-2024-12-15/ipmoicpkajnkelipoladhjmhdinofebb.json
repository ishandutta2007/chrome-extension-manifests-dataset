They then recommend it to you as a GPA booster, but you'd much rather taken a course with less weighting on exams and more on homework: And you don't enjoy yourself when you take that course. \n\nMade for UBC students, Coursepenguin aims to correct that by grabbing available grade data for all of your courses and allowing users to vote on the difficulty of a course. Best of all, Coursepenguin shows you this information directly when you're looking for classes to register for. Make informed decisions about whether or not a class is for you.\n\nCurrently supports courses.ubc.ca and Canvas (Must be on a course homepage)!"
