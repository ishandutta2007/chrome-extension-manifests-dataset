It's designed to be used in conjunction with the built-in development tools of browsers but goes far beyond what they usually support at the cost of some user setup time.\n\nThis is a Chrome extension that makes it easy to use the Web Tracing Framework on your pages and gathers additional information from Chrome such as garbage collection events. It is designed to be used in conjunction with user instrumentation.\n\nFor more information on the Web Tracing Framework and how to get started, see: http://google.github.io/tracing-framework\n\nNOTE: until Chrome bug 158234 is fixed the timing information on Chrome/Windows is incorrect.
