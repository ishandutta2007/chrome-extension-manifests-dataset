The extension needs zero configuration. Once a new download request is submitted, the download link is sent to VirusTotal web service and will be checked for viruses. Once the report is ready, the extension evaluates the response and notify you if the link is a threat. If there are more than pre-defined positive responses to the link, a warning window will appear to notify you about the possible threats of this download. You can either decide to allow or deny this download.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Check every downloading job that is placed  to the download manager \n2. Works asynchronously, which means your downloading job is not being interrupted.\n3. Respects the rate limits of VirusTotal free API (it only checks once per 20 seconds for job results)\n\nWhat is VirusTotal (from Wikipedia):\n---\nVirusTotal aggregates many antivirus products and online scan engines to check for viruses that the user's antivirus may have missed, or to verify against any false positives. Files up to 128 MB can be uploaded to the website or sent via email. Anti-virus software vendors can receive copies of files that were flagged by other scans but passed by their engine, to help improve their software and, by extension, VirusTotal's capability. Users can also scan suspect URLs and search through the VirusTotal dataset. VirusTotal for dynamic analysis of malware use Cuckoo sandbox. VirusTotal was selected by PC World as one of the best 100 products of 2007.\n---\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://add0n.com/policies/yokris.dev.txt"
