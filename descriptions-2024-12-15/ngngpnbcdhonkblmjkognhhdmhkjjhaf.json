Images, texts, and nearly every HTML element forming the website's structure can be glitched with the click of a mouse. By moving the mouse over a glitched element, you continue to influence it in real-time. In the settings, one can adjust the file format used, having an aesthetic influence on the way things glitch. Optionally you can even download the glitched images by clicking, for introducing back into a website or compiling into animations. This extension builds upon \"p5.glitch\" - a byte-level glitching library for p5.js.\n\nGLITCH.ext accompanies the March 2021 Net Works for the House of Electronic Arts Basel (HeK),\nhttps://www.hek.ch/en/program/events-en/event/hek-net-works-ted-davis-glitchext.html\n\nAfter installing, be sure to 'pin' GLITCH.ext to your toolbar, so you can easily turn it off and on.\nClicking on the glitched finger icon, enables to you adjust these settings:\n\n- GLITCH off/on, toggles extension\n- REFRESH, clears glitches\n- FORMAT, set the image type of glitches\n- LINKS, turn OFF to glitch EVERYTHING\n- SAVE, toggles 2nd mouse click from un-glitch / download\n\nGlitches to page are only temporary. \nSimply refresh it to return things to 'normal'."
