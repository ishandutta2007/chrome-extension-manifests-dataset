However, instead of allowing your reading list to balloon into an overwhelming pile of links and articles that you'll probably never read, Sooner automatically removes links a few days after they're added.  This keeps your list neat and tidy with relevant things you care about right now.\n\nGet the app at https://sooner.app\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttps://sooner.app/privacy"
