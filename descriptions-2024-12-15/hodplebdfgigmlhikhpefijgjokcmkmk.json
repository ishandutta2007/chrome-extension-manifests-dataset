The tooltips are fast and brief, a sentence or two. The dictionary definitions give a full definition and, where appropriate, offer the legal authority (e.g., \"IDEA 34 CFR ยง300.320\"), synonyms, use in a sentence, and more. \n\nTo activate the tooltips for any page, click the extension's icon and all of the appropriate words and terms will have a dotted underline. Hover the mouse over the word and the tooltip will show.\n\nTo look up the word or phrase in the dictionary, highlight the word or phrase (double-click on a word or swipe the cursor over the word(s), while holding the left mouse button down). Once highlighted, right-click and chose \"DEFINE highlighted word or phrase\" ... much simpler than it sounds.\n\nYou can use both at the same time. Showing the tooltips will also let you know what words are in the dictionary, they use the same database. The database will be updated very often at first so make sure you are using the latest version. \n\nAnd feedback is always welcomed."
