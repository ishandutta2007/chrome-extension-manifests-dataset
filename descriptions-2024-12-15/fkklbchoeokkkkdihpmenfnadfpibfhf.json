From viewing, editing and creating calendar invites, Jira tickets, pull requests, to-do lists, tasks and more, to collaborating with teams and having fun while you work, Making Today does it all. With customisable widgets, it puts you in control and eliminates the need to open multiple tabs, apps or windows and thus, improves your workflow.\n\n\nWith the Chrome Extension, you get to bring all of these functionalities even more closer. \n\n- Set your customised dashboard as your “New Tab”, which improves productivity and gives you one-click access to everything you need.\n\n- Use a sidebar that stays with you as you surf the web, thereby keeping you in the loop on what matters at all times.\n\n- Take notes, add tasks, join meetings, and do much more without any extra tabs."
