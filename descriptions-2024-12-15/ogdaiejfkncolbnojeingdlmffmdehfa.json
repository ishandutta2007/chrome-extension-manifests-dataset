Once you access the Portfolio section of your Degiro account it automatically calculates some interesting statistics about your portfolio and renders them into a table. This way you can have a better overview of your assets.\n\nThe extension currently displays the following: Total portfolio value, Absolute and relative portfolio change, Invested amount.\n\nAll calculations are done locally in your browser. The extension does not communicate with any server in any way. This means that there is no way for us to compromise your data since it never leaves your device.\n\nYou can verify this by looking at the source code on GitHub https://github.com/szymsza/degiro-statistics"
