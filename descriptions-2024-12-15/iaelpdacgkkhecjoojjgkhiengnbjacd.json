Not only does this impact our productivity, but it can be frustrating   too. \n\nTired of reminding AI about the same things, over and over? Well, no more!\n\nThe cure for AI amnesia is here! Now, your favorite AI tools can remember important things about you and recall them when you need them most.\n\nMemoryPlugin for Chrome adds long term memory (the ability to remember across chats) to your chats with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and LibreChat! This allows your favorite AI tools to remember and recall important information, making your experience more personalised and useful over time. New chats are no longer a blank slate with MemoryPlugin!\n\nSupported Platforms\nChatGPT web app (and mobile app via our Custom GPT, https://chatgpt.com/g/g-pPRwrR7LI-memoryplugin)\nClaude web app\nGemini web app\nLibreChat web app\nTypingMind web app (via a dedicated TypingMind plugin, available from our dashboard once you create a new account: https://www.memoryplugin.com)\n\nYour memory is shared across all the supported platforms, so you are not locked into any one AI tool and can freely use the best tool for the job. \n\nYou are in full control of your memories. From our dashboard, you can add new memories or permanently delete old ones. All your data is encrypted and secured. We only store the minimum amount of data necessary to provide long term memory for your AI chats. We only store short snippets and summaries, and we never store your full chats. \n\nHow to use MemoryPlugin for Chrome\nTo use our browser extension, install the extension and log in to your account on https://www.memoryplugin.com. When you open any of the supported platforms, you will see a button that will allow you to inject your memories into the chat in one click. The AI can also instruct the extension to add new memories seamlessly.  All this processing happens on your device, and you will be able to see what the AI has stored. \n\nMemoryPlugin is not affiliated with any of the supported tools.
