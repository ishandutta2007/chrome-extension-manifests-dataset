Block separate videos, users or whole channels with only one click! Naturally, the add-on supports regular expressions to ensure you the best customisation possible. And another thing: no user information is collected.\n\nDo you like what we do? Do you want to support us and our work? A subscription on Patreon would help a lot at developing this tool as well as realising our future projects.\nDo you want to support us even more? Please donate and buy us a drink to stay hydrated (Hydration is important, though!)..\n\nNew features:\n- Fixed duplicate block buttons displayed on comments\n- We have completely reworked Channel Blocker from scratch.\n- Channel Blocker is now Open Source find the code here: https://github.com/Time-Machine-Development/Channel-Blocker-Manifest-v3 \n- Channel block now works with the new manifest v3"
