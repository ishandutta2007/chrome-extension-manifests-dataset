The idea of the platform started when we were looking for free shortening APIs with no limit or public API without limitation. In December 2014 we started the current platform on a basic level, and since then we started updating the platform and offer our users Social Media Statistics (Facebook, Twitter and Google+).\n\nThe platform it is independent and we do not share your account information also the development goes very slow due to time constraint and not enough spare time. However, in the near future we would like to apply a new theme, simplify the links conversion process and offer more statistics for all our users.\n\nThis extension will convert any link page you are on, into a short URL, just by pressing the FIFO icon. \n\nUPDATES:\n 27/02/2016 - v1.2.1 - Updated API calls\n\n 22/02/2015 - v1.2 - New Logo\n                                - Removed alerts\n 21/02/2015 - v1.1 -  Security updates"
