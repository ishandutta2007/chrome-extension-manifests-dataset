It provides an easy way to select weapons randomly from your entire armory, across all characters and within your vault. With the click of a button, you can move pieces of gear to your active character making it easy to equip a random loadout between Crucible matches, or for that extra challenge in any Destiny activity.\n\nThis is a simple extension originally built for personal use, there are few bells and no whistles, but feel free to suggest bells and/or whistles and let me know when it breaks.\n\nThough this extension works through the official Bungie Gear Manager page, it is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Bungie."
