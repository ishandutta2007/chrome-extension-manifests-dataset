This extension creates its resizing charasteristic and put it in a useful javascript implementation that you can use finally.\n\nYou need to go through steps until you get a javascript code in return. You need to implement this script that you can download from https://github.com/gabordelarosa/iframatic.\n\nWhy would you need that? For many reasons you can't tell the content height of an iframe document. This could be for security reason or you simply can not inject code into that document hosted somewhere else. Communication protocolls may only work for modern browsers. External document may be hosted on server that forbids iframe communications. Or you don't wanna waist time and code on doing these things by yourself.\n\nThis extension works on both local and online contents.\n\nDornload implementation file:\nhttps://github.com/gabordelarosa/iframatic\n\nImplementation example:\nhttp://gabordelarosa.hu/_dev/iframatic/implementation-example/\n\nResoponsive iframe content : http://gabordelarosa.hu/_dev/iframatic/implementation-example/res2/"
