However, in the future, we plan to develop an additional feature that automatically closes ads on websites.\n\nThis feature aims to detect ads that appear when users visit websites and automatically close them when they finish. This will allow users to focus on content without the inconvenience of dealing with ads.\n\nFurthermore, users will have the option to enable or disable this feature according to their preferences. This flexibility allows users to choose whether or not to use this feature on specific websites.\n\nAs new features are added, users will be notified to receive the latest updates. We are committed to continuously improving SkipMaster to provide users with a more convenient web browsing experience.\n\nWhile this description is brief, SkipMaster's potential is limitless. User feedback is invaluable to us, and we will use it to develop a better product. Thank you for your support."
