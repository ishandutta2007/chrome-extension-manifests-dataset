This means it will remove all of the clutter like recently visited, Google search, Google doodles, account options, notifications, etc from the page. This will allow you to load the New Tab page much quicker. In addition, as mentioned above, it is made to work seamlessly with my original Rainbow Dash theme.\n\nThe awesome background was made by episcopi, but unfortunately, his account has been deactivated at this time, so I am unable to provide a link to his deviantArt."
