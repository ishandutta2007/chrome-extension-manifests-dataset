Choose what information about you and your browsing behavior is shared with brands in order to help them make better decisions to suit your needs. \n\nThe Crosswalk plugin allows you to self identify your demographics and then select what information is shared or sold to a brand. This user interface gives YOU control over your data. Based on what you select we then market that data to brands that want to better understand customers like you. And most importantly, never share any of your personally identifiable information! \n\nOur primary purpose is to take your data, combine it with data from like minded individuals and then find useful patterns in the data that we can sell to our clients for various use cases. In some cases, those reasons are simply to make your browsing experience better and more convenient. But this data can also be used to determine your browsing habits and preferences, price points you like to pay, what size you are and other personal information that is can then be used by brands and advertisers in determining how to best design, produce, market and sell you the right products. This cuts down on wasting time, money and creating an excess of product that ends up in a landfill. \n\nHere are a few common examples of what our clients pay us to help uncover from your tracked data: \n\n- What digital media you watch and listen to from video sites like YouTube and Netflix to help understand your content preferences. They can then advertise in shows you watch and on streaming platforms you use. \n- Your shopping behavior from online stores like Amazon and Target to understand different items you view and purchase, which helps our clients suggest other products you may want to buy.\n- Your behavior on search engines like Google to understand how you conduct research and the things you search for. This can help our clients include more relevant information on their products so that you don’t have to look for answers elsewhere, but it can also be used for advertising purposes.\n\nOverall we are tracking how you use your digital ecosystem of devices to help brands become smarter, create less waste of products you don’t want and give you a more seamless online experience. \n\nThe information we track is both sold raw and analyzed to a wide range of clients in a number of different sectors based on what you allow. \n\nIn addition to the uses described above, we may collect and use personal information for the following purposes:\n- For our business activities, including to operate our services and to provide our clients with the features and functionality of our service\n- To help our clients make better strategic, design, product, financial and marketing decisions, such as to better understand how to market to you or offer you with information and updates on our products or services we think that you may be interested in. \n\nWhile we may use your personal information in this manner, please note that we do not use user content to serve you ads nor do we sell your PII to anyone to do either. Additionally, nothing is used for financial, creditworthiness assessment or ever identifying you and your together. \n\nFor analytics and research purposes to enforce our Terms of Service, to resolve disputes, to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights, and to protect our business interests and the interests and rights of you, our clients and other third parties or to comply with contractual legal obligations and requirements and to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide personal information; and for any other lawful purpose.\n\nTo know more about us, please consult our Website, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy."
