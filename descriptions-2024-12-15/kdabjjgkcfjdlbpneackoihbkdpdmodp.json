Outliner is here to help.\n\n\nHow to use\n----\n\n1. Click the Outliner button beside your address bar to activate it. You will see a box coming from left with the outline in it.\n2. Click on any of the headings in the outline to jump to the corresponding section on the page.\n3. Click the cross button on the bottom left to close the outline.\n\n\nPrivacy\n----\n\nOutliner needs access to \"your data on all websites\" and \"your tabs and browsing activity\" in order to inject the outline into your tabs. It does not track your data or activity in any way.\n\n\nFeedback\n----\n\nIf you discover that Outliner does not work well in some pages, please send me the link, and I'll try my best to fix that ;)\n\nAny feedback is welcomed, but if you expect my response (and you probably do), please post them on the feedback page or on GitHub, because I cannot respond to your web store review in any way!\n\n\nLicense\n----\n\nOutliner is released under the MIT license.\nhttps://github.com/scottcheng/outliner"
