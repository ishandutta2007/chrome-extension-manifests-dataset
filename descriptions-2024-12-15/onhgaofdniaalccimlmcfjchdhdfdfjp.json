It's intended use is only for the \"My Applets\" page on IFTTT. Folders can be created with a name, a list of the applet IDs that will be contained in that folder, and a color just to spice it up. This is a side project developed in the span of a few hours, so there may be some issues. I'll try to maintain it as best I can and I'm open to new suggestions."
