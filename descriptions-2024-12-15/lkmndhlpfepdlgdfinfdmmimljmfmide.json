You always see it reported in the more sensationalist media outlets: 'People outraged about...', followed by whatever decision a company has made this week. If you read the article, it's pretty much always a scant handful of people -- two at most -- who have managed to whip up a storm in a teacup, usually about nothing at all. The best advice I every heard when it comes to keeping things like this in perspective is to imagine that the plural noun in phrases like this -- you know, 'Scientists now think that...' or 'People are claiming that...' or 'Mothers all around the country are outraged by...' -- can be replaced by 'Two dudes in Iowa'. \n\n> 'Two dudes in Iowa now think that global warming might be overblown' is not a news story.\n\nby u/Portarossa\n\n\nThe extension runs a script over the 15 top news websites that replaces words such as \"Expert\" / \"People\" / \"Protestors\" / etc with \"Two Dudes in Iowa\". \n\nThe extension icon can also be clicked to open a popup that allows toggling the script to run over the body of the article as well (set on by default).\n\nThe goal is to tone down the sensationalism often found in these news articles."
