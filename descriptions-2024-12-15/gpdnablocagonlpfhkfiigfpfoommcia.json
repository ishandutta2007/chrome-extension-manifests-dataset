Simply open a new tab and start writing. Structure your text with markdown syntax.\n\nTo value your privacy all your input is stored locally in your chromes cache. So don't worry, no one is listening.*\n\n* This also means there is no option to sync your thoughts with other computers or create a backup. Once you delete a page its gone. Keep that in mind."
