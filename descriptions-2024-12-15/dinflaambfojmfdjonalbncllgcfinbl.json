You may have to use mobile selfcare app more often due to this reason. \nPortal won't show the daytime data, nighttime data separately, have to login more often, takes too much time ... are some of the problems.\n\n💡💡 SLT USAGE METER extension allows you to:\n\n👉 Compatible with the latest SLT server update.\n👉 Keep track of all data bundles separately,\n👉 Keep track of peak and off-peak time data separately.\n👉 Conveniently check data balance while browsing without using mobile phones.\n👉 Animated progress bar is showing current usage.\n👉 Displays current daily usage, recommended daily usage and daily usage to be maintained for the rest of the month.\n👉 Shows data consume percentage vise.\n👉 Display VAS data bundles.\n👉 Different colors for different stages of the progress bar - (Safe / Warning / Danger)\n👉 Inbuilt login function and Logout anytime you want.\n\n\nNOTE: 📌\n- So far this extension accurately works only for the broadband packages which will renew on the 1st of each month. Other broadband users may experience inaccurate values in past, recommended and future data usages. \n- This won't have the support for anytime data bundles for now.\n- If the extension doesn't load the usage details after longer inactive period (~ 1 month), logging-out and login again will fix it.\nUpdate will be released soon with fixes. \n\n📝 Also make sure you have access to the latest SLT Mobitel Broadband portal site (https://myslt.slt.lk/) and use those credentials when login. 📝\n\n\n** We do not collect any personal data **\n\nAny suggestions, feedbacks or issues are welcomed.\n\n> Please be aware that this is NOT an official product of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC and has no affiliation with the company."
