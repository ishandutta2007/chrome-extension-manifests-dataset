Therefore it is the perfect companion when you are trying to find the exact pixel where your responsive websites break.\n\nHow to use\nThese are the default settings, you can change them in \"Window\" > \"Extensions\", then scroll down to the bottom and to the right you will find \"Keyboard Shortcuts\".\nPlease note: Since Chrome version 29 these are not set by default anymore! You now have to set them manually when you install the extension.\n\nAlt + Left Arrow: Decrease the width of the window by 1px\nAlt + Right Arrow: Increase the width of the window by 1px\n(Add Shift to any of the combinations to change it by 10px)\n\nBreakpoint also has the ability to change the height of the browser window, but you have to manually activate it in \"Window\" > \"Extensions\" > \"Keyboard Shortcuts\".\n\nWhen you find the break point you are looking for the tiny icon in the toolbar will tell you the exact size of you browser window."
