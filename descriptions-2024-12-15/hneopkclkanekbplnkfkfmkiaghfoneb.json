Normally, when you post a video using the YouTube share function, the video information and thumbnail are shared, but the video itself cannot be shared. However, there are many cases where you want to post a video to spread the attractiveness of the video. Until now, I had to download the video first and then upload it manually to X. This extension makes it easy to do so. With this extension, you can now share your favorite videos with ease.\n\nHow to use PYTV\n\n1. open the page of the YouTube video you want to post\n2. click the PYTV icon in the extension list to display the pop-up window\n3. (optional) Add your post text. If left empty, PYTV uses the standard YouTube caption.\n4. Click the \"Post Video\" button\n    4-1. (first time only) You will be redirected to the verification page for posting to X (formerly Twitter)\n    4-2. (first time only) After authentication, you will be redirected to the callback page and \"Authentication Succeeded\" will be displayed\n    4-3. (first time only) Please do the action [1~4] again, and then you can post YouTube video without authentication.\n\nPosting takes 1~2 minutes. You can close the pop-up window at any time during this time."
