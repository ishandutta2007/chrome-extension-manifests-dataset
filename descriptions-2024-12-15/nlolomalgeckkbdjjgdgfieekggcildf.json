It works completely offline. It is very similar to BC command line calculator in a sense that there are no buttons (like in XCalc) but you simply type expression you want to evaluate. Tc use JS for evaluation so you can use almost any valid JS code. You can write your own library of functions. You can open it in popup or in multiple tabs. There is also extensive offline help included. There are over 60 built in functions.\n\nThis is extension version. Tc is also available as Chrome packaged app (for chromebooks)."
