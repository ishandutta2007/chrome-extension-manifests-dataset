You sit down to work and before you know it you're up to your eyeballs in cat videos and Star Wars memes.\n\nFocus will block your go-to time-wasting sites, replacing them with a gentle reminder to get on with your work. It'll also sync itself across any Chrome browser you log into.\n\nWhen you need a break, just toggle Focus off and get your procrastination fix.\n\nWHAT IT DOESN'T DO\n\nI'm a simple person and I like simple software. With that in mind there are tons of features that I chose not to add, including:\n\n• Tracking of your productive/unproductive time.\n• Timers and scheduling to automatically enable or disable the extension.\n• Complex rules for managing the URLs you block.\n\nIf you're after something with all the bells and whistles, then this isn't the extension for you. If you like clean, easy-to-use software, then give it a try."
