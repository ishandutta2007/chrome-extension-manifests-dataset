No more new tabs.\n\nIf you decide that you want to visit the d.tech Family Portal once in a while, there's an option to make a one-off visit in the settings. You don't need to remove the extension just for that.\n\nThis extension, while built by the CanvasCBL team (Sam Mendelson), sends no information to CanvasCBL. This extension is open-source, too-- check out the code at go.canvascbl.com/canvas-fixer/repo."
