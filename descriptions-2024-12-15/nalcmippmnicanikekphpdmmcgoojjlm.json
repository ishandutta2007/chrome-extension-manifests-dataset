The app makes listening to everything on your screen effortless with a functional smooth design and customizable options as a selection of male and female voices, voice pitch and reading speed. \n\nSpoken text has several advantages over reading. The most obvious one is the option to multitask as your eyes and hands are free, but also it is considered that it can enhance comprehension. Listening is also great for those with disabilities or disadvantages that make reading either impossible or extremely difficult."
