You can change the speed of any HTML5 video (ie. youtube, netflix, reddit, twitter, etc), with much more control than websites typically offer.\n\nThis fork has mouse-scrolling to change speed - hold shift and use the scroll wheel.\nThis fork also includes unmerged patches to the settings UI which gives it a modern dark theme as well as breaking changes to the settings menu which allow for more fine-grained handling of keyboard input, and some fixes for specific websites such as netflix and reddit.\n\nBecause I have seen how backwards compatability left crusty code in the original versions for multiple years while I rewrote large sections of it, I will make no promises about this extension working between versions. A complete reinstall of the extension may be (but probably will not be) required on every update, so I can iterate more quickly and correctly."
