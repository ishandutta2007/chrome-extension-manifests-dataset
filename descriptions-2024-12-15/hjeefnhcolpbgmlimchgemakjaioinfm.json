Other extensions were running on Manifest v2 that haven't been updated in years, which meant it wouldn't be supported if Google decided to not allow activation of older manifest versions. One extension specifically was using a dated framework with known security flaws, which is when we decided to build something from scratch. Since it's no longer possible to run extensions locally, we decided to share our work with the public.\n\nNote: We use the storage permission to store your settings, we use this data to override your new tab. While this data is only stored locally, your browser, the third party libraries, websites you enter, along with any external links within the extension might collect data, so be sure to check their privacy policy."
