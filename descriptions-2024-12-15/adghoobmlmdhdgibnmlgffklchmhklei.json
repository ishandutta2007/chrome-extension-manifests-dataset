Users can now make more informed booking decisions by comparing itineraries by the likelihood of a delay, cancellation, or missed connection.\n\nThis version of the extension currently only works with SAP Concur's online booking tool. The extension requires you to have a Lumo account, and an SAP Concur account likely provided through your employer. If you created a Lumo account through your employer, the data you can see in the extension may be restricted or customized."
