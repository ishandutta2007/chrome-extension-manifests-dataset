But you are having the most challenging time finding it. Or worse — it is buried in the mountain of bookmarks you have, half of which are cute pet videos.\n\nWhether you are looking to dig up an old tidbit of information you previously found or are struggling to find an answer to a new question or two, with Flowpedia, you can find that answer sooner than later.\n\nThis extension uses Google search operators to find the answer to your question(s) faster than ever before. Leaving you more time to design in Figma, build in Webflow, code away in Visual Studio Code, find your next client, and everything else! Or — use the extra time to take a well-deserved nap because we all need one sometimes.\n\nBring that Webflow University video or well-written Webflow Blog article up. You know the one! That video or blog post which left you smiling ear to ear, and further empowered you to build incredible experiences through the power of visual development.\n\nTrack down that helpful answer from Vincent Bidaux, Nelson Abalos Jr. aka Pixel Geek, among countless others in the Webflow Forum.\n\nFind your favourite cloneable from Timothy Ricks (T.RICKS), Tyler Hughey (tycreated), Flowbase, and other prominent creators from Made in Webflow.\n\n——————\n\nThis is an independently developed Chrome Extension by Evil Twins Studio, made available for free on the Chrome Web Store solely for non-commercial purposes.
