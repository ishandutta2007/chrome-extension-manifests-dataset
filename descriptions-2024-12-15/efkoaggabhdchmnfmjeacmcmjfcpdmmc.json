You click a button and we create a pre-configured virtual desktop on our servers. Then we stream down video of your software running on this virtual desktop to your browser, and stream up your mouse clicks and keyboard strokes so you can interact with it. In full-screen mode and at 4G speeds, it feels no different then using a normal computer. Everything happens in the browser, so it works exactly the same across Mac, Linux, PC or Chromebooks. \n\nOnce this virtual desktop running your software is created, you can drag and drop files into it, share a URL with others(to collaborate like Gdocs), make multiple copies of it, arrange it into teams and projects, open different desktops in different tabs, install more software in a click from the Boxware Store, and resize RAM/CPUs/GPUs according to your needs. \n\nWere currently in product beta, and would love it if you made the time to tell us what we could improve with Boxware. Drop us a mail at : support@boxware.io"
