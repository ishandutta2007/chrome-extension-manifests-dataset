It allows you to select from a number of different stats that aren't accessible on the site. For example, OPS, wRC+, FIP, etc. The stats display the same way the current stats do, making it easy to compare players. There is also color coding functionality to make comparisons even easier.\n\n\n[ NOTES ]\n\n- By clicking on the symbol of the extension while on the ESPN Fantasy Baseball page (a team page or the players page), you can select which stats you want to show. They will be ordered in the order which you select them, so if you want a specific order, unselect all and reselect in the desired order. This may be a bit buggy the first time you use it, you may have to reload and reselect your options a few times.\n\n- Using 2023 season stats for the first 2 weeks of the season. Around mid-April, I'll be switching over to the ongoing 2024 season. Stats will update every day around 4 am EST.\n\n- The \"show stats\" dropdown will not affect the advanced stats. These are the \"last 7 days,\" \"2022 stats,\" etc. options. The advanced stats are full year stats no matter which option is selected. Stats will only show on the \"Stats\" tab.\n\n- Opponent rank is based on fantasy points, calculated with ESPN's standard scoring. Even in non-points leagues, this should still accurately represent how difficult an opponent is. Obviously, fantasy players (regardless of the league type) care about more than just runs allowed/scored, so I feel that points is a sufficient way to determine how good or bad a pitching or hitting staff is. I am of course open to all suggestions.\n\n- The data is retrieved from various sources using a player's name. Sometimes, there are differences in the ESPN name and the source's name (Ronald Acuna vs Ronald Acuna Jr.). Because of this, some players may not have data. Correcting this is a very easy fix, but I don't have time to go and look for every single player who is missing data. If you find a player without data, just send a quick email and I will correct it promptly. I'll also be doing my best to update as many players as I can manually before opening day.\n\n- When in doubt, refresh the page and wait a few seconds. When switching pages too quickly, you may need to reload when you reach the desired page. Also, looking ahead dates may mess up the alignment of the stats. Simply refresh once you are on the date and the columns should realign. Moving players around in your lineup will do the same. Just refresh after.\n\n\n[ BUGS/SUGGESTIONS ]\n\nPlease use email or the discord to report bugs or suggest new features\nespnfbas.contact@gmail.com \nhttps://discord.com/invite/G3HcYVdFSg"
