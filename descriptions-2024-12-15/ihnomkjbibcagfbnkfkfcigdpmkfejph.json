This avoids the need to \"send the link to choosy\" and deal with the browser prompt. Instead, it opens it immediately, which allows Choosy to use the advanced link rules you've setup.\n\nFor instance, \"open all atlassian links with the JIRA for Mac application\" as a rule in the Choosy app.\n\nChoosy App: https://www.choosyosx.com/"
