This extension fixes that!\n\nAfter installing this extension, when looking at an article in list view, simply press ; and it will open in a new preview window. Any additional articles will be opened in the same preview window. This is perfect for large or multiple monitors and offers you a full \"reading pane\" for your articles.\n\nWant to change your shortcut key? Simply visit the options page.\n\nNote: This extension is but a few line changes from Aaron Saray's awesome feedlybackgroundtab extension. This workflow is something I have sought for a long time, but I wouldn't have been able to do if Aaron hadn't open sourced and documented his extension so well."
