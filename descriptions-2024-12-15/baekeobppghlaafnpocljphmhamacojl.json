I am currently working on finding a solution to address this issue.\n\nBy utilizing your microphone, you can communicate with the extension, and it will transcribe your speech into text format.\n\nThis version leverages the Speech Recognition API of the Browser, resulting in remarkable speed and reasonably accurate outcomes.\n\nFor the upcoming release, I am excited to incorporate the Whisper API from OpenAI, as it promises significantly improved voice recognition capabilities.\n\nMoreover, in the version that follows, I will integrate a superior text-to-speech feature with a more pleasant and soothing voice. My aim is to create an experience that leaves users feeling relaxed and content while interacting with the system, moving away from the mundane default voice."
