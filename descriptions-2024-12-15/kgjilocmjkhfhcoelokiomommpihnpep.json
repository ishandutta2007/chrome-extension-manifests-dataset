Keep it simple or take it to the next level - advanced data management with unique type, tagging, templating and filtering features.\n\nTrackers - This unique templating feature in Beyondpad will allow you to create your own forms for tracking things that are important to you. Track your time spent on a project, expenses, fitness and much more.\n\nTags - Itâ€™s much more that usual #tags. In Beyondpad you can tag notes and trackers, and even tag other tags and create folder like structure for neat filtering magic. Even notes can become tags and you can link to them. Tags have plenty of unique features to explore, you should check them out.\n\nBoards and lists - More natural way for managing related notes like to-do lists or project tasks. Lists are set of tags that act as filters. By drag notes across lists notes will change their tags accordingly.\n\nNotes - Text notes, checklists, links, numbers and timers - we have them! In trackers Beyondpad also gives you combo boxes and drop downs. More items to come like image, date, calendar and map."
