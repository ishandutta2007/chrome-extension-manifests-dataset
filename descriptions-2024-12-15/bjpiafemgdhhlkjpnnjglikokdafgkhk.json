This site is meant to help people spot out erroneous logic so that similar arguments will not be made in the future. You can use Blather to assign logical fallacies to and/or highlight contradictions that pundits on Twitter have made.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhen you are viewing a page in chrome that is of a tweet, the Blather icon will appear blue and you can choose to either assign a fallacy to the current tweet or view fallacies that have already been assigned to it. Once the fallacy has been assigned, you can generate a meme of it for download. \n\nWhat is the purpose of Blather?\n\nThis project is meant to combat partisanship and make peoples' bullshit detectors better so that they're less likely to be conned in the future. We recognize that partisanship is a disease and we hope to make the inconsistencies of ideological dogma more apparent by documenting it."
