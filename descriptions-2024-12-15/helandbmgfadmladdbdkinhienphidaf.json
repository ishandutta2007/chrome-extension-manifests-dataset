On top of what PowerSchool tells you about your grades, you can see other helpful information such as your GPA, a more detailed grade, how many points you have in a class, how many points you will need to improve your grade, ther average percentage for each assignment, and more.\n\n\nAbout: \nI decided to create this extension because I thought that PowerSchool seemed very old and lacked some extremly useful details about your grades. I did not want to have to waste my time trying to manually calculate it. This extension is independently developed by me and was inspired by me and my peers."
