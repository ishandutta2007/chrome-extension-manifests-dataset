This extension achieves its optimising function by recycling tabs that are already open with the same URL. When you try to open a tab that is already open in your browser, TabRecycle recognises the duplicate URL and, instead of opening a new tab, it brings you back to the one already opened, “recycling” it. As a consequence, TabRecycle significantly reduces the number of tabs open and optimizes both your work and the performance of your device.\n \nFeatures:\n-       Shows the number of recycled tabs\n-       You can pin the extension\n-       You can enable/disabled the extension with one click\n-       List of multiple opened URLs (in Option menu)"
