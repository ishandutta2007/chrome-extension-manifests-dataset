Mathematicians, academics and scientists are often concerned with how a set of random numbers they generate using Python or other programming languages aren't truly random, but are a result of just very complex mathematical functions. Here comes TruRand, which helps people generate their own random numbers, using the literally their fingertips. A human beings' mouse movements are know to be \"truly\" random, and this extension leverages just that to track a users mouse movements and get the X and Y co-ordinates of their cursor in a CSV file. The user also has the option to generate a specific number of random numbers that they would want and as soon as those many numbers are generated, the CSV will be downloaded by itself.\nUsers working/studying the fields of network security/pure sciences/mathematics are most likely to benefit from the true random behavior of the set of numbers they can generate."
