Me too! I kantbotha to deal with it and neither should you. This extension adds quality-of-life improvements to the Kantata OX experience.\n\nKantbotha adds three quality of life improvements to Kantata:\n1. Responsive width for task titles in the new task tracker.\nFixes the new task tracker by making the task titles expand with the screen, just like the old task tracker! It also removes that tiny bit of worthless padding between the header and task table. You may not notice this unless you have an ultrawide monitor.\n2. Resizable task side panel.\nYou can drag the left edge of the task side panel with your mouse to make it any size you want!\n3. Public mode.\nHide private messages and time sheets from the project/workspace page. Toggle available on the menu bar above the Activity Feed and side panel Activities. Now you can share your screen without exposing any private information!\n4. Highlight task tracker rows when hovering over them.\n\n!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!\nYou MUST grant ALL permissions to Kantbotha after installing. Kantbotha may not request these permissions automatically. You must go into your extension settings, manage the Kantbotha extension, and toggle all of the permissions on.\n\nNot being able to read task titles even though my screen is IMAX size was killing me. Like, I couldn't even use the new task tracker at all because of it. I've submitted feedback on this to Kantata multiple times to no avail. No more!\n\nMaybe I'll add other improvements. Maybe I won't. I don't really know.\n\nFeel free to leave ideas/requests in the comments! I probably won't do any of them because I typically have better things to do and don't get paid for this, but who knows. At the very least, I'd enjoy reading them."
