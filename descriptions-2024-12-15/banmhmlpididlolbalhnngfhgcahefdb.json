Well now you can avoid the pain with DarkSheet, a dark mode extension for SmartSheet.\n\nIts come to my attention that this app is receiving a lot of attention, and some of you would like some improvements. I created this app as a very small one off project, and unfortunately front end web development no longer aligns with my personal interests or career trajectory. \n\nConsidering this, and the fact that I do not actually have a SmartSheet license, please consider making a small donation at the link below if you would like improvements made to this project. \n\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/jacobthomas\n\nThank you!"
