As the number of services requiring passwords increases so does the need for a way to manage multiple passwords. However remembering different passwords for your email, bank account, and social media account can be an impossible task and when some services require you to change your password every 6 months it becomes even more of an issue. So how do you manage all these passwords? Well you could use a common and unsecured password across all your accounts and then have to change all your passwords if your password gets stolen and hope you changed them all, or you can use Password Assistant!\n\nWith Password Assistant you can create unique passwords for each of your accounts, and can access these passwords across multiple devices! \n\nSo what makes Password Assistant different from other password management software? Most password managers randomly generate a password and then store it on your device. While this creates a password that is hard to figure out for someone who wants to steal your password, it also creates a password that you can not access from anywhere but that device but if that device is lost or breaks you lose all of your passwords. This is where Password Assistant comes in. With Password Assistant a password is generated from a password or phrase, a 4-digit pin, and other settings you can choose from. This allows you to have access to your passwords on any device that has Password Assistant installed! But now you are thinking I still have to remember multiple passwords, but you are wrong. Password Assistant uses what we call modifiers, which you can create for each password you want. With the modifiers you can use the same password and 4-digit code for each password and still get different passwords generated for each one!\n\nDownload Password Assistant today and start taking steps to increase your online security!\n\nBy installing and using this app you agree with the Terms of Service:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/p-assistant-terms-of-service/home"
