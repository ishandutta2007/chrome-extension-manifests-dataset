A coffee will be just fine! :D\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>> LET'S GO DARK! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nWorks with Calendar's DARK MODE too! The extension AUTOMATICALLY detects dark mode and renders in a dark fashion the colours you chose! Yay! :)\n\nChoose custom colours FOR EACH of your week's days! Those days will be coloured with your custom background colours, finally highlighting your week in ALL the \"views\" of the NEW version of Google Calendar web pages (2018 and further)! If you prefer NOT to highlight a day, simply leave it WHITE.\nAt first install, you will be automatically redirected to options page, where you will have to choose your Google Calendar's page language (MANDATORY), and the colours for all your days. In OPTIONS page you can now donate me a coffee, too! :)\nNOTE: sometimes while working it could stop highlighting the weekend columns; in that case, try to click on an empty space on the calendar or press F5 (refresh page) and the weekend columns will be correctly light up again!\n\nChangelog at:\nhttps://theblackbird.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GCWH_Changelog.txt"
