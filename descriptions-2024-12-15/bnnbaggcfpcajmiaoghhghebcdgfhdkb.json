Let alone when you don’t understand the very words used to describe it. Enter: The Thesaurus – part dinosaur, part Google Chrome plug-in – this creature knows a thing or two about science and extinction. It can scan any page about anthropogenic climate change then put it into layman’s terms for you. Don’t know what ‘anthropogenic’ means? Looks like you need to ask The Thesaurus.  \n\nHere's how to use Thesaurus Rex: \n\nStep 1. Make sure you've added the Thesaurus Rex Chrome extension to your Chrome browser, and have pinned it to your Chrome toolbar. If you haven't added it yet, there is a button to \"Add to Chrome\" on this page. \n\nStep 2. Visit any page on the internet about climate change. Like this one for example: (insert link here – like maybe the UNDP white paper/policies?) \n\nStep 3. Once the page is loaded, open up Thesaurus Rex by clicking the Thesaurus Rex icon in your Chrome toolbar, then press the \"Uncomplicate this page\" button. \n\nStep 4. If Thesaurus Rex finds any climate terms on the page, he’ll highlight them in green. \nSimply click on these green words to see the uncompleted explanation."
