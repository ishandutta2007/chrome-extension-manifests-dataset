In Firefox (and presumably elsewhere) I use [mhart/aws4fetch](https://github.com/mhart/aws4fetch) to handle all heavy lifting. This has the perk of using the browser's WebCrypto API, which should be insanely faster. In Chrome I use [mhart/aws4](https://github.com/mhart/aws4) because Chrome still has zero async support for webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders.\n- This extension triggers on all AWS services instead of filtering for one.\n- Instance Profile credentials aren't supported as I have no use for them but could be added fairly trivially.\n- Chrome/Firefox/Opera support."
