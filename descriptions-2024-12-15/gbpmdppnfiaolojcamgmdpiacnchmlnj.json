You can even get a \"picture\" of the snippet and share it as an image on Twitter or Instagram. \n\nAnd the best part? \n\nIt's totally free...\n\nYou just need a GitHub account to create and manage up to 3000+ gists.\n\nAs you may already know, other developers can star, follow and comment on the stuff you publish there so you can build a strong community and a following around your passion for coding.\n\nThanks to Code Aficionado, all this is now way easier because there is no need to switch tabs or disrupt your flow in other ways. Just click the extension icon, paste the snippet and submit it. \n\nYou can start sharing it right away or leave that part for later.   \n\n \nWhat are the main features?\n\n- Easy Gist Creation -  Click the icon and paste the code snippet you want to share\n\n- Easy Code Sharing - Copy the link or the embedding code of the newly-created gist\n\n- Code Snippet Image - You can get an image of your code and share it on Twitter\n\n- Public & Secrets Gists - Make them public or show them only to people you choose\n\nAnd that's just the beginning...\n\nI plan to keep adding a lot of new features and updates. Most of them will remain free for everybody, so there is no good reason not to try the extension. \n\nSharing good code and creating gists are now just a click away..."
