You can click any sentence to play it.\n\nHowever, you can not easily stop the play and repeat the sentence. To do that, you will have to scroll all the way to the top of the page and click the Ted Player to pause. This back and forth is very inconvenient.\n\nThis Chrome Extension solved that problem by making the Ted Player sticky during page scroll, allowing you to play and pause nicely.\n\nTo activate it:\n\n1, Click extension icon and click \"Turn on\" button in the popup ui\n2, Click any text to listen to the speaker, and repeat to practice\n3, Click the Ted Video player to stop\n4, Click the same text to repeat"
