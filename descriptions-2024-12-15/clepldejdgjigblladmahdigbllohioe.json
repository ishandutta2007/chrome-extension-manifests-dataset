PlayerTube has a good amount of features that can be either enabled or disabled from its menu.\nMore than that, users can customize the style of their player and share it across the web for others to use.\n\nLatest update (v1.8):\nThis update shouldn't have taken so long, but I've working on other stuff recently!!\n * Renamed the 2012 theme to 2013 & 2011 to 2012 because of this image (that's new to me).\n * Change of placement for the Change year of Player settings option.\n * Fixed the \"TrustedTypes\" issue with the resize script.\n * Added Project V3 support, somewhat. Only the 2013 & 2012 theme & custom themes are supported. As of currently. There is no manual configuration needed for this extension.\n * Added #28 -- \"[ Feature Request ] add a toggle for the custom loading icon\" under Toggle the loading spinner [...].\n * A lot of CSS improvements."
