Presenting the information that you need to keep track of all the work you're doing. Hourly takes those boring long lists of information and combines them with something amazing. That's right. Hourly gives you the possibility to keep track of how much you can afford something you love. Like how many bottles of wine that shitty task you've been at all week has provided for you.\n\nIt's not only easy to use - but it's also lovely to look at. Hourly allows you not only to change your hourly rate - but also what the price of an item is. With icons from Line Awesome and eight items of choice:\n\nHamburgers üçî\nBeers üçª\nBottles of wine üç∑\nCookies üç™\nGas ‚õΩ\nApples üçé\nCoffees ‚òï\nGames üéÆ\n\nYou'll end up with something that makes Toggl a lot more than just a site where you enter your work tasks.\n\nHourly is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Toggl, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates. The official Toggl website can be found at https://toggl.com/."
