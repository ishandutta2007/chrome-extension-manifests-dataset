Whether you're a QA engineer, developer, researcher or someone who just likes having a lot of tabs open you know how hard it can be to keep track of your tabs. Tabby tries to address this problem by allowing you to add customizable labels to each tab in order to add some clarity to the chaos. You can customize the label text, icon, color and position to fit your individual use case. We even update the tab favicon with your selected icon to help you determine context at a glance."
