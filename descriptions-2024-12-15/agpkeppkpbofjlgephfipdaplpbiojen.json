These images are small, but their format is not widely recognized yet.\nYou can open WebP, BPG, JXR image files to view from your computer or your Google Drive.\nSupports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, IE11...\n\nWebP: WebP is an image format employing both lossy and lossless compression. It is currently developed by Google, based on technology acquired with the purchase of On2 Technologies.\n\nBPG: Better Portable Graphics (BPG) is a file format for coding digital images. Its purpose is to be a more compression-efficient replacement for the JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue. It is based on the intra-frame encoding of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) video compression standard.\n\nJXR: JPEG XR (abbr. for JPEG extended range) is a still-image compression standard and file format for continuous tone photographic images, based on technology originally developed and patented by Microsoft under the name HD Photo (formerly Windows Media Photo)."
