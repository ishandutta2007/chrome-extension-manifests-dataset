This involves manually copying the URL and making subsequent changes to reach the desired destination. Over time, navigating through AEM using this manual approach consumes a significant amount of unnecessary time.\n\nThe AEM Chrome Extension streamlines this process, saving you time by providing easy navigation within AEM—from the Touch UI Editor, Classic UI Editor, Page Properties, and CRX/DE Lite—with a single click on a button or hotkey! This tool allows you to efficiently navigate through the AEM console, ultimately saving you considerable time in the long run.\n\nMain Features:\n+ Dynamic Quick Links\nFrom any page under /content/* you can swiftly and quickly navigate to Touch UI Editor, Classic UI Editor, Page Properties, Disabled Mode, Debug Clientlibs Mode, and CRX/DE Lite.
