The extension is now available on four different streaming platforms: Netflix, YouTube, iQIYI (iq.com) and Rakuten VIki (viki.com). Every platform has some free features and some premium features. For a detailed pricing comparison, please visit swapbrain.com . In the popup, there is a button to activate PinyinTube, as well as a button to purchase the premium version. \n\nIn this new version, we added a free feature to automatically generate subtitle for any audio streams from all websites. This is particularly useful for news channels and podcasts where there are no provided subtitle. To activate this feature, toggle on the \"Automatic Video Subtitles\" in the pop-up. Then on the browser Translation window, click on CC to choose the languages for translating the subtitles.\n\nFor movies channels with provided subtitles, you can Toggle on Activate PinyinTube to translate the current subtitle to a second language. To activate more free features, please sign on to our Forum by submitting your email address on the popup, then toggle activate button. Once activated, you will see a few buttons on the right edge of the videos. The Seek Back button goes backward sentence-by-sentence, helping you to repeat the actor's voice. The Dual Subtitle helps display a second subtitle that translates the current subtitle to your native language. When you turn on Chinese subtitle, the Pinyin pronunciation will also appear, helping you to read Chinese. Especially, there is a Voice Record button that works only for the Premium version, helping you to record your voice to compare with the actor's voice. The Seek Forward button goes forward by five seconds. Note, if the buttons do not work, please try refreshing the browser."
