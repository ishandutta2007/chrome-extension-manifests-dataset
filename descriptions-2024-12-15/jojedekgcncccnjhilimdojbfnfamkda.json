That's why I built this extension, to save time.\n\nHow to use:\nSelect any text and then right-click on the selection. You'll see the \"Search with Brave\" option in the context menu, which when clicked, opens Brave search results in a new tab.\n\nWhy to use:\nBrave claims their search engine is built on top of an independent index, and doesn't track users, their searches, or their clicks.\n\nGive it a try now and see the advantages for yourself."
