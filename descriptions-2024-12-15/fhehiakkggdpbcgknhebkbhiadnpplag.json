GitHub issues does not have a UI for this, but you can craft a URL to show you a list of all issues assigned to a particular user.\n\nThis extension crafts these URLs for you by turning your \"Assigned to me\" filter link into a dropdown of \"Assigned to\" links for each user of your project.\n\n## Changelog\n1.4: fixes to extension regarding manifest and changes to github DOM\n1.3: fix an incorrect filename resulting in a bad install.\n1.2: re-apply our changes after an XHR (which github tends to use a lot)\n1.1: fixed issue where elements were added even if we didn't have a valid list of users to operate upon."
