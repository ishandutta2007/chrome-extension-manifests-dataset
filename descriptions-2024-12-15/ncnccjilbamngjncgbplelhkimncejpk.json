The tool can be toggled on and off and while on it will add a colorful outline to any image that has an alpha layer with full opacity, meaning that there is a transparent background around the object of an image. \n\nIt is hard to tell what images are transparent or not just by looking. Transparency is often showcased by a checkered background, white, grey or black, therefore its impossible to tell wether the background is part of the image or not. This tool exists to help with that problem.\n\nUse this extension when looking for images to place on top of other content where you don't want the image to be rectangular, and you want the image content to blend in to another context."
