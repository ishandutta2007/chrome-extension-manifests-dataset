It keeps track of all the web pages you visit so you can easily re-find them later. It's like your own personal Google -- a search engine for all the webpages you've seen. Also available as a native OS X application.\n\nLearn more at http://fetching.io\n\nSaves Everything\n--------------------\nFetching saves the full content of the web pages you visit exactly as you see them so you can search on what you remember -- not on what happens to be public. View your cached page copies at any time.\n\nPowerful Search\n--------------------\nSophisticated search ensures you always find what you're looking for, even if you only remember a few keywords. Natural language processing ensures you get results even when you can't be precise.\n\nSophisticated Filters\n-----------------------\nSlice and dice your data like a samurai. Filter your results by domain, time, body, title, notes and tags.\n\nAutomatic\n------------\nFetching is fully automatic via a small browser plug-in that runs in the background. Just like your browser history -- only better. You don't need to do anything to keep track of everything.\n\nComplete Privacy Control\n-----------------------------\nFetching is fully disabled in private and incognito modes and the extension can be turned off at any time. Rich filtering by domain and regular expression lets you blacklist any site.\n\nTags and Notes  New\n------------------------\nTag like a pro including auto-complete and keep notes on important sites. Easily search and filter on both.\n\nQuick and Simple UI\n-----------------------\nFetching uses reactive technology, responding immediately as you search and add content. A clean user interface gets you quickly to your goal then gets out of the way.\n\nBookmarks\n-------------\nJust like mom used to make. You can bookmark / favorite any site directly from your browser without leaving the page you're reading. Easily filter and search your saved sites later."
