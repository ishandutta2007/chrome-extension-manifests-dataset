This pulls the last 12 uploaded videos, excluding \"shorts\", removes the videos with the highest and lowest view count, and then calculates the average views, likes, and comments for the remaining 10 videos.\n\nThe second calculation is the \"Last 90 Days Stat Calc\".  This grabs all the uploaded videos, excluding \"shorts\", that are between 15 and 90 days old, and then calculates the average views, likes, and comments."
