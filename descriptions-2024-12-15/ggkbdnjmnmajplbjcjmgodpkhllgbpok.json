The camera and microphone are turned off prior to joining, to prevent any invasion of privacy. The extension keeps track of the day, allowing you to enter your entire week's schedule all at once for future use. Eight meets are able to be entered per day. \n\nIn the event that the google meet has not started, the extension will attempt to join again in about twenty seconds, and will keep doing this until it is able to successfully enter or if the page is closed by the user immediately after the extension opens it. \n\nUser data is stored locally on the user's computer.\n\nGoogle Meet is a trademark of Google Inc.
