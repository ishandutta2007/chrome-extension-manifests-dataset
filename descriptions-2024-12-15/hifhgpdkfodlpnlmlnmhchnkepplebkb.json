Tamper Chrome will continue to work but it's suggested you move to tamper.dev for a better experience.\n\nTo use it, refresh the website and look at the developer tools (left-click -> inspect element). Tamper Chrome will appear in a new tab. See the tutorial here: https://github.com/google/tamperchrome/blob/master/README.md\n\nTamper Chrome allows you to monitor requests sent by your browser and the responses. You can also modify requests as they go out, and to a limited extent modify the responses (headers, css, javascript or XMLHttpRequest responseText).\n\nSee what websites are sending in the background, modify submissions, switch out scripts, alter AJAX responses, Tamper Chrome puts the power of your browser back in your hands.\n\nTamper Chrome will prompt you to install its companion application when you first run it.\n\nIf you need help go to:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tamper-chrome-help"
