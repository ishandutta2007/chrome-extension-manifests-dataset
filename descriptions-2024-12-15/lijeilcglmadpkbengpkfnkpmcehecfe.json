It's misleading, right? No one likes the feeling of getting nickeled and dimed when they're trying to book lodging, especially when those extra fees can make a massive difference in the price per night of the stay. This extension fixes all of that and will hopefully protect you from being fooled into paying more per night of your Airbnb stay than you had originally planned. It will show you the all-in price per night of any Airbnb listing.\n\nAPPNC corrects prices in the following situations:\n\n1. basic listings\n2. on sale listings\n3. listings with a cancellation policy (hidden price details)\n4. plus listings\n5. handling of a more whitespace-heavy UI that seems to be the treatment side of an A/B test (before vs. after)\n\nNote: USD, EUR, and GBP are the only officially supported currencies at the moment. English, Spanish, and French are the only supported languages."
