All text in the screenshot can optionally be searched or pasted into your Amplenote notebook via built-in OCR.\n\n*Page excerpt*\nDrag to select quotes, phrases, or information you want to remember from any web page. A list of all quotations selected is captured by Amplecap for you to optionally edit before saving. The URL of the page and time of capture is automatically recorded to your note along with the list of citations.\n\n*Full page capture*\nCapture the entire scrollable contents of the current web page. We perform two passes of the page to ensure that dynamically loading content will be loaded & visible in your full page screenshot.\n\n*Quick Note*\nIf you want to capture a to-do item not necessarily related to the page you're browsing, and send it to your Amplenote to-do list without opening the app.\n\n*URL*\nCapture the URL of the current page -- usually in a to-do item for later follow up, or as part of a bullet list of bookmarks to assemble on a particular topic.\n\nAll of these types of content can be captured into the body of a note, a bullet item, or a to-do item. \n\nYou can also insert the captured content into a new note or existing note. New for this release, you can also capture your content to the copy buffer so you can paste it at a specific point in your note. \n\nThis release also introduces the ability to capture to Rich Footnotes, when you have \"Clipboard\" selected as the capture destination. This allows quickly snap screenshots or take excerpts, in a format that remembers the URL of the page and can easily be pasted into a research note or a to-do item."
