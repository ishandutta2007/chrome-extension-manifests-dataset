The site with the highest number of students is megasudy. However, this site offers double speed, but it does not tell you the length of the video that varies due to the double speed, so students have to use a calculator to calculate it themselves. To make it more convenient, I created a program that automatically shows the time when you go to the megasudy site. This makes it easier for students to write study plans."
