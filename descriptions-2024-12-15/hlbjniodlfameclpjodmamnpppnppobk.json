Out of this problem this plugin was born and after a few tests the first version is finally released.\n\nüëâüèª What can the plugin do?\n\nThe plugin extends your LinkedIn feed. From now on, you have additional entries available in the feed and each post in the options. These are assigned to each post, person or company and open after a click a new tab with the corresponding search.\n\n- View Latest Posts (for people and companies)\n- View Mentioned Posts (for people and companies)\n- View All Ads (for companies)\n- NEW: View all Followers (for people)\n\nThis Plugin requires a one time fee.
