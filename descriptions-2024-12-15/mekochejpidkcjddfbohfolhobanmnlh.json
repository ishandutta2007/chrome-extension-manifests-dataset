It is completely FREE to use! No additional charges or purchases necessary.\n\n➤ How does it work?\n\n• After installing the extension (or visiting or website below), create an Inform account- it takes just a few seconds!\n\n• Within the Inform web app, start writing your \"Rules\" or \"Templates\"\n\n\"Templates\" are custom-written responses to customer reviews that you would typically want to send. For example, you might want to write up a warm, positive Template for when a customer leaves you a 5-star rating!\n\n\"Rules\" are the actual conditions for which your Templates will trigger a response. All you need to do is identify the right conditions for a review and link it to which response template you want it to trigger. For example, you might want to establish a Rule for \"5 star\" reviews with an empty body and link it to that warm, positive Template!\n\n• Now, set it and forget it! The Inform web extension will remind you to check up on your Google Business' reviews once per week, and will generate responses to any new reviews within Google's reviews page directly. The extension will guide you through the process!\n\n\nFor more info, please see our website at https://inform-review.netlify.app."
