Does your hand get tired of scrolling past file diffs you don't care about? Have you ever deleted the file DOM elements using Dev Tools? Do you yearn for a better reviewing experience?\n\nPipe it Down helps solve this problem by providing a button to collapse files. The files you collapse are saved in local storage, so revisiting the pull request in the future will automatically collapse them for you. Collapsed files can be expanded again, if you change your mind.\n\nFeedback & contributions are welcome at https://github.com/thoughtbot/pipe-it-down."
