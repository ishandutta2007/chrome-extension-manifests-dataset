Please note that, only few tweaks are selected by default. Also, please keep in mind that, depending on your browser version and platform, this add-on might behave differently. There are few settings (related to timezone, geolocation and proxy) available in toolbar popup to adjust.\n\nCurrently there are 10 tweaks available for this add-on:\n1. Block most common ads.\n2. Block canvas fingerprint.\n3. Block font fingerprint.\n4. Block webgl fingerprint.\n5. Block audiocontext fingerprint.\n6. Block webrtc IP leakage.\n7. Change browser timezone.\n8. Change browser geolocation.\n9. Set custom socks5 proxy.\n10. Block most common trackers.\n\nNote 1: I have made this extension with Yubi's collaboration. This add-on is inspired by Speed Tweaks made by Yubi: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speed-tweaks/afebilemcaepdkmhmibgmnpfppnjimjf\n\nNote 2: to report bugs, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/privacy-tweaks.html)."
