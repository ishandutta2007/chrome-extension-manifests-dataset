You can use the Homestuck Commentary extension (https://homestuck.net/collection.html) to get the ultimate experience.\n\nTo see the in-browser commentary: just go to a supported URL like \"https://www.homestuck.com/problem-sleuth/10\" or \"https://www.homestuck.com/story/513\" and behold the commentary. Use the extension options in order to disable commentary display, if you just want the controls.\n\nKeyboard controls (arrow keys for changing pages, right ctrl key for opening/closing pesterlogs) work on every page of every adventure except Bard Quest."
