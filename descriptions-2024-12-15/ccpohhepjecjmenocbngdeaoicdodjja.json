With URL Tracker, this becomes a thing of the past. Simply save the URL to your local storage by hitting the 'Save Input' button, or copy and paste it into the extension. Assign a custom keyword like 'codeweb,' and your treasure trove is securely stored for future reference.\n\nBut URL Tracker offers more than just URL storage; it's about maximizing efficiency and productivity.

Once a URL has served its purpose, simply delete it from your storage with ease.
