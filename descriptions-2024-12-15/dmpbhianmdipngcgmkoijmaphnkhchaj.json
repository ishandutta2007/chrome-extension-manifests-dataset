The main advantage is that it promotes diversity of tests.\n\nAIFEX consists of two main elements:\n* A chrome plugin that listens to all interactions performed by testers, transmits them to the server, requests predictions for future interactions and visually highlights the expected interaction.\n*  A central server that stores all interactions performed by testers, integrates them into an AI and returns predictions calculated by the AI indicating future interactions that should be performed by testers."
