This is especially helpful for classic music listeners, when whole album needs to be played in whole, instead of random selection of tracks from your library or playlist.\n\nExtension is operated by clicking its icon, no menus or other buttons are present.\n\nSimply click the extension icon and YouTube Music library tab will open for you, in case it is not already present (non-existing YouTube Music library tab is signalised by black'n'white icon, color icon signalises, that proper tab is present in browser).\nThan it randomly picks album from your library and plays it. You need to keep the YouTube music library tab present in browser to play another random album or new tab will be opened again.\n\nAlso first play takes about 10s, until all your albums are loaded, as YouTube Music uses lazy loading of your library and extension needs to have list of all your albums. Any following random play is already instant."
