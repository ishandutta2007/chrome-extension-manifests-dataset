Screenful has you enter your story point estimates in the form of '(x) This is the card title' on each card so that it can import your data.  This Chrome extension will read those numbers and show you a total for the estimated points for each list in Trello so that you don't have to do the math!\n\nThere is also an option for showing/hiding these totals on each Trello board, for cases where cards have not been assigned story points, or if you wish to turn off the counts for other reasons."
