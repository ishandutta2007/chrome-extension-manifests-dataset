Locatio is a free browser extension that formats and visualises this data, displaying it as you browse property listings on Trade Me or Lodge.\n\n\nData is sourced from Statistics New Zealand\n2013 Census meshblock dataset\nAnalysis of public place assaults, sexual assaults, and robberies in 2015\nhttp://www.stats.govt.nz/"
