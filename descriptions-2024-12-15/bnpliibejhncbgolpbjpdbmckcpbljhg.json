I'm increasingly frustrated that Etherpad does not provide a spellcheck solution. Again and again I found myself going for Google Docs instead of Etherpad or at least typing in another program with better spellcheck support. Which totally goes against the collaborative aspect of Etherpad… This stops now! … at least for me. And maybe it is also useful for you :)\n\nThis plugin is still a work in progress, so if you find an Etherpad installation that does not function with this plugin, please reach out to me."
