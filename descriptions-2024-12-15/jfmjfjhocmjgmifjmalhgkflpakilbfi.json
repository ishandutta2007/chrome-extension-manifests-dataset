Switching and opening various tabs can become especially cumbersome when you're trying to browse through multiple titles on Netflix. Unfortunately, Netflix does not provide any movies ratings on the site.\n\n\"What's the Rating\" is an extension that hopes to make this process more efficient and intuitive. When you right click on Netflix movie title images, a context menu with a 'Get Ratings' icon will open up. Clicking on this icon will immediately fire an asynchronous browser notification with the appropriate ratings for that specific title. Alternatively, in popup-mode, you can effortlessly see the ratings for countless movies and TV shows by using the search bar.\n\nTo get started, users should navigate to the quick start page and generate a one-time API key from http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx. Once they enter their unique key, the extension will have the ability to dynamically pull movie information from the Open Movie Database. \n\nInstalling \"What's the Rating\" will make picking movies and TV shows much more convenient. Don't ever waste time picking the wrong one ever again!"
