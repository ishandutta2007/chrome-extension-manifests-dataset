Just like Stopbleed & Chromebleed, Heartbleed Search uses a web service developed by Filippo Valsorda and checks the URL of the page you have just loaded. This extension does not check the site from your location, but uses a service to check the domains on the search page.\n\nNo private information is being stored by the service doing the check, only the anonymous results.  \nYou can read about the service at https://filippo.io/Heartbleed/"
