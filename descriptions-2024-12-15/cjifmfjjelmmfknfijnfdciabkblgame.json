Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it isn't.\n\nAlso note: it doesn't make any difference for images that aren't resized by the browser, and there are even cases in which it doesn't seems to do anything for resized images either.\n\nMoreover, as the CSS property optimizes for contrast, there's a downside to it: depending on the image and its size, it will look \"serrated\", like it's lacking anti-aliasing.\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.1\nâ€¢ Initial version"
