If so, you're familiar with URL parameters. This extension messes with them.\n\nURL parameters fulfill a number of functions for web admins and advertisers, but some of the most common ones are used to track who you are, where you came from, and what you've been doing online before visiting. Sometimes these are long randomized strings for advertising algorithms to process, but certain types of parameters are embedded and tracked by and for real employees in marketing and surveillance to read and analyze.\n\nWhen you open the Deface Your Data Anti-Advertiser Tool, you will be prompted to enter a message to these data snoopers. Whenever you go to a new page, the extension will search for a number of popular parameters, and instantaneously replace their information with your message if it finds them. Not only does this protect you from one form of online tracking, but it also gives you a direct line of communication to the actual people behind the curtain of advertising. Use it wisely :)\n\n-------------\n\nThis a public resource and art project created by WTTDOTM.
