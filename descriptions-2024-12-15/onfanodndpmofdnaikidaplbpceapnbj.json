And it’s been brought to you by Frooition, an official eBay partner. \n\nTo use it, simply install the plugin and register at www.frooition.com/insights. Then, go to eBay and search as normal with whatever search term you want for the products you’d like to research. \n\nOnce the results page loads up, our tool will display a list of the fastest selling items on eBay for that specific search term, with all the sales information you need, such as average weekly sales and average prices, to make the decision if you should be selling the same or similar products.  \n\nIt will even show you the level of demand for each product and, if you want to, with one click you can then source a similar item from AliExpress or Alibaba, all from within the extension. \n\nWhen you find an item that you want to sell on eBay you can save it to your Favourites within your own dashboard at www.frooition.com/insights. That allows you to keep track of profitable items you've found. Not only that, but you can also then list them directly to eBay at the click of a button right from your dashboard, just adding your own images, price and description."
