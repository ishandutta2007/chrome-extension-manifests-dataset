Therefore, I created this extension that lets me easily pin lines I am interested in and find them later immediately using a simple shortcut. I even made them have notes and be persistent :).\nPersistent means that they stay on the page even if I exit chrome or shut down my computer until I remove them myself ensuring I never lose important information.\n\nSo being the awesome fellow I am, I am sharing it with everyone."
