It was created with the goal of simplifying the (stressful) registration process for Cal Poly students.\n\nFeatures:\n- Polyrating and number of evaluations appear next to the instructor's name (if they exist)\n- Background behind the instructor's name changes color corresponding to their rating\n- Click on any teacher's name to see their full Polyratings page (if it exists)\n- Search Polyratings for teachers and classes from the Chrome search bar (keyword is 'rating')\n- Options to gray out or hide classes that are closed, cancelled, conflict with your schedule, or have STAFF listed as the instructor\n- Checkbox at the top of each class list to select/unselect all classes at once\n- Click on any section header to toggle showing/hiding the course description\n- Errors list is now part of the sidebar instead of on top of the class listings\n\nFor those interested, source can be found here: https://github.com/timstoddard/PassThePlebs"
