This is where OIS can help you!\n\nThe ability to open Steam web pages pages in the Steam desktop client isn't as easy as it could be, so here's to an easier way. A simple button will appear on most Steam webpages which when clicked will reopen that exact page, just in the Steam desktop client.\n\nI'm just a guy who loves to write code. I'm only human, so there will likely be bugs somewhere. If you find any bugs, please report them to me (preferably on this project's Github issues page) with details of it and the page you were on at the time if relevant: https://github.com/PurplProto/OIS/issues"
