There is probably no other e-learning websites which has been translated into so many languages ​​and more are still actively beeing translated to.\n\nOut of this we create KA Polyglott, a unique tool for refugees to close their gaps in mathematics and at the same time learn the any other language. We develop an Webbrowser Extension for khanacademy.org where a foreign language speaker can simply see and watch the translation of texts and videos to his native language.\n\nThe current prototype is a technology demonstrator. And demonstrates the following functions on the following tutorial:\nhttps://de.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/addition-subtraction/basic_addition/v/basic-addition\n\n1. Title and descriptions of videos can be viewed with just a mouse click in various languages. Thanks to a text-to-speech engine, this can also be played audibly.\n\n2. Trough Flags, displayed at the right side, the learner which did not understand a video in German, can easily switch to the the video in his native language or any other language which he understands.\n\nNote: This is not an official Khan Academy application!"
