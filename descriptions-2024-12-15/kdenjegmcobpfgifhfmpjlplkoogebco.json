Every Crumb represents a query. QueryCrumbs compare the search results on the first page: If queries are similar, their Crumbs have the same color. If you hover over a Crumb, you see the corresponding query. Also, the hovered Crumb is compared to all others and the fill levels indicate the percentage of equal results. You can re-issue the query by clicking on the Crumb and delete it with a double-click.\n\n**NOTE**: This version is for evaluation purposes and therefore tracks any and every interaction with the aforementioned Crumbs anonymously"
