Trying to figure out how many marks you might need to get that coveted S grade?\nNow predict your class average and grades using crowdsourced data from other VIT students of your class.\n\nTo see your class averages simply open the marks page in VTOP and the class average for each component (DAs, CATs, etc.) will be displayed.\n\nPlease share this extension with your friends too so that your class average is predicted correctly. A greater percentage of the class using the extension implies a greater accuracy of average prediction. The number of students in your class using the extension is also displayed beside each mark component to give an idea about the accuracy of the predicted average.\n\nNote - By using this extension, you allow your anonymous marks to be saved for improving the accuracy of average prediction. We have made all-out efforts and taken a multi-layer approach to ensure all marks are anonymised and stored securely.\n\nPlease report any bugs/suggestions on the Chrome Web Store page."
