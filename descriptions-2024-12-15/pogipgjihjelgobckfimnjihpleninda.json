Indic Type solves this problem for you by enabling transliteration for your standard English keyboard. Now type in more languages without having to worry about learning to type on a non english keyboard\n\nIndic Type enables you to type in 30+ supported languages anywhere! You words get automatically replaced with the words from selected language. It's not simple translation. Instead, Indic Type does something referred to as transliteration which uses the phonetic sound of the word rather and changes the script in which it is written\n\nSupported languages:\nAmharic, Arabic, Bangla, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Persian, Portuguese (Brazil), Punjabi, Russian, Sanskrit, Serbian, Sinhala, Spanish, Tamil, Telugu, Tigrinya, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese\n\nThis extension is still in beta!
