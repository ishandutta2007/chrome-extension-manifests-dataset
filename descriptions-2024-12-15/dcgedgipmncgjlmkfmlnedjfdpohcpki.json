Only unfocused tabs will be discarded. Tabs which are pinned or are playing music will also not be discarded.\n\nWhen you focus/click on a tab, the tab's contents will immediately load up again.\n\nIf you hover over the toolbar icon, the tooltip will tell you how many tabs were discarded in the last pass. For example, it will show \"(4/9)\" to mean 4 tabs were recently discarded out of a total of 9 running tabs. Tabs previously discarded are not included in the total count.\n\nThis extension requires no special permissions to run, so use it in confidence.\n\nIf you enable the \"read browser history\" permission, you can enable a whitelist to choose which website domains should never be discarded."
