You can configure users to block in the settings. It is not very user friendly but it works. You'll have to list blocked users as follows:\n\nuser1,user2,user3 (comma separated, no spaces, case sensitive!).\nYou HAVE to refresh when you add or remove a user for it to take effect.\n\nAs of version 0.1.6 you can simply click the abo star(s) to the right of the username to block a user. It will open a new window with subscription information, which you can simply close.\n\nShout out to: Zosk, Tim, 4ebe, Dqod, Moeraskat <3\n\nThe plugin will remove said users' posts every second.\n\n-- WAHRHEIT"
