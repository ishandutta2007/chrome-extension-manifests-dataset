Original: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-content-security/ieelmcmcagommplceebfedjlakkhpden\nUse at your own risk. Disables the current page's Content Security Policy. Useful when testing what resources a new third-party tag includes onto the page.\n\nClick the extension icon to re-enable CSP headers. Click the extension icon again to disable CSP headers.\n\nUse this only as a last resort. Disabling CSP means disabling features designed to protect you from cross-site scripting. Prefer to use report-uri which instructs the browser to send CSP violations to a URI. That allows you keep CSP enabled in your browser but still know what got blocked. https://report-uri.com is a free tool that gives you a web interface to inspect CSP violations on your site."
