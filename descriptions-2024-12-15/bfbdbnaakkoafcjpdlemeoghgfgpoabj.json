Converse with it, but try to make sure that the context you want it to act on is CLEAR.\n\nGiven a query/request/command, you can perform 7 types of tasks with Jarvis :\n\n1) Reopen tabs given their specific context try to be as concise and accurate as possible. For e.g., \"Reopen entertainment\" , \" reopen funny videos \". This feature accesses the last tabs you visited under 6 hours of time and finds the most similar tabs to your query. ( Unfortunately, this command won't always work. I am a student developer and the free Hugging Face inference endpoints have very low rate limits. The OpenAI key is enough to empty my pockets :). )\n\n2) Close current tabs, e.g. \"Close this tab\", \"Shut this down please\" etc.\n\n3) Close multiple tabs when you name their websites, e.g. \" Close google and youtube \"\n\n4) Group tabs together by naming their websites \"club youtube tabs please\", \"put together LinkedIn and Udemy\", \"group google with medium \" etc.\n\n5) Navigate on your current tab, in both directions and if you want specify the number of times you want to go back too.\nE.g. - \"Can you go back twice\", \" Can you go forward 3 times?\"\n\n6) If Jarvis feels you are little sad and need cheering up, it will open random websites on its own.\n\n7) Open tabs given the website name ( Only use it when you want to open multiple types of websites, this is quite useless otherwise.)"
