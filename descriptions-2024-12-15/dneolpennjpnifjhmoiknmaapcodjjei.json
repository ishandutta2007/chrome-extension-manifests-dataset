Simply select the country of your choice and then select a desired channel from the right list. The radio will start to play automatically after loading is completed.\n\nNote 1: Some radio channels may not work properly. In case of any errors happening, please select a different channel and try again. You can pause the current radio or change the volume from the radio player in the UI. All changes are auto-saved to the memory in this add-on.\n\nNote 2: All the radio database is located locally on your machine. However, when you choose a station to play, the add-on fetches the audio data and image related to that station from the internet.\n\nIf you found a bug, or have a feature request in mind, please fill the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/radio-player.html)."
