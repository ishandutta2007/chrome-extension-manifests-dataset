Based on Product Hunt sentiment analysis. http://phben.ch\n\nPH Bench is using machine emotional intelligence to measure products reception at Product Hunt. A bunch of strongly worded comments can bring a mammoth product down. Powered by Product Hunt API, Google Cloud Natural Language API, somewhat tricky math, and common sense. PH Bench is free.\n\nIt ‘reads’ Product Hunt comments for us and, evaluating the rest of post info, gives a comprehensive 0-100 score.\n\nPH Bench detects scams, dark UX patterns and arrogant CEOs. A bunch of strongly worded comments can bring a mammoth product down.\n\nAt first, I had an issue with Product Hunt hype. I come here to find the best product for my needs. Tons of products get a really good reception at the start. Everybody is, like, 'well done!', 'Good stuff!' A very supportive and positive community indeed.\n\nHowever, sometimes later people who actually used the products come back and share some REAL LIFE experience with the product, which is not always that positive and super-exciting. These comments are golden! One nugget like that means more than a hundred of upvotes or ten exclamations to me.\n\nWhen choosing from the list of related products I don't always have time to read all comments and see if of the hunters have anything against using the product in question.\n\nThat's why Sliday.com team built http://phben.ch \n\nHype is easy to gain (buy in some cases), the launching comes naturally to many product owners. The real experience of the real customers is what matters the most.\n\nCompare products, share your findings. PH Bench finds coupons and discounts, detects scams, dark UX patterns and arrogant CEOs. A bunch of strongly worded comments can bring a mammoth product down."
