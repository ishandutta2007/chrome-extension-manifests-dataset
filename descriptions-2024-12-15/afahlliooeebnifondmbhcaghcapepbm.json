Most LinkedIn automation tools like linmailpro / meet alfred /  linked helper or even dux soup also provide such feature, but instead of filtering LinkedIn profiles in the search results every single day, you simply send them to your CRM page and work with the list daily. \n\nThis feature is designed to automate LinkedIn connections and let you enjoy working on this social media site. \n\n✔️ Mass Message \n\nThe feature is created to automate LinkedIn messages and give you a chance to mass message hundreds of 1st level connection in bulk making the social selling process super simple and fun. \n\n\n✔️ Profile Visitor\n\nThe feature opens the profiles of your target audience one by one, so they could see you’ve visited them, then visit you back and eventually engage with you. It's a true linked helper and social lead machine for your business. \n\n\n✔️ Auto Endorse \n\nEveryone wants to have 99+ endorsements of their skills, right? Launch Octopus to automatically endorse skills of your contacts and receive endorsements from them in return. \n\n\n✔️Create campaigns\n\nThere are no LinkedIn sales tools that allow to create multiple campaigns and keep multiple audiences separately. With Octopus CRM, you can do that! Due to this feature, sales prospecting becomes smart and result oriented. \n\n\n✔️ Build your own marketing funnel\nThis feature might be a pure gold and linked helper for you if you use it right. It transforms the tool into a real autopilot for LinkedIn allowing you to create a sequence of automated actions and get incredible results. \n\n- Listen to what our customers say -\n\n# This LinkedIn auto connect software is #1 for us. We’ve managed to grow our network from 0 to 1000 connections within a month and spent 10 minutes a day only. Fantastic autopilot for LinkedIn #\n\n# I remember using linkr, skrapp, meetalfred and saleslift, but did not manage to find them on chrome. Installed Octopus as an alternative and did not regret. Great LinkedIn lead generation software #\n\n# When I heard about the linkeddominator alternative (the tool I used before), I tried it out without the slightest hesitation and was pleasantly surprised. Even though, it does not work as a linkedin export tool, it combines features of elink pro, searchquant, linmailpro, meet alfred, prospectin and some buffer LinkedIn software... Very cool! #\n\nLinkedIn sales tools (not just a linkedin auto connect tools and profile skrapp) has significantly evolved and we truly hope you’ll be able to skyrocket your business using our linkedin lead generation tool. \n\nAnd do not forget to rate us if you love the software :)\n\n\nGet in touch\nWebsite: octopuscrm.io\nEmail:  support@octopuscrm.io"
