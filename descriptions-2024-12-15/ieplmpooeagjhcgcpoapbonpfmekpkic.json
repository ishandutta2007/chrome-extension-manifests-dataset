The CSS will persist across sessions and your preferences will be saved. \n\nThe best part of this extension is that it has minimal permissions, which reduces the risk of this being malware or being used in a trojan horse attack. Basically other extensions that need to inject javascript onto the page can also track your browsing history. This doesn't, because I only ask for permissions at runtime. This leads to a more secure experience if the only thing you want to do is inejct CSS. \n\nThe source code is at https://github.com/aadilmallick/css-injector\n\n**Current features**\n\n- Persistent injected custom CSS\n- Remove annoying toasts with an option in the options page\n- Unlimited storage\n- Code styling\n\n**Future features**\n\n- Add options for matches on URLs instead of just domain name"
