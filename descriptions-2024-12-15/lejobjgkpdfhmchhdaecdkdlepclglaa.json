DoTab uses Chrome Storage to sync your tasks across whatever chrome browsers you're logged into, that's handled by Google, and we can't see it.\n\n--\n\nA note from the creator of DoTab:\n\n\"I made DoTab because frankly, I suck at to-do lists. I've tried tons of different apps, notebooks, and planners and they all suffer from the same problem. They're out of reach, out of sight, out of mind. I wanted to make something that was helpful, pleasing to look at, and enjoyable to use. I hope you find it to be at least one of those things. ;)\"\n\n-Andy, creator of DoTab"
