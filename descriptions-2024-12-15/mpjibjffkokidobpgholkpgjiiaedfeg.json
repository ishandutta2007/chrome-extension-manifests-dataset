That's right - clickbait, even if you don't click it, is stealing mental resources that could be using elsewhere!\n\nClickbait Assassin attempts to address this dark pattern but removing the main offenders of clickbait from your browsing experience. Traditional advertising is not affected.\n\nThe plugin also allows you to add or modify the list of blacklisted domains, so you can customise your experience."
