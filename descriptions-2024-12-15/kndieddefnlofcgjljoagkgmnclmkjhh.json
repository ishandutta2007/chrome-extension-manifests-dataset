You then had to create a bookmark for each and every one of the tabs in the group. And it probably annoyed you :)\n\nYou might know that by right-clicking on a bookmarks folder, you can open all its tabs in a group, which even gets the name of the folder.\n\nThis extension allows you to do the opposite : by clicking on the extension's icon (top right corner of your screen), a folder containing the group's tabs is automatically created in your bookmarks bar, with the title of the group as title. To do so, the currently open tab simply needs to be in the desired group when you click on the extension's icon.\n\nYou can then quickly move this new folder to the folder or location that suits you!"
