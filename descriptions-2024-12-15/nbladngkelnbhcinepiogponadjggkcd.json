Protect yourself from online threats with real-time alerts, all while maintaining your browser’s performance. Whether you’re a casual internet user or a security-conscious professional, PhishGuard ensures safe browsing without slowing you down. Install now for complete phishing protection!\n\nWHY PHISHGUARD?\n\nPeople are the highest-risk targets in the cybersecurity of the internet. Hackers target them via phishing e-mails and try to obtain login credentials, activate ransomware or spread malware.\n\nAt Blue Arca, we have developed innovative anti-phishing software to mitigate this risk. It acts as a personal automated security advisor that triggers vigilance at the moment it matters. Now, this anti-phishing software functionality is available to everyone as PhishGuard. Because everyone is at risk of a phishing attack and no amount of security awareness training, banking or government campaign will keep people alert to phishing attacks throughout a busy day.\n\nPhishGuard acts as a safety barrier by alerting you to potential threats as they come in. It continuously checks all incoming email against a personal user profile. Any unknown sender or link will trigger a notification for the user to check the potential security risk. When you mark it as a potential threat or as safe the extension learns from it and you automatically report it to our intelligence team for further investigation. Completely private. The anti-phishing extension works with Gmail, Outlook.com and Live.com."
