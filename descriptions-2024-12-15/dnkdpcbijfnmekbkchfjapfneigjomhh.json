Clicking multiple times changes the highlighting coverage. As the page receives more highlighting from clicking the icon, the icon will show less available ink in the highlighter.\n\nPlease let me know if you find particular pages where the extension does not work well. *Auto Highlight* currently uses an algorithm for picking important sentences based on term frequencies in the entire article. With examples of problematic pages, I can possibly improve the technology. I would also like to incorporate more advanced techniques from extraction-based article summarization research.\n\nThe source code is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/dstein64/highlight\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nThis extension does not collect user data nor transmit user data remotely. Options for the extension are saved locally."
