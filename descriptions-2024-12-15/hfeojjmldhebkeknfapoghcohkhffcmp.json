Users can create and save prompt templates for use by the extension with any OpenAI-compatible API.\n\nTemplates can use data from ones active browser window (e.g., selected text or the whole text of a webpage) as well as text input provided by the user. They can also feed into each other, allowing one to create complex interactions. For example: (1) summarize and ask questions of a webpage (e.g., What are the main conclusions of this article? What did so and so say about this or that?); or (2) translate selected text from one language into another. Then draft a reply in the original language."
