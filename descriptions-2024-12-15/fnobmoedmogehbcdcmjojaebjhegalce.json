In order to you know the most important, relevant and interesting ones for you as a user who accepts them or plans to accept them. \n\nWhy install it?.\nHave you ever clicked accept the privacy policies and/or terms of use without reading what you are accepting? Because they are too long and in most cases difficult to understand. Well, Simpliterms summarizes them in short key points so that you know what is most important and therefore know that you are accepting and do not end up in problems later for accepting things that you should not have accepted.  \n\nHow it works?.\n1. Download the extension.\n2. Log in or create free an account at: simpliterms.com \n3. Subscribe to a plan (free, basic, pro).\n4. Click on the extension icon at the time you want it to make a summary. When you click it, it will search for the policies of the page you were on at the time you clicked and it will begin to summarize the policies.\n\nVersion: 1.1.0\n\n1) Summaries in multiple languages: \nNow you can change the language of summaries on the /account page of SimpliTerms. You have the option to switch between Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese.\n\n2) Improved efficiency in obtaining summaries.\n\n3) We have updated the existing model; now, all paying users can generate real-time summaries whenever they desire. Free plan users, however, are limited to a maximum of three summaries per day, which are statics summaries."
