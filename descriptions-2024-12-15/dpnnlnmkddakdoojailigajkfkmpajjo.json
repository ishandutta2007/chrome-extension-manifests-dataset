Visit the extension store, search for QuickSave, and click 'Install' or 'Add to Browser'.\n\nDownloading photos and videos:\nWhen you're on an Instagram page, you'll notice two new buttons under each post: 'Download' and 'Repost'. Simply click 'Download' under a photo or video to save it.\n\nSaving Instagram Stories:\nTo save an Instagram Story, click on it. You'll find a 'Download' button at the top right corner of the story. Click this to save the story.\n\nSharing Instagram content:\nTo repost a photo, video, or story, click 'Repost'. Keep in mind that reposting someone else's Instagram story adds it to your own, and a post goes onto your feed. Always respect copyright and seek permission when sharing content on Instagram.\n\nLimits on content sharing:\nWhen sharing Instagram videos and photos, remember:\n\n- Videos should not exceed 60 seconds in duration.\n- File size must be under 4GB.\n- Content must adhere to specific dimensions: 16:9 for widescreen, 1:1 for square, and 4:5 for vertical.\n- Images must meet minimum resolutions: 600x315 for widescreen, 600x600 for square, and 600x750 for vertical on Instagram.\n\nFollowing these steps will ensure you use QuickSave effectively. Always respect the creators' rights when downloading and sharing content.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nInstagram™ is a trademark of Instagram Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.
