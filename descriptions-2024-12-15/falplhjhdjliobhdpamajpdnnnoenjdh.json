This extension allows for exactly that by adding a download button next to the 'play' and 'skip' buttons.\nEnjoy! ðŸ˜Š\n\n* Due to limitations arising from security, I can't rename the filename to the name of the song, so you have to name it appropriately yourself once it's downloaded.\n\nAcknowledgments:\n- Thank you to you Luna, who showed me this wonderful website during a flat party in 2022\n- Thank you to Radiooooo for hosting the website and allowing people to enjoy all of the music"
