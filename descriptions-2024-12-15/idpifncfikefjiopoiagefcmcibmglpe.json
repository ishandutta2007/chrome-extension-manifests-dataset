Iago automatically keeps track of the words / grammar you’ve seen and has built custom spaced-repetition quizzes for you to recall the content you’ve seen so far.\n\n➤  The only platform that tracks grammar\nWe believe grammar is just as important as vocabulary — especially how easy it is to forget part of the structure. Iago tracks and will display grammar on the content you’re watching. \n\n➤  Keep track of your progress globally\nProgress isn’t bound to a list or deck anymore, Iago keeps track of your progress per word / grammar. \n\n⏎ Give Us Feedback\nWe’re continuously building so we’d love to hear from you live on what features you all want next! \n\nJoin our Discord: https://discord.gg/cXvth3zCrn\nEmail Us: hello@getiago.com\n\n⚠ Your Privacy\nIago will only append subtitles and quizzes on top of your existing content. \nFor more information, please check our Privacy Policy https://coda.io/@iago/iago-help-center/privacy-policy-7"
