No training is required - the decision makers just click on the extension icon while displaying the SAP Enable Now simulation or course and submit their decisions - with or without additional comments. \n\nAlso, reviewers and content developers can leave their feedback on the content elements: bubbles, and screens when watching the recording. The feedback indicators next to the elements will let involved parties know about the approval status of the element.\n\nTo allow the extension to work with your SAP Enable Now Cloud system, please add the parameter DISABLE-CSRF-PROTECTION to the Supported Features field, which you can find in the Administration > Server Settings of your SAP Enable Now Manager. This is required to allow the extension to send data to the SAP Enable Now Manager on your behalf.\n\nThe extension currently supports SAP Enable Now Cloud systems only (that is, where the domain name ends with *.enable-now.cloud.sap)\n\nThe SEN Content Review Wizard is not a part of the official SAP Enable Now product."
