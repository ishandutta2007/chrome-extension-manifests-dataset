Youtube Tabs is purely a UI modification, meaning it can only organize the subscriptions it sees. Unless this changes, Youtube tabs may soon have to be sunsetted.\n\nSay no more to enormous and cumbersome lists of subscriptions. Group your subscriptions just how you want them quickly and easily directly from the sidebar!\n\nThe Youtube Tabs extension builds functionality into the Youtube UI, allowing you to easily sort your subscriptions into different tabs within the side-menu of Youtube itself.\n\n• Create tabs within the subscription panel\n• Select and organize your subscriptions directly from the side-panel\n• Customize names and colors\n• Favorite subscriptions\n• Show/Hide tabs\n• Move tabs around to have your favorite subscriptions right where you want them\n• Quickly organize new subscriptions\n\nSimply install, activate, and navigate to Youtube. A help/info menu will open showing you all the functions of the extension as well as the newest updates.\n\nWARNING: This extension saves data locally and can be lost if you reset your browsing data. You can backup your tab data via the import/export buttons in the help menu (Accessible via the \"?\" button in the Subscriptions header). If you clear your browser's local data (or reset/uninstall your browser) without a backup copy, your tab data will be lost.\n\nNote: The functionality for this extension removes the ability to drag the scroll bar in the subscriptions panel. This is a minor inconvenience that unfortunately could not be avoided, although this may change in a future update.\n\nCurrently tested on Chromium and Firefox browsers."
