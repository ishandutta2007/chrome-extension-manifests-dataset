Also includes a convenient Finals Calculator.\n\nSchool Loop HoraceScope (excuse the pun) is a convenient way to answer all these questions. Instead of adding up all your points by hand, HoraceScope takes care of all the tedious details for you, and lets you easily see your potential new grade.\n\nFeatures:\n- An edit mode that allows you add, edit, and delete assignments.\n- Works with categories and point based grading.\n- Easy Method of detecting finals\n\nInstructions:\n\nEditing past grades:\nSimply click on one of your past grades and change it, either through the keyboard or the arrow keys.\n\nAdding new grades:\nClick on the New Assignment button, click the dropdown menu to change any categories, and then change grades freely.\n\nAdding a finals category:\n\nNote: Some classes may not have a final category. If your grade is unweighted or if the finals goes in one of the available categories (like tests), no checkbox will appear allowing you to add a finals category.\n\n1. Check the Add Final Categories check mark. Your grade may drop immediately, but don't panic. The program just assumes you currently have a 0 in a finals category (sure to lower anybody's grade). \n2. Now click on the New Assignment button and select the finals category.\n3. Now you can change your finals grades around!\n\n\nNote: Any changes made are purely hypothetical, and will not change your actual grade.\n\nSend any concerns, bug reports, or questions to horacehe2007@yahoo.com.
