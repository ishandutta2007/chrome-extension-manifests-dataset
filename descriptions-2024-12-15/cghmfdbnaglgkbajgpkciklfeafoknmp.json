Use Sticky Notifications (Notification are visible until closed/read)\n2. Use Default behavior (Notifications are automatically dismissed)\n\nAfter installing the extension the 1st option will activate automatically, which will overwrite the default behavior.\n\nThis can be configured by going to Preferences, see screenshots (click on User -> Preferences -> Notifications -> Visibility options).\n\n\n***\nUpdate:\n\nSlack released a Windows app making this extension almost obsolete. \n\nHowever, for some reason, the Windows app Notifications don't work properly MOST of the times so I still HAVE TO use this extension instead the official Windows app (Notifications simply do not get triggered and I keep missing important messages ALL THE TIME).\n\nAlso, official Windows app doesn't have \"sticky\" Notifications.\n***"
