You can view the patient’s chart in the EHR while messaging or building payment plans and taking payments—all in one window. \n\nCollectly customers who use Athenahealth or eClinicalWorks can also use the extension to quickly find and pull up the corresponding patient’s information in Collectly. They can also add any patients from the EHR into Collectly with the click of the button.\n\nMore about Collectly: Collectly is a tech-enabled patient A/R service that works as an add-on for your EHR/PM and takes over your patient A/R within 0-90 days to accelerate patient cash flow, eliminate calls, and prevent patients from getting to be turned over to collections. \nCollectly supports all major billing practices - from storing a card on file with AutoPay and payment plans to traditional billing with paper and digital statements and an automated A/R follow-up with emails, texts, calls, direct mail, live-chat, and even push notifications."
