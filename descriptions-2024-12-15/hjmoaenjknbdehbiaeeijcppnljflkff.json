You can also email support@hushbookmarks.com for support, or go to the About page of the Hush app.\n\n1.2.0\n+ Bookmarks importing now fixed!\n+ Hush Pro members (thanks <3) can now share bookmarks as links that automatically expire after a set time – confidently prevent would-be snoopers of your chat history from seeing what's been shared. On expiry, all link data is deleted and purged from our server – just like that, they're gone!\n\nHush Pro is here!\n+ Many UI improvements\n+ Access your Hush bookmarks from any device at hushbookmarks.com\n+ Create custom folders for your bookmarks under a single password\n+ Automated, encrypted backups so you never have to fear losing your links, even when you reinstall Chrome\n\n--\n\nWe've added a new \"bookmarks\" permission and so you may be asked to re-approve on Chrome. We never track, share, or store any of your data except the bookmarks you explicitly create, and your bookmarks are always stored encrypted. See https://hushbookmarks.com/privacy for our privacy policy, or email us at support@hushbookmarks.com if you have any questions or concerns.\n\n--\n\nWe've always wanted to be able to save webpages while browsing in incognito mode - but bookmarking would defeat its purpose, and emailing links to ourselves just doesn't cut it.\n\nHush is an extension we've created to solve this problem. It runs only in incognito mode and so doesn't disrupt everyday browsing, but when you really need to bookmark your surprise party plans, et cetera, you can do so easily from the address bar. The next time you're in incognito mode, it's then really easy to bring up pages you've bookmarked in the past. You can also easily make multiple sets of bookmarks by choosing a different password for each set.\n\nWe've placed a heavy emphasis on security. Your bookmarks are encrypted using the highest standards before they're stored, so any would-be snoopers will never be able to see what you're actually planning.\n\n--\n\nThanks for checking us out! If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, email us at support@hushbookmarks.com!"
