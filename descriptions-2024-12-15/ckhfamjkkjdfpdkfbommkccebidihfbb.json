The size of the PNG is 999px x 999px and uses the largest error correction. \n\nIt was created for a warehouse stock system that uses a URL in the form of a QR code to pick and ID stock items. The tool being used was slow and unreliable, using this is faster without clicking options every time a QR code is needed or waiting for an ad pop up times out.\n\nThis extension is useful for quick QR codes to use on posters and for promotional media that points to a URL."
