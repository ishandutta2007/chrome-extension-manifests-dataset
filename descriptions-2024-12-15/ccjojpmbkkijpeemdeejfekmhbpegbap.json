I wanted a Chrome extension that would block non-productive websites for me.\n\nSimilar extensions already exist, where you can blacklist URLS (eg Reddit, or YouTube), but I wanted something a bit more sophisticated. I wanted something that could tell the difference between a productive YouTube video/Reddit post (eg a YouTube video for a programming tutorial) vs a non-productive one (eg most YouTube videos - I tend to go down a rabbit hole of watching a whole bunch of cooking videos).\n\nThis extension works by having you mark non-productive/productive websites as you browse. Over time, the algorithm learns to classify certain websites as productive, or non-productive.\n\nIt's a really fun project. The algorithm isn't particularly sophisticated, but it is lightweight, and it's just a fun experience to work with a model as you see it grow with the data you feed it."
