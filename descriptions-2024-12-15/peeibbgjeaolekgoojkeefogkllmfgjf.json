Chrome preserves only the last 90 days of browsing history locally, and the extension overcomes that limit by persisting the data in Google Cloud Platform. As a bonus, it becomes possible to aggregate history from browser instances installed on distinct machines.\n\n\"Log Web History to Firebase\" submits details about each visited URL to your own Cloud Firestore, completely private and transparent. You need to setup a personal Firebase project with generous free tier that should be enough during several years. You can further study the records in \"Cloud Firestore\" at console.firebase.google.com, export them to BigQuery for analysis, download JSON, etc. Once you outgrow the free tier, you can either move the old data out from the DB, or purchase the pay-as-you-go Firebase plan from Google with estimated charges of less than 20 cents per month.\n\nTo start using the extension, you need to set two parameters: apiKey and projectId. Follow the Getting Started with Firebase guide to obtain them: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup\nRefer to the README for more details: https://github.com/vmarkovtsev/web-history-extension/blob/master/README.md\nThe users of Kiwi Browser on Android should disable QUIC in kiwi://flags\n\nNote that the extension collects neither any tokens nor personal information. The only thing it does with your data is sending your browsing history to your Firebase over HTTPS."
