You just install it and it should work. \n\nOnce you install it, you should simply not see any sponsored posts anymore. It will never remove a post that isn't sponsored.\n\nTo see how many ads have been blocked, click on the icon's extension.\n\nAll languages are supported!\nIf you have any problems, please contact me on my email.\n\nThis extension has nothing to do with the Facebook company.\n\nI put a lot of time and effort making this free extension. If you enjoy it and you wish to support me, you can donate via this link:\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=BTK97P92ZF29U"
