Choose a number of mines and click the \"Play\" button to start a new game and the contributions grid will become a minesweeper board.\n\nRules of the game are the classic ones: each cell could have a mine or not, if you click a cell that contains a mine, the game is over, otherwise, the cell will reveal how many adjacent cells contain mines. Using these clues, the goal is to reveal all non-mined cells.\n\nOf course, you can hide the game board anytime to be able to keep using GitHub profile pages as usual by clicking the \"eye\" button.\n\nLeft mouse click to reveal a cell content and right mouse click to mark a cell as mined.\n\nMinesweeper board will always be a 53x7 cells grid as GitHub contributions original panel.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels with different numbers of mines: 30 (easy), 50 (medium), and 80 (hard).\n\nEnjoy the game!"
