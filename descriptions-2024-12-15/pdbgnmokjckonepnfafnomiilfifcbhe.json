Each platform has an off / off Switch so you can independently control which interface upgrades you want.\n\nYouTube: Comments are reformatted into a more compact, 2-column arrangement, and the video will move to the right and scroll with your screen as you read the comments.  You can browse comments while the video plays.\n\nTwitter:  A search button is added to the header of user tweets.  You can quickly search twitter profiles to learn what they think about a topic and whether you want to follow them.\n\nTwitch: Comments are reformatted for a faster reading experience, especially useful on large channels where the scroll is so fast you can't read the names.\n\nReddit: Directs to an alternative Reddit experience with column style format."
