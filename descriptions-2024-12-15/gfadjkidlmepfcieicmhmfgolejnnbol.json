The usual problem with these \"detail pages\" is that they contain a lot of other elements and noise like adverts, other thumbnails, unrelated content and image is often shrinked and cropped so you don't see the original right away.\n\nThis extension solves that by providing you with a simple keyboard shortcut CTRL+Q (Windows) or Cmd+Q (MacOS) that finds the largest image in the current page (eventually searches for a link leading to even larger original image) and displays it without any disturbing elements. Pressing the shortcut again will take you back.\n\nIf this gets somewhat popular, I may add configurable shortcut and more - leave your ideas. Enjoy."
