Comes with documentation on all the shortcuts, just click the extension icon in the menu bar to view.\n\nThis has vastly sped up my sample selection process on Splice, I hope it can you out too.\n\nNote: This is an unofficial third party extension created by me. It is completely free and doesn't not make money via ads or any other means. Enjoy!\n\nP.S. Thanks to Bj√∂rn-Eric Abrahamsson for helping me keep this extension up to date"
