Well, I have, so I wrote an extension to do something about it as everything else I tried didn't quite cover it for me.  If you're in a similar boat, this might help!\n\nThe quick version: click the icon, go through the list of your extensions that pops up and check Y for those you want it to force to be enabled, N on those you want to force to be disabled, and leave the rest alone.  Click Save, click Execute, and off you go!  These rules are saved locally and never synced, since that would defeat the purpose.\n\nThere's also an option on the extension's very short options page as to whether you want it to automatically execute the rules when the browser starts.  And finally, you can right-click the pretty butterfly icon and there's a menu item for executing the rules.  Do it however works for you!\n\nRelease History:\n0.0.3 (2017-07-06) -- added import and export\n0.0.2 (2017-07-03) -- initial store release"
