Visit your (or anyone else's) Faves page (whether \"Featured\" or \"All\" view) or Collection, and click the heart in the address bar. Deviant Love will scan the page/collection and list the artists who have art there, in \"most faved deviations\" order. Choose an artist for a listing of faved/collected deviations!\n\nYou can also, from the Faves page or Collection, right-click an artist's name and click \"List faved art from <deviant>\" to go directly to the list of deviations for that artist.\n\nArtists that you're watching for new deviations will be marked. If an artist that should be marked is not, you know what to do~\n\nDeviant Love provides a find bar to let you search for both artists and deviations on the page you scanned.\n\nPossible uses for this extension include:\n- Browse the list of deviations from your favorite artist\n- Pick someone from the list and leave a nice comment to brighten up their day\n- Be pleasantly surprised that someone created several deviations that you faved at different times without realizing they're from the same person\n- Find more artists to add to your watch list\n- Quickly find an artist or deviation by name\n\nImportant links such as the link to the source code repo are at the Deviant Love deviation page. News and a place to leave visual suggestions are at the DeviantLoveSoftware group. Feedback of all flavors are welcome!"
