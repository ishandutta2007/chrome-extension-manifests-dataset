We take the approach of \"the quantity makes the poison\". Getting entertained on Social Media isn't inherently bad. Too much of it is.\n\nDespiral interrupts your habit of endless scrolling and puts your focus back on what really matters to you. If that is creating art, playing video games or studying.\n\nYou gain full control over how long you want to scroll and how long you want to be productive."
