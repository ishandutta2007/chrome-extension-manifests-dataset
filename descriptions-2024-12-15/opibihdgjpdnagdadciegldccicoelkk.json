Besides, we always forget to disable the Item Help and then when we click to process something, we realize the mistake (I know you do that too ).\n\n\n\nWe feel you and we created a very nice tool to help you out with that  task: Steltix JDE Reveal !\n\n\n\nItâ€™s an add-on to Google Chrome that can be installed from the Chrome Store or directly from Steltix Website. With a click away, you can get all form IDs such as: fields, grid columns, menu buttons and row exists"
