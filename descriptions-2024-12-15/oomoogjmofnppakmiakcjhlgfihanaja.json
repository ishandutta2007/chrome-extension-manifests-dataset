Then, wait for the app to load completely. Once the addon is ready, please enter a desired text prompt in English (at the top) and then press the - Start - button. Depending on your machine, it takes up to a few minutes for the AI engine to generate the audio track (at the bottom section).\n\nPlease note that this is still a work in progress and might not be able to generate valid music for all text prompts. Moreover, during the music generation process, you might see some lags or freezes in your browser. So please be patient until the AI engine completes the job. This addon uses a machine-learning library for the web called Transformers.js (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/). It also uses a text-to-music library called MusicGen (https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-small).\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/text-to-music.html)."
