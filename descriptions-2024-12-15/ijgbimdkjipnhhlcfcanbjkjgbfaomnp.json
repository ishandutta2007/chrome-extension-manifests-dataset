Its super simple, but you'd \nbetter know where your web accessible paths are.\n\n### Installation\n\nFirstly, create a world writable directory on your webserver \n(ie: chmod 777 it). Create subfolders below this if you want to \nenable saving into a few different groups.\n\nYou will need to save a copy of, and configure, the \nSave-to-Website.php file to somewhere world readable on your \nwebserver. In the php file you'll find 3 variables which need to be\nconfigured:\n\n    // the full URL to the storage folder.\n    $externalURL = \"http://yoursite.com/path/to/images\";\n\n    // the relative path to storage folder compared to the php file\n    $internalPath = \"\"; \n\n    // set a password here and then configure this in the extension\n    $password = \"\"; \n    \nYou can either grab the files from here on github, or use this link\nand install it from [the Chrome Store](http://bit.ly/18MejN5). Using\nthe Chrome Store is recommended as the extension will then be auto\nupdated if/when I make changes.\n\n### Credits and Props\n\nThis extension is a stripped down hack of antimatter15's \ncloudsave: https://github.com/antimatter15/cloudsave\n\nProps to the crazy88 for putting up with my testing.\n\nThanks to lexpex for pointing out that this old extension wasn't \nworking any more.\n\n### Version Info\n\n#### v 0.4.3 (7th Nov 2013)\n\n* edited to fix uploading to subdirectories (Chrome changed the \nway it handles localStorage.setItem of objects, I'm now using \nJSON.stringify and JSON.parse when setting and getting.)\n\n- - - - \n#### v 0.4.1 (16th May 2013)\n\n* URL now checked when updated in options, alerts if unreachable\n\n- - - - \n#### v 0.4.0 (16th May 2013)\n\n* Fixed issue with WebKitBlobBuilder which was corrupting uploads\n* Menu rebuild logic no longer done in options.js\n* Settings saved via options.js and menus rebuilt in background.js\n* Added button on options page to allow user to save and close\n* Added check in php to catch if subdir is undefined\n\n- - - - \n#### v 0.3.0 (16th May 2013)\n\n* php file can now be located in same directory as image storage\n* Fixed another menu creation issue\n* Fixed duplicate menus being made if options were resaved\n* Fixed issue when no sub-directories were set \n\n- - - - \n#### v 0.2.0 (15th May 2013) \n\n* Updated to manifest version 2 \n* Fixed WebKitBlob changes \n* Reworked options saving / loading \n* Reworked sudbir menu system \n* Reworked password system (I don't see how it was ever working) \n* Generally took this a bit more seriously because someone else is \nactually trying to use it!\n\n- - - - \n#### v 0.1.0 (18th Mar 2011) \n\n* Extension working in basic form"
