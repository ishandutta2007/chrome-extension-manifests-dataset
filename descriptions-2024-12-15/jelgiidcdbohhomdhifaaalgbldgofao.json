This allows users to quickly and easily switch between contexts as well as share these contexts to be shared with other ContextSwitch users. Once a context is saved the user will be able to be open it from the extension popup, from the right-click context menus, or from the address bar using the keyword !ctx followed by the name of your context.\n\nCreating a new context saves all tabs not already in a tab group.\n\nAll contexts and their respective urls are saved locally in chrome storage ONLY.  Contexts are only shared when exported. When exporting a context it is sent to our servers to generate the 5 Minute Share Code where it is cached for 5 minutes or until it is imported by another user. Share codes can only be used once. If ContextSwitch is unable to obtain a 5 minute share code the context will be saved to your clipboard in it's entirety and can still be shared offline.\n\nWe do not make any attempt to keep, sell, or otherwise intrude on your data. Context's that are exported are cached temporarily using a unique one-time key until viewed by another user, or the timeout is reached then are promptly deleted."
