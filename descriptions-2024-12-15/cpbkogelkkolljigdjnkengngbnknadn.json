However, there is no way to monitor your progress in a course other than \"eye icons\" for videos watched in the sidebar. The total duration time of a course is 2 clicks away and it does not show your remaining time.\n\nThis extension reads the sidebar to calculate total time and remaining time and adds two widgets above the sidebar that shows your remaining time and the total time of the course.\n\nIt is Open Source, you can checkout the repository from https://github.com/eralpsahin/lynda-remaining-time"
