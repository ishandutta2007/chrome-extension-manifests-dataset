When you visit a web site, it will be checked in realtime against our extensive databases of malicious web sites. Our cybersecurity databases contain over 15 million threats with 14 years of historic data and thousands of new threats added daily. Our security databases are trusted by the world's leading antivirus and security providers, governmental institutions as well as by Google via its VirusTotal service.\n\nOf course, you already have antivirus protection on your PC, laptop or server that gives you some level of protection. However, we specialize in detecting and blocking the most recent and fast-moving threats that criminals put on the Internet in ways that often avoid detection by typical antivirus products. Our Extension is a necessary compliment to your existing cybersecurity protection measures.\n\nOur Safe Browsing Extension is completely transparent and requires no user configuration or interaction. You simply install it in the normal way and you will be protected. In the event that you visit a malicious web site or IP address using your Google Chrome browser, our Extension will prevent the malicious web page from loading and you will receive a red MalwareURL warning page. You can also use this warning page to visit our web site and look up the URL to better understand why it has been blocked.\n\nOur protection is primarily designed for business and organizational usage and we provide detailed documentation about how to deploy it automatically using software distribution tools such as Windows Active Directory. That said, it is also an excellent option to improve browsing safety for home and small business users."
