Through your browser, phone numbers are enabled as clickable links that auto generate phone calls to your deskphone or WebPhone. Your phone will start ringing once the number is clicked on your screen, and upon answering the call it will begin to call the number you originally clicked. ClickToCall works great with most CRM and ticketing systems such as Salesforce, SugarCRM, QuickBase, Zendesk and ZoHo.  For advanced users, some CRM and ticketing systems can also work with ClickToCall to enable incoming call screen-pops, matching the incoming phone number with records in the CRM or ticketing system.   \n\nIf you are a current user of Zendesk, ClickToCall responds to incoming callers through your Zendesk account. When clicking on the incoming call, it will automatically direct you to the existing profile or direct you to a new client page. Once the call is finished, a popup will appear to either create a new ticket or add to an existing ticket. This will enhance the caller experience and maximize productivity for your employees. \n  \nIn the Dial Number box, phone numbers can be manually dialed, or dialed by simply copying and pasting the number into ClickToCall.  An internal list of extensions is also available - simply start typing the extension number or employee’s name and ClickToCall will dynamically list the internal extensions.  \n\n\nFree for all customers using FluentCloud's award winning cloud telecommunications platform."
