For that, ImmobilienScout24 is usually an option. However, the searching page does not provide complete information based on the user's preference, such as availability date, pets, parking lots, etc. \n\nThat forces YOU to enter every flat page to discover detailed descriptions, opening subpages again and again. \n\nWhy should we lose time? This extension parses all flat-card subpages automatically and presents the data in a handy way. You can disable and enable information you need to in settings, namely availability date, pets, parking lots, or floor. \n\nEnjoy the saved time while searching for an apartment :) \nP.S. If this extension saved your time and eased the search, you can support me with a donation."
