Butter allows you to clean up those hideous UTM tokens and generate a prettier URL with the word \"butts\" at the end.\n\nButter lights up when it detects a page with a UTM code on it. Click on the Butter icon and it will copy an updated version of that URL to your clipboard. The first time you use it, it will ask for permission to \"See text and images copied to the clipboard\" Be sure to click \"allow\". You won't have to do this again. URLs can be tricky, so if a link is important to you, be sure to check it before you share it with your friends. \n\n\"What if I like UTMs?\"\nHey, that's cool. This tool is optional. The goal is to give consumers more control of the links they share. \n\n\"This tool is cool, but could I use another word instead?\"\nNo, butts is the only word that will work. Next question.\n\n\"Why butts?\"\nImagine a dark smokey room filled with marketers. They've been up for days working on their latest campaign and are finally seeing the results in real time. One of them points at the screen and another nods positively before taking a long drag off their cigarette before rolling their chair closer to a nearby printer that is constantly printing. The marketer does a double take, then drops their cigarette to the floor. They rip a sheet from the printer and bring it closer to their sweaty face. \"You guys\" they say, \"why does this UTM code say 'butts'?\" Doesn't that sound fun? I thought so. \n\n\"What was the inspiration for Butter?\"\nRemember when stores started pushing users to sign up for membership cards? The cards were the only way to get special deals at stores like Safeway and Walgreens, but they were also used to track consumers. So friends of mine would occasionally swap cards with each other just to confuse the marketers. Butter is a throwback to those days of swapping membership cards and giving power back to consumers."
