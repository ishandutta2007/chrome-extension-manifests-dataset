This data can include information about authors or dates that the version was created and published. \n\nBut for our clients' reports, we provide version summaries which include this data and therefore decided to automate this process and share the tool with the GTM/GA community. We are planning to add more features so any feedback and suggestions are welcomed.\n \nThe extension adds two buttons to the GTM versions page. \nExport to csv - exported all versions to .tsv file. We use tab separated format as Status or Name column can contain commas. \nExport to Google Sheets - create new Spreadsheet and copy all versions to this file. Before exporting you should grant permission to access Google Sheets. But the extension will have access only to create new spreadsheets and will have access to already existing documents and tables.\n\nExport logic: before exporting extension select to show all versions and if GTM container has deleted versions the tool checks select deleted versions, so result contains information about deleted versions too."
