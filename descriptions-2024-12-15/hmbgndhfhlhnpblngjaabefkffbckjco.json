Simply open the Robinhood stock page you wish to set an alert on and open the extension. The extension will prompt you for a threshold price and then save it. Leave the tab open and continue on with your day. If at any point the tab indicates the price has crossed your given threshold, you will get a notification. No longer worry about multitasking and give your complete focus on the task at hand!"
