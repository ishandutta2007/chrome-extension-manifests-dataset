It is 2 to 3 times more common in sports that emphasize leanness, such as distance running. This plug-in's conception was motivated by research that found that the words \"weight loss\" or \"lose weight\" occurred on over 75% of articles that populated on Runners World and Competitor when \"improve performance\" was searched. These findings show that there can be an emphasis on body modification in order to succeed in runner; however, there is not enough emphasis on the negative effects of too low body fat. These side effects not only include contraction of the Female Athlete Triad but also worse performance.\nHopefully, this plug in can remove those body-focused words that encourage women, whether runners or not to lose weight or view nutritional fat as something other than fuel."
