URLI also supports three different types of shortcuts for every action.\n\nI want you to be 100% happy with URLI\nIf something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub and give me a chance to fix it and I promise I will. Thank you so much for using URLI.\n\nImportant Note\nIn order to update URLI to work with the latest Manifest Version 3, I needed to increase the permission level. I deeply apologize for the inconvenience. Please feel free to see the website (GitHub) for more information: https://github.com/sixcious/url-incrementer/issues/17\n\nFeatures\n• 4 Actions: Increment URL, Next Link, Click Element, and URL List\n• 3 Types of Shortcuts: Keyboard, Mouse (Multi-Click & Rocker) and Context Menu\n• Advanced Incrementing: Multi Incrementing, Date Time, Custom Base (Base 2-36), and Error Skipping\n• Auto Incrementing with Pause, Resume, and Slideshow capabilities\n• Shuffle URLs: Make it fun and randomize the next pages you see\n• Element Picker (Powered by ElemPick): To help you find the next link or click element, pick an element on the page and generate its Selector or XPath expression automatically or use the EP's buttons to traverse the DOM in any direction (May not work on complex websites)\n• Save settings for your favorite URLs\n• Toolkit: Generate Links, Open Tabs, and Crawl URLs (Requires Special Mode)\n• User Interface: A simple UI made with Material Design and Lit\n\nPermissions Justification\n\"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" - URLI needs to request this permission so that its content script can auto-activate on any URL you want to increment or auto-increment.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nURL Incrementer does *not* track you.
