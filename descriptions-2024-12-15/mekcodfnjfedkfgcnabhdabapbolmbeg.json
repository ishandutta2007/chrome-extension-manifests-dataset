Designed to work with another web3 injector extension and act as a intercepting bridge between user and web3 signer, such as MetaMask.\n\nAdding The Interceptor to a user's browser will automatically check transactions for various scams and mistakes as well as providing transaction simulation that is easily readable. Users can also explore web3 functionality without spending any money using multiple transaction simulation and account impersonation, allowing users to test behaviors of a web3 application prior to committing funds and transactions.\n\nThis extension does not store or use a user's private key, instead relying on another optional signer (such as MetaMask) to perform the actual signing actions."
