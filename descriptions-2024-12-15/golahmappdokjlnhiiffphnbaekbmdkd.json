(Among RPA solutions, applications such as UiPath and Microsoft Power Automation have also created and published similar extension packs for browser automation.)\n\nThis extension allows your actions within your Chrome browser to be automatically recorded and replayed through the AntBot application. It uses all popular technologies such as HTML, Java, etc. to enable users to automate tasks smoothly and quickly.\n\nTherefore, only users who have installed the AntBot Windows application (RPA) can use this package to perform browser automation. There is nothing the average user can do with this package alone.\n\nThis extension package can be used starting from version 2.1.5 of the AntBot desktop application.\n\nThis product does not provide pages that can be used independently."
