Caveat: Sequence lengths are the same across all banks. For example if \n     Sequence 3 on Bank 1 is set to 8 steps, Sequence 3 on all banks is now 8 steps(tut \n     mir sorry!).\n    -Sequences can be globally delayed. \n    -Sequences can be definitive or have random pitches or values. If random ceiling is \n     selected, the pitch or value of the first step acts as a ceiling to the random \n     values. In random floor mode, that value acts as a floor. \n\nNotes:\n\n-Want Polyphony? Output multiple sequences on the same  MIDI channel.\n-More sustain? Tie notes together to lengthen the duration of the preceding note. \n-Preview mode? Instantly plays a given step when any area (background, slider, etc) \n within the step is clicked. Best in ‘off’ position when adjusting parameters during live \n playback. Useful for original  programming of sequence.\n-Timing? Due to the the current design of JavaScript timing reliability is inherently \n disadvantaged and not reliable. Some measures have been taken to potentially minimize \n timing issues, but this is still an unfortunate reality. On the bright side, some really \n great gear from history has timing issues.   \n-Modifying/Jamming during playback? Go for it. All step parameters can be adjusted during \n playback. Also, sequence mute can be adjusted during playback. Sequence length, output \n channel, BPM and MIDI output device currently cannot be changed live. Changes take \n effect at the next cycle of the loop.\n\nKnown bugs:\n\n-After exporting a project, the displayed name of that project isn't updated. Names are \n only updated on imports. \n-Occasionally, there are crackles or pops during recording. While efforts have been made \n to minimize this and make the app function best on a wide variety of systems, it still \n occurs periodically. If the problem is persistent let us know."
