It helps in putting a name to right side overlay. Another overlay to mark site background based on what colour user selects.\n\nExtension also allows to store the frequently used scripts and any notes/todo for easier access.\n\nSelect dark colours as extension gets lighter shade and use it for overlay.\n\nI am in the process of learning chrome extensions and seen few other extensions as well as took help from ChatGPT. But I needed something very simple so created this extension. I hope it helps others as well."
