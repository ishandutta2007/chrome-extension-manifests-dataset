If you've ever searched for something as simple as a new phone cover, you probably ended up with at least 10+ tabs cluttering your address bar! 😵‍💫\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way...\n\nIntroducing \"Smart Groups\": A Smarter Way to Browse! 🌐\n\n\"Smart Groups\" analyzes your tab domains and automatically organizes them into neat groups based on unique categories—like folders on your phone. This feature leverages Google Chrome’s native grouping capabilities, meaning your browser looks the same, and performs the same, but your browsing experience is supercharged! 🚀\n\nHere’s how \"Smart Groups\" organizes your browser: 📁\n\n✅ Automatically groups your tabs based on domain categories (e.g., Social Media, Entertainment).\n✅ Groups all URLs from the same domain under a single group titled with the domain name.\n✅ Sorts created groups alphabetically for easy access.\n✅ Ungroups any group that contains only one tab to keep things tidy.\n✅ Auto-collapse groups that aren’t in use, keeping your tab bar streamlined.\n✅ Replace newer tabs with the exact domain with the older one to prevent duplicates. \n\n If \"Smart Groups\" has made your browsing experience smoother, how about making mine a bit sweeter? A cup of coffee would do! Just hit the \"Donate\" button in the extension popup. 😉"
