Instead blocking them all the time, it blocks only when you are working on the task. Reward yourself when the task is done.\n\nRetrospective - \"Focus tabs\" takes note of website you opened while you working on the task. You can look back at it, check where the time was wasted, then add the website into list blocked websites.\n\nTasks with a single goal - The best way to finish big tasks is by dividing them into smaller and easier tasks. When your goal is to \"Write a book\", start with task \"Write 500 words for 90mins\" then \"Write 1000 words for 90mins\" until finally you \"Publish my book\".\n\nNotes :\n- This is Alpha version, bugs are expected.\n- Everything is still running locally in your computer without database in outside. We are working on it.\n- Don't add any sensitive information!"
