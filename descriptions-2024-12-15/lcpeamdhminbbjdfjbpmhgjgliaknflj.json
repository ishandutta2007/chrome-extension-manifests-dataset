This extension provides backfeed for Facebook: it pulls back comments and likes from those sites to your own web site. See the Bridgy docs for more background and details.\n\nYour web site needs to support IndieAuth (indieauth.net). When you install the extension, it opens a Bridgy page for you to IndieAuth into your site. After that, it runs in the background, forwarding Facebook responses to Bridgy to send back to your site. You can see status info and poke it on the extension settings page.\n\nBridgy originally used Facebook's API to do this, but they later restricted that API. Fortunately you can still log into and use them legitimately in your browser, so this extension lets you send your own data to Bridgy, automatically.\n\nJoin the IndieWeb chat at indieweb.org/discuss to ask questions or give us feedback!\n\nWhat's new:\n\n0.7.0, 2024-01-03\n\n* Remove Instgram. Their anti-bot defenses have led them to suspend a couple people's accounts for using this extension, so we're disabling it out of an abundance of caution. Sorry for the bad news.\n\n0.6.1, 2022-09-18\n\n* Don't open silo login pages if they're not logged in. This ran at extension startup time, which was mostly harmless in manifest v2 since the background page was persistent stayed loaded, but in manifest v3 it's a service worker or non-persistent background page, which gets unloaded and then reloaded every 5m.\n\n0.6.0, 2022-09-17\n\n* Migrate Chrome (but not Firefox) from Manifest v2 to v3.\n\n0.5, 2022-07-21\n\n* Update Instagram scraping.\n\n0.4, 2022-01-30\n\n* Fix Instagram comments. Add extra client side API fetch, forward to new Bridgy endpoint.\n* Expand error messages in options UI.\n\n0.3.5, 2021-03-04\n\n* Dynamically adjust polling frequency per silo based on how often we're seeing new comments and reactions, how recent the last successful webmention was, etc.\n\n0.3.4, 2021-02-22\n\n* Allow individually enabling or disabling Instagram and Facebook.\n\n0.3.3, 2021-02-20\n\n* Only override requests from the browser extension, not all requests to the silos' domains.\n\n0.3.2, 2021-02-18\n\n* Fix compatibility with Facebook Container Tabs.\n\n0.3.1, 2021-02-17\n\n* Add Facebook support!\n\n0.2.1, 2021-01-09\n\n* Add more details to extensions option page: Instagram login, Bridgy IndieAuth registration, etc.\n* Support Firefox's Facebook Container Tabs addon.\n\n0.2, 2021-01-03\n\n* Add IndieAuth login on https://brid.gy/ and token handling.\n* Add extension settings page with status info and buttons to login again and poll now.\n* Better error handling.\n\n0.1.5, 2020-12-25\n\n* Initial beta release!"
