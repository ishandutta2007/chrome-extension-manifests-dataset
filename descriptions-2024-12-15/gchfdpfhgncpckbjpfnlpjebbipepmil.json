To make it easier to launch the web client, I recommend using the extension's 'Launch Meeting' button rather than the blue one that prompts to open the downloaded client. If that does not work, click the links below the button and cancel the download. A new link to take you to the browser version should appear. Click that one.\n\nIf emotes don't show up, open and close the extension panel.\n\nSince I added emotes individually, not all of them are available. The objects in content.js list all the currently supported emotes.\n\nFor instructions on how to use and contribute, visit the project's GitHub here: https://github.com/nadivgold/betterzoomchat.\n\nFeel free to make a PR to add your favorite emotes.\n\nThis was made for fun and not for commercial use. Please don't sue me thanks. \n\n\n---Changelog---\n0.0.3: Thanks to Yuriy Mikhailidi for the fresh UI update\n0.0.2: Bug fix and some more emotes added\n0.0.1: Initial release!"
