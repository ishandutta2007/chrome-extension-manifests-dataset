If a URL is not recognized on the whitelist, access will be blocked to protect users from phishing sites.\n\nCustomizable Whitelist\nUsers can choose to rely on our official whitelist, which includes over 90% of legitimate Web3 sites and most commonly used Web2 sites. Additionally, users have the flexibility to configure their own personalized local whitelist.\n\nInterception of Web3 Permit Operations\nUnauthorized Web3 Permit operations result in significant losses every day. By leveraging our Web3 Permit interception feature, users can effectively prevent accidental authorization of Permits, ensuring the safety of their crypto assets."
