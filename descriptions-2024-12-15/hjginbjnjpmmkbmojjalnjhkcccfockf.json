Optimize Your Website\n\nYour website is the biggest piece of your online identity.

Leverage Social Media\n\nSocial media can be a powerful tool when building a positive image. At the very least, most law firms have a Facebook page where they can share blog posts, connect with their audience, and stay top of mind.\n\nClients may scope out your profiles on social media before connecting with you. Your social channels often act as an extension of your website, so make sure you're presenting a cohesive, professional image.\n\nYou can explore other social media platforms and the benefits of each one. They're not all the same, and law firms should know which platforms are worth the time investment.\n\nHowever, just like your website, your social media profiles aren't helpful if no one sees them. If you have a low audience, considering using paid advertising to grow your followers and promote your content.\n\n3. Invest in Blogging\n\nBlogging can be a helpful marketing tool in many ways, but it can also help to build your reputation.\n\nMany law firms that blog do so for the SEO benefits. They also share the articles on social media and email marketing to drive traffic back to their website.\n\nIt's a good idea to partner with a content marketing company to help you get the most benefit from every post.\n\n4. Consider the Client Life Cycle\n\nThink about what the big digital marketing picture looks like. People who see your content might in different stages of the buying cycle. \n\nSome may have never heard of your firm before. Others may have worked with you in the past.\n\nIt's essential that you design your digital marketing for every stage of the client life cycle to ensure you're not neglecting a key piece of your audience.\n\nFind Your Digital Marketing Success!\n\nThere are countless ways law firms can create digital marketing success aside from the ones listed above. \n\nYou should explore every available opportunity to see what will give you the best ROI for your time, money, and effort.\n\nPowerLegalMarketing.com\n101 S.Elm St.\nGreensboro,NC 27401\n(336) 279-0466\n\n\nlaw, marketing, firm, clients, firms, business, content, practice, lawyers, brand, client, media, services, people, strategy, plan, time, seo, search, lawyer, results, way, market, site, goals, attorneys, blog, strategies, page, attorney, online, google, sales, efforts, work, ads, success, pages, facebook, service, law firm, law firm marketing, law firms, potential clients, social media, legal marketing, marketing plan, law practice, digital marketing, marketing efforts, new business, referral sources, marketing strategy, search engine optimization, practice area, new clients, search engines, legal services, practice areas, ideal client, prospective clients, blog posts, small law firm, social media marketing, target audience, marketing strategies, lead generation, marketing goals, law firm seo, many people\n\nsem, serps, search engine optimization, search engines, search, website traffic, digital marketing, search engine results pages, search engine ranking, ads campaigns, google, social media marketing, google search, integrated marketing, ahrefs, index, marketing, bing, backlinks, social platforms, analytics"
