It displays different problems solved by users, grouped according to difficulty, and provides a graphical representation of these problems based on their difficulty ratings. Additionally, it highlights unsolved problems, i.e., problems that have been submitted but not yet accepted.\n\nThe theme and appeal of the UI are aligned with the original Codeforces profile section's UI to minimize distractions and ensure a seamless experience.\n\nThe extension communicates exclusively with the Codeforces API and runs entirely in the browser."
