Our Site Scanner is designed to provide an easy way to feel a little bit safer about those sites.\n\nThe Site Scanner takes the website that you visit and checks it against our database. If it comes back as a hit, it displays a warning at the top of the website telling you that the website is reported as a scam.\n\nWe aim to spread awareness with our Site Scanner tool, so be sure to show others what this tool can do too!"
