Two reasons:\n- sometimes, because the title changed since the first time we saw a story, we click on the same story twice, and this is annoying (yes, in theory the link should be shown as visited, but not on a different device, etc.)\n- while moderation usually adds information and reduces clickbait, it sometimes also destroys information; it's nice to be able to read the title as the original poster intended."
