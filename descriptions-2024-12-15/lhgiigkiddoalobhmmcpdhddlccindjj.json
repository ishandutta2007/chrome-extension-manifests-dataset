If you're a teacher and you don’t have a Seesaw account, first go to https://web.seesaw.me to create a teacher account. If you're a student, ask your teacher to add you to a Seesaw class. Then use this extension to quickly capture screenshots and bring them into Seesaw.**\n\nBring the power of reflection to your students in two clicks. The Seesaw Chrome Extension gives students a quick way to bring work from any website into Seesaw for added layers of creative thinking and reflection. Students use the Seesaw Chrome Extension to capture work from their browser window and drop it directly into Seesaw's creative canvas for further annotation and reflection.\n\nSeesaw is a platform that combines 3 main things: student portfolios, an activity library for teachers, and family communication. Seesaw’s latest release features powerful new creative tools, optimized for students using Chromebooks. \n\nCreative tools are at the heart of the Seesaw experience for students. In the latest version of Seesaw, we’ve introduced new features that unlock more opportunities for students across all grade levels and subject areas to think creatively and reflect.\n\nSeesaw also works well with the full Google suite! Students add work from their Google Drive to Seesaw and then use Seesaw’s creative tools to capture their thinking, giving teachers better insights into student strengths and growth areas.\n\nTo learn more about how Seesaw, Google, and Chromebooks work together, visit https://web.seesaw.me/chromebook-features"
