When user clicks \"submit\", the Tab Grouper saves all URLs in the current window under a chosen name. This is extremly useful in the case where the user has a set of tabs that are necessary to perform a task. For studying, a user might frequently have their school website, email, e-books and some specific websites open. Opening all these different tabs before each study session is time-consuming, and can be replaced with the click of a button."
