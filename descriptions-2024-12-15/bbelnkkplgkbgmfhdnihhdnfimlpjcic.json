On installing it, when you view a property listing, the tool will give you data on that postcode district that would otherwise be time-consuming to calculate, such as...\n\n--> Average rental yield.\n--> Last five years of area capital growth.\n--> The average number of days it takes to sell in this area\n--> Buyer demand in the area.\n\nBuy your next property with confidence \n\nGet quick and easy investor-focused information on any property, listed on a portal of your choice and make informed, faster decisions about the property opportunities you choose to focus on. \n\nInformation is displayed directly on the listing you are looking at, whether you are searching on Rightmove, Zoopla or On The Market.\n\nThe data shown are sourced from reputable sources, including banks, the Land Registry and other, UK, government departments drawn together by a 3rd party data provider.\n\nProject background\n\nAs a property investment company, we were spending too much time shortlisting properties for our own projects because we weren’t getting enough information about the properties we were looking at, at the source. \n\nSo, we decided to sponsor the creation of this tool, so we could use it ourselves, freeing up time, for more important activities. It has been designed to give a user quick access to the numbers that matter.\n\nBecause we also believe, as Todd Stocker says, that helping others is the secret sauce to a happy life, we wanted to share what we’d made with the property investment community. \n\nAll feedback is welcome. You can get in touch with us at https://www.propertyinvestmentsuk.co.uk/contact/.\n\nDon’t be a stranger\n\nIf you find this tool useful and are kind-heartedly inclined, then please, please, please leave this tool a review or rating, here, on the Chrome Store. People saying nice things about this tool helps other property buyers find it and gives us a warm, fuzzy feeling when we see someone, out-there, appreciating it. \n\nFor more information see: https://www.propertyinvestmentsuk.co.uk/toolbar/\n\nPlease note that by clicking \"Install\", you agree to Property Investments UK’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nhttps://www.propertyinvestmentsuk.co.uk/privacy-policy/\nhttps://www.propertyinvestmentsuk.co.uk/terms-and-conditions/"
