One of the main reasons is because of weak passwords; this is the reason why even Google suggests users to \"Use 8 or more characters with a mix of letters, numbers & symbols\" for their passwords!\n\nThe problem with passwords like these is that they can get a bit hard to memorize. Would you really want to memorize a password like \"H3ll0!%0rlD\"?\n\nThis password generator offers a different solution. It generates passwords according to the XKCD 936 comic (https://xkcd.com/936/), where you just use a string of common random words (e.g. \"Battery Horse Staple\") for your password!\n\nPasswords like these are just as secure, and are way more easy to memorize!\n\nWith this extension, users can easily generate passwords just by using the popup when on pages to create accounts, and they don't have to worry about their passwords being stored!"
