From navigating page links, to paragraphs that go on forever, to clauses in ALL CAPITALS.......we could go on. \n\nTo make things worse, you either have to read on screen (cue red eye) or print them out (think of the trees!). \n\nWe also understand that, at least initially, you only need a few keys bits of information to get started. Like which jurisdiction applies, or if there are particular things you need to watch out for like unlimited indemnities. \n\nWatermelon gives lawyers the key bits of information they need from online terms and conditions in 1 click. \n\nThink of it as your head-start. With no printing, no red-eye and no scrolling. \n\nPlease note, Watermelon does NOT constitute legal advice. \n\nCOOKIES: Google's Analytics features allow us to access certain information about how Watermelon is used which, is obtained by using cookies.
