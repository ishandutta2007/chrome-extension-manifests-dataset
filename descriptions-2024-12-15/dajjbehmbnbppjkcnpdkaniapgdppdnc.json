Cupcake currently supports creating Snowflake connections. Learn more here: https://snowflake.torproject.org\n\nImportant Note: if you are being censored, Cupcake cannot help you on its own. Please install the full Tor Browser Bundle.\n\nWhen the censor has blocked direct access to the Tor network for a user, you can help. Installing Cupcake makes your browser into a flash proxy -- a temporary Tor bridge. After connecting with the censored user, your bridge allows communication between the user and the Tor relay, successfully circumventing the censor. Congratulations! You are a champion of internet freedom around the world!\n\nDon't worry about your IP address being blamed for the user's requests. The source of traffic will look like the IP address of a Tor exit relay, not yours. This protects both you and the censored individual.\n\n--------------------\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Tor, visit https://torproject.org to learn more. In short, Tor is a free service that protects privacy online. It allows users to avoid network surveillance, which threatens their privacy and freedom."
