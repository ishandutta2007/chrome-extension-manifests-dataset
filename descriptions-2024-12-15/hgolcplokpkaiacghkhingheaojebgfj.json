Too difficult to find where the link is. Why is there no simple seach bar?\n\n==Solution\n\nNaturally, based on the observation, let's build a AWS Launcher that has search capability to help easily launch specific AWS services console.\n\n==Features\n\n* Instant Search to launching AWS services - no more scanning the console home page to see where to click\n* Enter to launch first listed service - type and enter and launch - don't need to use the mouse to click and launch\n\n==Further Work\n\n* save state\n* MRU\n* settings"
