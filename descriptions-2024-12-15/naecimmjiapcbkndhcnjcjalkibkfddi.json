But what if there was a way to minimize this distraction while still being just as entertained?\n\nCue Cat Feed. Cat Feed, adapted from the Kill News Feed extension, is a Chrome extension that replaces all of that white noise from your friends and family and replaces it with a hilarious gif of a cat. After all, who needs friends when you have cats?\n\nThat's all there is to it! Start getting stuff done AND stay entertained right meow!"
