US, Canada, Australia and Germany in the works.\n\nAmazon isn’t always cheaper than your local bookshop – You could use Bookindy to ensure you’re buying at the cheapest price.\n\nBooks are sometimes out of stock on Amazon, but in stock at your local bookshop – You could use Bookindy to buy a book before it’s restocked on Amazon.\n\nBookindy uses a brilliant service for independent bookshops called Hive, who deliver books directly from the wholesaler. Whether you pick up or get it delivered, your local bookshop benefits. You could use Bookindy to support your local independent bookshop and never actually visit it! \n\nInstall and see for yourself."
