The lock is active only on the page on which you activate it, so you don't have to remember to release it when you're done.\n\nHow it works?\nWhen you are on the page, and you don't want your screen to go dim while reading this page just click the icon of this extension.\nThe lock releases when you:\n- go to another page\n- change tab in your browser\n- refresh the page\n- close/minimize browser\n- click on extension icon again\n\nHow to use on mobile?\nCheck Kiwi Browser - it is Chrome based mobile browser that supports chrome extensions\n\nWhy it is better that other similar extenstions? \nThere are some chrome extensions that work in similar way. They are great, but they don't work on mobile device  \n\nTechnical explanation\nExtension is using native browser api - wakelock, that was created exactly for this purpose.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/wakeLock  \n\nAttribution\nIcons used in this plugin are created by surang and were found on Flaticon website\nhttps://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/sleep"
