It's a single sheet of text with your progress automatically saved and restored between sessions â€” no file management to worry about here.\n\nRealnote doesn't want (or need) to replace your text editor, to-do app etc. With its original blend of utility & versatility, Realnote is the ideal springboard for all your writing on the go: drafts, notes, lists, ideas, thoughts etc. It's a pleasure to write in Realnote, and effortless to move the writing out. The extension contains both a light and dark theme.\n\nNew Features:\n- Now Realnote supports chrome side panel. (To use side panel click on the \"Show side panel\" button on top-right coroner next to pinned chrome extensions and click on dropdown and select Realnote.)\n\nThe Features:\n- Download notes into a text file.\n- Take screenshot for the notes.\n- Copy all text with one click.\n- Open an exiting text to view or edit and save.\n- Go Fullscreen to write and have more area to write. \n- You can use in light and dark theme.\n\nHow can I support the extension's development?\nThanks for asking!
