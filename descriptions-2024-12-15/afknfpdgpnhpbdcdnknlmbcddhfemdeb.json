There are no bells or whistles in this app. It's lightweight and just calculates percentages in the three most common ways. The interface is written in regular English so it is not complicated trying to figure out where to put the different numbers.  \n\nFor example, below are calculations it accepts: \n\nThe percent change from 10 to 15 is 50%\n10% of 100 of 10\n10 is 10% of 100\n\nFeedback is always appreciated!
