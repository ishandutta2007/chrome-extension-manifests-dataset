But due to hotkeys policy, which has 'suggestive' nature rather than 'must be', after installing this extension Chrome might decide to not apply some hotkeys. In this case I suggest you to go to Tools->Extensions then scroll down to the bottom of that page and click on 'Configure commands'. Set there:\n1) Alt+F for 'Open Tabs HotSpot'\n2) Alt+Shift+F for 'Switch back'\nThese hotkeys are suggested for better experience. However, you can set any hotkey you want, just keep in mind possible conflicts with existing hotkeys:\nFor Windows (https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=157179&topic=25799&ctx=topic)\nFor Mac (https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=165450&topic=25799&ctx=topic)\nFor Linux (https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=171571&topic=25799&ctx=topic)"
