Just highlight an artist’s name with that orange border (or by click-dragging to highlight the text, if the orange border won’t focus in on a name) then press the “A” key. Plus.Audio will search for that artist in Spotify and start playing a preview clip. If you’re interested, you can link to that artist’s page in Spotify to listen to more songs and learn more about that artist.\n\nThis is really helpful when browsing upcoming live shows on a music blog, an online concert calendar like SongKick, JamBase, or LiveNation, or even your favorite music venue’s website. Instead of just looking for artists you already know, you can quickly browse artists you haven’t heard of before and discover new music.\n\nI built Plus.Audio to connect people with good music, to help promote independent artists, and to generally make the world a better place. I hope you enjoy it and find it useful. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please email me at Dave@Plus.Audio"
