The extension is currently being used for Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, and Amazon.com.tr. When the extension is active, a button appears next to the product detail title, following Amazon's standards. Clicking this button, the extension accesses the product details and catalog information, and then uses generative AI technology to provide a summary of the product's sentiment in an audio format.\n\nIf more detailed information is desired, clicking the button again will result in a more comprehensive sentiment sharing. Additionally, if the user wants to stop the narration while it's in progress, they can simply click the button again to interrupt it."
