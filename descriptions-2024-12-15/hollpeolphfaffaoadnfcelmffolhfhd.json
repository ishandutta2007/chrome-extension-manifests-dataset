The game is still in pre-alpha, and will be receiving regular updates.\n\n### Features\n**1V1**\n\nCompete in 1v1 matches against your friends! Select your favourite character and fight! Defeat your opponent first or get the most damage before the timer runs out!\n\n**SURVIVAL** (Coming soon!)\n\nPlay by yourself or with a friend as you beat wave after wave of enemies. Get health packs to heal yourself up! Try to get the most kills to beat your highscore (or your friend's kill count)!\n\n**OBLITERATION** (Coming soon!)\n\nJust like 1v1, but with a twist! Win the game by getting more points than your opponent. Earn points by damaging your opponent, but be quick! After a small amount of time, your points will start ticking down.
