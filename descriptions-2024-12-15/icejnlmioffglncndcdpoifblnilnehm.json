When you visit one of our many partnered websites, you'll be able to activate afiliatree so that when you order from that store, we'll be able to plant trees on your behalf. We've made the process as convenient as possible for you! \n\nHow is this free?\nThe reason we are able to do this for free is because whenever you purchase from our partners, they will pay us a small commission which we use to plant the trees. We are part of the Awin Affiliate Program which lets us work with lots of different brands to help the environment.\n\nWhere are the trees planted?\nWe have partnered with WeForest who plant trees where they're needed the most. Places include Malawi, Ethiopia, India, Tanzania, Brazil and more.\n\nHow is shopping online eco-friendly?\nWe understand that a lot of brands still have a long way to becoming more eco-friendly, and that consumerism in general isn't great for the environment. However, we are also realistic and know that people won't stop shopping online any time soon, so our afiliatree chrome extension is a way to make shopping online that little bit more eco-friendly. \n\nWe welcome you to install our extension and join our movement!"
