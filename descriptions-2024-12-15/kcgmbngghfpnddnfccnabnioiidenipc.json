It’s hard to type everything you feel. So we procrastinate or worse, forget to respond. Thankfully, voice messages make this a whole lot easier. \n\n🤔 Why voice messages?\n\nAudio messages take the friendliness and ease of a phone call without the difficulty of scheduling a call and combines it with the speed of email without the drudgery of crafting the perfect response and tone. You can talk a lot faster than you can type!\n\n⚙️ How it works?\n1. Install the extension above.\n2. Visit Gmail\n3. Click the red microphone to the right of the send button to start recording.\n\nThat’s it. A link and image of a player will be inserted into the email and all you have to do is send that message to the recipient.  \n\n🙋🏾‍♀️ Who’s it for?\n\n👩🏿‍💻 CEOS/Entrepreneurs/Business Owners \nWhen you’ve got a million small things and tasks on your plate, replying to emails can be incredibly time-consuming and distracting. With audio, it’s a lot faster. \n\n👨🏽‍💼 Sales Reps \nSometimes you want to add a personal touch to stand out with your prospects. Voice can create a connection that written communication cannot.   \n\n👨‍🏫  Teachers and Educators\nIf feedback isn’t delivered in a tactful way, you can hurt and derail a student’s learning.  Plus, well-crafted, written responses take tons of time, vocalizing this feedback is far faster and friendlier.  \n\n👩‍💻  Marketers, Finance Professionals\nIt can sometimes feel like a chore to respond to long emails or financial reports. Beep allows you to distill what would be a long email into a brief message.\n\n👷‍♀️ Project Managers & Product Managers\nYou’ve got millions of details to manage and voice memos can convey more to your team in a shorter amount of time. \n\n👵  Seniors or People with Disabilities\nTyping can be difficult and time-consuming for people who aren’t super fast at typing. Make responding as easy as clicking a button. Plus seniors get to hear the voices of their loved ones. \n\n***Questions, Comments, or Suggestions***\nVisit our site at beepaudio.com or send us an email support@beepaudio.com\n\n***Disclaimer***\nThis app is not affiliated with or officially endorsed by Google or Gmail in any way"
