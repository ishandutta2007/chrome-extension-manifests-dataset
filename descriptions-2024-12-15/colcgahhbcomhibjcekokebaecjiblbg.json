It's perfect for meetings, lists or even reminders.\n\nTo make the content a little easier to navigate, you can format your notes, just like with any text editorâ€”use the buttons provided or just use the general keyboard shortcuts.\n\nIt stores the content to your local browser, so you're the only one who will ever see it, unless, of course, you use the export function. That will export the content to a .txt file that you can send to anyone you like.\n\nIt's new, it's light and new features will come with every update. Enjoy!"
