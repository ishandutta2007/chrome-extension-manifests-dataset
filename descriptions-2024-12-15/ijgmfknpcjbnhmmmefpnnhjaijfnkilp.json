This saves you time and reduced the amount of page scrolling that you need to do.\n\nThis also places the items in the same location, even while other extensions load preventing you from clicking on the wrong item on the page and allowing you to take action, if desired before all of the other extensions load.\n\nWe also made it possible to check on multiple check boxes in the \"Offer Refinement Box\" without having the page reload on you, between each click.\n\nAdditional Bonuses:\n- Shrink the size of the \"Can I list it?\" information Box.\n\nNEW FEATURE(s):\n- Allows the Refinement Box can be made smaller\n- You can resize Product Image\n- (In Alpha) Reduce/Eliminate Amazon's new \"side-in Offers\"  (Still a work in Progress)"
