Verified green hosting providers are organisations that can demonstrate they are taking steps to avoid, reduce or offset the greenhouse gas emissions caused by using electricity to provide their services.\n- If you are on a website already, rather than within search results, and want to quickly see if this site runs on green energy, simply open the extensions popup window from your browser to find out the websites hosting provider, whether it runs on green energy or not, and any supporting documentation.\n\n\nðŸŒ± Discover more about the websites you browse with additional premium features: - \n\n - If you have purchased a license key, and register it within the popup window, you will gain access to GreenCheck Plus, which grants you additional information on the websites you visit.\n - Whilst on a website, run a Carbon Analysis check, which will use yearly average grid intensity data from Ember, as well as marginal intensity data from the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), to calculate how much carbon that website emits every time it is reloaded. It can also identify other useful information, such as the number of requests that website is making to external sources, and provides information on how that website could lower it's carbon emissions.\n\n\nðŸŒ± About Us: \n\n- GreenCheck was created in June of 2024 in Scotland, UK, to help people understand more about how websites use energy, and how they could be responsible for deciding which websites (and their energy sources) to use. \n- This extension prioritises user privacy and security, ensuring that your browsing history and personal information remain confidential.\n- We will also strive to add additional features as we grow, and support our users with any queries they may have.\n\n\nðŸŒ± Changelogs: \n\n- [July 2024] - 0.1.0 - Beta version release, for getting early feedback from early users."
