There are some things it can't detect.\n\nIt's an imperfect solution to a difficult problem, but I hope it helps.\n\nIt can be used for TV shows, movies, sports teams, politicians, celebrities, curse words, or your ex's name.\n\nIt replaces them with \"[TEXT BLOCKED]\".\n\nIt does not collect any data on you or your browsing habits.\n\nIt should not slow down your browser; if it does, try using fewer keywords.\n\nPress the star button in the top right of the browser to change the keywords or turn it on and off. You might want to turn it off if doing something important, like banking.\n\nI'd be glad to hear if you liked it, or if you have suggestions for changes. I intend to update it with more features."
