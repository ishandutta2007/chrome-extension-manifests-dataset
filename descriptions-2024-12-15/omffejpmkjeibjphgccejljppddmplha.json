Developed with insights from Julie Dupouy, a world-renowned sommelier, this Google Chrome extension simplifies wine selection for anyone browsing recipes online.\n\nWhen you visit a recipe website, simply click on the extension to activate it. Wine Pair by sommifyAI will then suggest a range of wines, thoughtfully matched to complement the flavours and ingredients of the recipe you’re viewing. This is especially valuable if you’re among the 82% of consumers who rely on wine labels to make their choice.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that as we’re currently in MVP, the extension may redirect you to a Finnish website for wine purchases. We are actively expanding our geographic coverage to provide more localised options in the near future. Think of the wines we pair as silhouettes for what you should buy in your local store. Give us your ideas how we could best serve wine lovers around the world."
