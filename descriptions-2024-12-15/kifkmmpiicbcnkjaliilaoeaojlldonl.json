Keep the web decentralized and say “No!” to search engines that want to take control over the web.\n\nAMP pages are designed for small-screen devices and often don’t translate well to larger screens. The extension can be especially useful if you receive links from people who’re on their mobile devices while you’re on your desktop computer."
