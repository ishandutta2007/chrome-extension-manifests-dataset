The best anyone can hope to find is FCC data which is only accurate to the census block (i.e. an address search there will return the internet offered in the area, not what is offered at the actual address). Fiber Homes is connecting with individual internet service providers to build a dataset that is confirmed at the address level. With this extension, if a listing is in Fiber Homes database, it will return as a certified address. If the listing is not found, either a) it doesn't have a fiber internet connection, or b) Fiber Homes hasn't yet partnered with the ISP that serves that listing. In either case, FCC data is used."
