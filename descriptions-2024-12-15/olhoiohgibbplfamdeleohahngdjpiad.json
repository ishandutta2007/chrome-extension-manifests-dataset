The purpose of this extension is to help give perspective on the magnitude of these men's wealth.\n\nPlease note that this was programmed as a learning exercise. It changes the amounts only if the person's name is in the page title, and only adjusts dollar amounts in a certain format, for example \"$250 billion\", since this is the format most often used in articles like this. Exact figures such as $250,000,000,000.00 would not be changed, though those are very rarely seen in the types of articles I am attempting to work with.\n\nAny amount changed will be highlighted in light green, so you can see which figures have been changed and which have not.\n\nIt's just for fun! Am I making a statement? Yes. The battle is not left vs. right but rich vs. poor. We have far more in common with our friends on the other side of the aisle than we ever will with these men."
