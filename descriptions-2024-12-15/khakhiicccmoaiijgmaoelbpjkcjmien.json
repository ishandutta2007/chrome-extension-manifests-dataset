This extension provides handy tooltips when you hover over the names of U.S. senators and representatives, displaying their D.C. office phone numbers (as well as party affiliation and state). Quickly and efficiently let your legislator know how you feel about the issues.\n\nWhether it's to offer support of the latest filibuster or condemnation of the latest bill: make your voice heard!\n\nDial Congress requires access to the code for all web pages that you visit in order to mark any found congresspeople. For this reason, Chrome will warn you on installation that the extension can \"Read and modify all your data on all websites you visit\". Please note that we do not collect any personal information whatsoever. We do set data in your local storage, but only to maintain the active state of the extension between tabs and sessions.
