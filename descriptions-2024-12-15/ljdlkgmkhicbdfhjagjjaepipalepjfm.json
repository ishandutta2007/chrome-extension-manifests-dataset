Even allows you to paste an image from the clipboard!\n\nNote: This is my first chrome extension ever - please bear with me as I improve this app! This extension is developed by a third party and is not affiliated with Assembla in any way.\n\nPermissions details:\n* \"Read and change your data on api.assembla.com\" - because I need to talk to the Assembla API.\n* \"Read your browsing history\" - not an accurate description, but it means that I'm able to capture details about your tabs (only used to grab a screenshot.)\n* \"Capture content of your screen\" - well...that's the purpose of this extension, right? :)\n\n\nNote: For this first version, you will need to go to Assembla and retrieve your API key and secret. Future versions will implement oAuth.\n\nKnown Issues / Future Improvements:\n\n* Will be switching to oAuth for API Access\n* Currently only displays Active tickets assigned to you.\n* Ticket list order is erratic - will change to type-ahead search in the future."
