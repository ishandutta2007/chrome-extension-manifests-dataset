This extension counts squares owned by black & white as well as dead & neutral ones. In addition it also allows you to make & undo exploratory moves. \n\nOriginally I wrote this just for myself in an afternoon to learn about & play with Chrome Extensions. Full source is at https://github.com/KjellSchubert/GameOfAmazonsLittlegolem.\n\nKnown issues: after clicking 'start making exploratory moves' you can can click any queen to move it, so in theory you can move two black queens in a row. Also: I wouldn't be surprised if the extension stopped working some day after littlegolem.net deploys an updated web application."
