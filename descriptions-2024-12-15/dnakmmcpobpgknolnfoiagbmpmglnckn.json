Whether it's either offline or the website is currently broken, it can be frustrating if the content is not available. To avoid issues like this, there is a class of services that have sprung up which save copies of websites and allow you to visit them again later.\n\nArchive.ph (aka archive.today) and the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine are two such services.\n\nUse this extension to help prevent link rot and allow others to view archived versions of pages!"
