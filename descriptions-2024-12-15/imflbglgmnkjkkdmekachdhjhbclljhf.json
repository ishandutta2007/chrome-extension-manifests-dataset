For such cases, page refresh should help.\n- The plugin uses ~10 videos as a marker to know boundary for new and old content:\n  - If you remove subscriptions, you may lose all marked videos. In such a case, the plugin shows all videos as new.\n  - If you subscribe to more channels, then all older videos from this new channel are marked as read as well."
