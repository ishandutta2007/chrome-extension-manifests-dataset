Hide any non-commercial posts. Limit the feed to advertisements. Display only sponsored content and paid advertisements. Block user-generated content and filter out organic content. \n\nFacebook shows all posts and also ads only transiently. Optionally all the ads are permanently copied to a new tab. \n\nOptionally the URLs of the videos shown in ads are recovered and the videos can be downloaded using the standard Save video as... menu option.\n\nThe extension is turned on and off by clicking its icon. Non-ads can be reversibly hidden or highlighted. Highlighting allows users to appreciate the accuracy of detection.\n\nSeeing only sponsored ads on Facebook helps you focus solely on relevant advertisements. A feed filled exclusively with ads might be less distracting than a mix of organic posts and advertisements. It is easier to analyze the impact of your campaigns without the interference of organic content. \n  \nThe extension is free and open-source. Do not hesitate to suggest a feature."
