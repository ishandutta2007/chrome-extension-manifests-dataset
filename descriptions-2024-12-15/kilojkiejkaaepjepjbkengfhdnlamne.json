Timezoner is here to save the day! Timezoner will automatically converts times on websites to your local time. No more mental math or extra tabs.\n\nDisclaimer:\nTimezones are tricky.... and complicated. And because of that, it's not guaranteed the extension will work every single time. After all, there are numerous ways to specify a time with timezone. But, constant development is in progress to account for as many cases as possible. And if you face any issues where the extension is not working as expected, be sure to open an issue on github or just reach out in the support server."
