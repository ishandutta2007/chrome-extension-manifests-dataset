Upon clicking it you will see three buttons, two of which will popup with a citation for the website. The third, copy, will copy what ever the popup has to your clipboard. \nWhen the source citer is unable to find information for a specific category, such as author name, it will return AUTHORNAME in that position rather than leaving it blank so you can fill in the gaps.\n\nMade by Liam and Deniz."
