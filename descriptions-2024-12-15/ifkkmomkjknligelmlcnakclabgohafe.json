If you come up with new once please [report them](https://github.com/open-wc/mdjs-viewer/issues/new).\n\n### Warning\n\nIn order to function this extension modifies the CSP (Content Security Policy) for github.com with the following rules:\n\n- adds to script-src\n  - `'unsafe-inline'` to execute code blocks within the mdjs iframe\n  - `unpkg.com` to load user dependencies from within the mdjs iframe\n\n## Demos\n\nEnable the extension and visit the following pages\n\n1. [Readme of demo-wc-card](https://github.com/daKmoR/demo-wc-card)\n2. [Issues of demo-wc-card](https://github.com/daKmoR/demo-wc-card/issues/1)\n\n## How does it work?\n\nIt adds a button `show demo â–¹` to markdown pages and issues. Once you press it will get the raw md text which then gets pass though [mdjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdjs/core) and an extra plugin which replaces all imports (relative and bare imports) with [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) urls with the `?module` flag. This way all dependencies can be directly loaded in the browser without the need of any service.\n\nFinally we create an iframe with the content of the mdjs html and js output.\n\n## Limits\n\nIn order to get the raw md content of an issues (only the first message not following comments) a request to api.github.com is required.\nThis request is only needed if you actually click on the `show demo â–¹` button.\nThere is a hard limit of 60 anonymous api calls to github per hour.\nFor more an API key is needed. (You can not yet provide it to the extension ðŸ™ˆ - feel free to open a feature request)"
