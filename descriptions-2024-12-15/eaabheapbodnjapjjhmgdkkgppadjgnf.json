Each day a new word, including its definition and an example sentence.\n\nOur words are neither exceedingly narrow technical terms nor dazzling but largely hypothetical, like a word for a fear of cupcakes for example. They are proper English words that you theoretically could (although depending on your current audience not necessarily should) use in everyday conversation.\n\n\nUpon installation, the extension will add a small browser button. Clicking it will produce your daily word. It will never introduce itself unless you click the button. \n\nYou can click the button as often as you like, but a new word will only appear overnight. Each day has its own nugget of vocabulary, like a tear-off calendar."
