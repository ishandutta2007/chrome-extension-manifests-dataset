Just add the word stackoverflow on allowed searches. If you don't include the word stackoverflow on your google search, , e.g., css id not matching, this Blocked Search extension will block the search's results, you might be googling funny cats or latest gadgets instinctively! This extension will block that unproductive search and will only allow searches that pertains to stackoverflow, or other words or phrases added to the extension.
