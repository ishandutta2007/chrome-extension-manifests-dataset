Sometimes, it's far more convenient to have your new tabs open a certain distance away, left or right of the tab you're on a certain number of tabs away. \n\nThis extension helps you do that quickly and effectively by allowing you the option to customize commands you would like to input on your keyboard to open tabs from 1 to 9 tabs away, left or right of your current tab.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This extension will ONLY work if you customize the commands you want used to open your tabs. These keyboard shortcuts can be configured by going to \"Manage Extensions\" in Chrome and selecting \"Keyboard shortcuts.\" Configuring each command is necessary for the extension to work properly."
