From filtering inappropriate content to detecting signs of cyberbullying and self-harm, Deledao protects students online. Deledao can only protect students using iPads when students use the Deledao Education app. \n \nBecause iPads automatically launch webpages with Safari, teachers can download this extension to generate URLs that launch in the Deledao Education app instead. \n \nBy installing the extension, you agree to Deledaoâ€™s terms and conditions (www.deledao.com/eula) and privacy policy (www.deledao.com/privacy)."
