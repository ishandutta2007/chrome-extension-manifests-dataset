This can be different depending on how the font file has been named. Make sure to remove all spaces. \n\nType 'reset' to change the font back to it's original state.\n\nUse the filter buttons to choose which html tags are affected.\n\nWhen the filter panel is open, the filters will highlight the html tag of whatever element you are hovering on.\n\nWe hope this tool helps you! Any feedback or feature suggestions please email to hello@twomuch.studio\n\n\n\nBig thanks to OmseType for helping develop the idea and with testing.\n\nAlso thanks to abcdinamo, Open Type Foundry, NeubauLaden, Displaay, GrilliType, OmseType, PangramPangram, Elias Hanzer, Kometa, Camelot Typefaces, Tightype, TypeLab, Good Type Foundry, The Designers Foundry and  Velvetyne for letting us borrow your websites and fonts :-)"
