This extension is not affiliated with Tabroom.com in any way and is not supported by them.\n\nOne of the standout features of Tab Helper is its ability to provide detailed judge statistics. This feature enables debaters to gain valuable insights into their judges' preferences and track their history with different categories. You'll be able to see how many rounds they've judged of each category, the number of tournaments they've judged, and even the percentage of aff and neg votes they've given.
