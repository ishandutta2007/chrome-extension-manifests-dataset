If you prefer the full-screen app version, that is available in the marketplace as well at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bidgliphbkpjmmockfmojihnodbgonlp\n\nIt kind of tells time. It only exists because it looks cool telling time. Just leave it open and let passer-bys gasp in wonder as you proudly show off this awesome clock. This app is based on an Instructables that described building an actual word clock using LEDs. I thought to myself \"I could write an app like that\" so I did. This project was a learning experience on HTML5, CSS3, and JQuery."
