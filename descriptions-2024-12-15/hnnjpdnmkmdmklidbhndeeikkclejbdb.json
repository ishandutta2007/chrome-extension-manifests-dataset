It serves as an alternative to Amazon's SiteStripe tool, allowing Associates to generate affiliate links for any selected product. Although Amazon still provides this tool with text links, it has discontinued the image affiliate links.\n\nThis Chrome extension offers the quickest and easiest way to link to any Amazon product, insert your Amazon Tracking ID or Tag ID, and ensure you receive credit for all your referral commissions. You donâ€™t need to be logged into your Amazon Associate account to use this tool. It also doesn't require the Amazon API or other complicated steps.\n\nThis extension is so easy to install and use. It is extremely helpful for Amazon associates, content publishers, online marketers and marketing agencies."
