Unfortunately when your tab groups are collapsed, you can't tell how many tabs are in the tab group.  This extension fixes that.  \n\nThis extension adds a tab count to either the left or right side of the tab group title, with your choice of count distinction (parenthesis, square brackets, curlie brackets, etc), and can even skip adding the count if there is only one tab in the tab group.\n\nThis extension does not, and never will, read or store any information about any user activity.  It also does not, and never will, make any external requests or send any information anywhere other than the local computer it is running on."
