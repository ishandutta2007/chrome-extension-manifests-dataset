Adding classes to where they need to be is a pain. What if there was a way to add them automatically?\n\nIntroducing Connector Tool for the college course planning software, FlowChamp.\n\nWith this tool, you can select as many courses as you like from your FlowChamp flowchart, and with one click send them to be automatically added to PolyPlanner. \n\nAfter courses have been sent, visit PolyPlanner and confirm you want to add the specified courses. That's it! You've successfully filled out your PolyPlan."
