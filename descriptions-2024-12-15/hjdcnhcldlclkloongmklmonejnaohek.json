Place ‚Äì name of the property. (Ex. Hobbits spa & resort)  üó∫Ô∏è\n2. Location ‚Äì Middle earth üåé\n3. Timezone ‚Äì PST + 5.30 (10AM now)  ‚è∞\n \nIt's perfect to escape reality for a few moments every day and bring smile to your face. üòç\n \nüëâ HOW DO I USE IT?   \n\nDownload the extension (Duh!) > Open a new tab -> Choose \"Keep it\" from the popup. \n\nThat's all! Enjoy a new inspiration every time you open a new tab. \n \nüëâ WHY DID I BUILD IT? \n \nTravelux is a fun little weekend project that I have been personally using for travel inspirations for a while. I thought you'll find it interesting too ( my friends said so.) \n \nIn my free time, I used to checkout cool travel places to relax; often set those as \"Desktop pictures\" as aspiration. But finding these places used to take forever, so I started curating them with my friends and built a huge collection over time.  \n \nBesides, I was totally pissed looking at borrring new tab in Chrome; hence decided to build Travelux as a Chrome extension. \n \nThere are thousands of inspirations curated from across sources (Mostly Google, what I clicked while travelling, Trip Advisor, booking, Luxury Escape, MakeMyTrip among others). There's no affiliation and content is owned by their respective owners. \n\nüëâ PRIVACY POLICY\n\nTLDR; we don't collect any data but external tools (Ex. Google analytics) may need some.
