Then I can set the timer and if I do fall asleep then the tab will automatically close, so when I wake up I can open it back up from my history and it won't continue playing so far through.\n\nCan be great for saving your laptops battery life as well. As closing the video tab should hopefully activate the laptops automatic sleep schedule which before wouldn't be actived as a video would be playing."
