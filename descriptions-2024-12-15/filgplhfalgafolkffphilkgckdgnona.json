With Mark, tabs are automatically grouped by domain and sorted alphabetically so you can easily find them later.\n\nMark uses the native tab groups feature of Chrome, meaning there’s no learning curve to get started. Simply install Mark and any open and newly created tabs will be grouped and sorted.\n\nMark can be configured to only group tabs or only sort tabs depending on how you like to browse. Additionally, you can enable Mark to consolidate tabs across windows - meaning you won’t lose a tab because it’s hiding in its own window.\n\nYou can pin the extension to your browser toolbar by clicking the puzzle looking icon located in the top right of your toolbar, scrolling down to Mark, and clicking the “Pin” icon. Pinning the icon makes it easily accessible for clicking to manually organize tabs in cleanup mode, which will collapse any open groups.\n\nChange one of the configuration settings by right clicking on the Mark extension icon, navigating to the “Settings” menu, and toggling one of the settings. Depending on the way you would like to browse, customizing some things could make for an even better experience.\n\nIf you find yourself more curious about how Mark works or what other options and functionality are available, visit the “Resources” menu at any time by right clicking the Mark extension icon."
