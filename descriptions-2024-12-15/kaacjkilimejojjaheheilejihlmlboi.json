These themes effectively darken websites, but there are instances where images or light backgrounds persist, rendering the sites impractical for individuals with low vision. My extension tackles this issue by eliminating those problematic images and backgrounds while preserving important visual elements. Although it is possible that some websites may not be compatible with my extension, I have yet to come across one.\n\nAs a person with low vision, I rely on this extension every day. Once it is set up, you can simply forget about it.\n\nApplying a simple .CSS to modify the backgrounds of elements often proves ineffective on websites. To overcome this limitation, I employ various methods to bypass restrictions and display images that would typically be concealed with a custom style sheet.\n\nThe extension is freely available for anyone to use. If you wish to support my work, I have established a donation page accessible through a button in the extension's pop-up menu."
