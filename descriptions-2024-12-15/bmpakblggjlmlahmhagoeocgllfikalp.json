The Hashtagify extension makes it easy as pie to turn every single word in your Tweet into a hastag, so that people can find your content easier and you can reach people's hearts more.\n\nWe want you to Tweet to your full potential.\n\nAbout us\nThe Hashtagify team is growing every single day, ever since we successfully completed our seed funding. We are opening our offices in Silicon Valley soon, so keep your eyes peeled for that bright blue logo! Pop in for a few goodies from the team :)\n\nHashtagify was made with ðŸ’—, ðŸ˜­ and â˜• by the Hashtagify team."
