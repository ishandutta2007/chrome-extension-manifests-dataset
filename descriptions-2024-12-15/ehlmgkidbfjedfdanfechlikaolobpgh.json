Users can always turn it off or customize according to their preferences.\n\nAUTOCOMPLETE SUGGESTIONS\nThe user types a word, the feature automatically suggests the next word/short phrase based on the context.

Autocomplete is available for English dialects for now. Autocomplete speeds up writing and enhances business communication.\n\nSECURE SOLUTION\nWe consider the safety of your data as our highest priority‚Äîthat‚Äôs why we offer businesses on-premise deployment.
