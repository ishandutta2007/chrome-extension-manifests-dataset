It’s as simple as effective: You will reduce your social media usage just by becoming aware of it. one sec is the focus app that tackles the problem of unconscious social media use at its root. It is designed to change your habits on a long-term basis.\n\nYou just wanted to check that one message – and ended up scrolling for 30 minutes on Instagram? Social media companies use psychological traps to keep you hooked and spend as much time on their apps as possible. Time that could be spent so much better – with your family and friends, getting work done or for your hobbies and wellbeing.\n\nMany apps and tools block social media for a limited amount of time to help you focus. This might increase your productivity for the moment, but the real problem – your habitual urge to check apps and websites to get that dopamine boost – stays. \n\nThe one sec Chrome Extension is designed from ground up to keep your information private and secure. There are no accounts, no login, no tracking, no profiling. All data is stored offline, on-device, and only you can access it. I make money selling apps and subscriptions, not your data!\n\none sec is also available for iPhone, iPad, and Android Devices to block native apps and websites. More info on my website."
