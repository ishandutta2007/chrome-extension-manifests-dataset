By using our extension, we turn the Chrome web-browser into a digital signage solution.\n\nWhen the extension is activated, the current browser-tab is shown in full screen mode. The web-page is refreshed at a regular, user controlled interval, allowing content changes to become visible.\n\nWe have included the following recovery mechanisms:\n\n- When the page isn't loaded completely after one minute, a page refresh is initiated again. This allows the system to gracefully recover from connection loss.\n\n- When the web-address changes after an automatic page refresh, the original page will be loaded again after one minute. In this way the extension recovers when a website is placed in e.g. under maintenance mode.\n\n- When the Chrome web-browser is launched, the extension creates a new tab and shows the content on the specific web-address if it was still activated previously. By automatically starting the web-browser at system start up, this feature allows to recover from a (sudden) system reboot. \n\nThe narrow casting extension can be started (and stopped) using the pop up window that is shown when clicking the browser action. The user is able to configure the refresh interval and specify whether the content should be shown in full screen mode. The pop up window also shows the current status of the narrow casting process.\n\nIn case of a (sudden) system reboot, the narrow casting solution is able to continue when the Chrome browser is restarted. In order to do this, let the Chrome browser automatically start when the operating system is booted."
