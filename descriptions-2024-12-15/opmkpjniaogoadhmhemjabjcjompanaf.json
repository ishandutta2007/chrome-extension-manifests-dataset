Default at the moment is 1 PVU:105 LE when selling, but it might change in future.\n\nPatch Notes v1.0.4\n   - Fixed issue where code wasn't executing due to imprecise path match.\n\nPatch Notes v1.0.3\n   - Added input to select the PVU:LE ratio as it's constantly changing\n   - Added new way to calculate profit by amount of seeds you can buy per month with that specific plant.\n   - Fixed overall bugs.\n\nPatch Notes v1.0.2: \n   - Added BNB to PVU conversion.\n\nPatch Notes v1.0.1: \n   - Fixed bug where it wasn't loading properly the data on marketplace and had to refresh multiple times in order to display it."
