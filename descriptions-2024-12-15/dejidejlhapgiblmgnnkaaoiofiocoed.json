Whether it's because you're working for a startup who hasn't launched yet or you're working with a client who doesn't have an established brand, there are plenty of times when you'd like to be able to reference the colors from your client's website so that you can create something that matches their style. \n\nChromatics solves this problem by providing users with an interface where they open the extension on any url and view all of the colors used on that page. The user can then choose which ones they want to save for later, which makes it super simple for them to find any color palette they need without having to dig through their entire site looking for it!\n\nDesigners: Whether you're working on a new brand or collaborating with clients who don't have any established branding yet, Chromatics will help make your job easier by allowing you access to all of the colors they've chosen while also giving you"
