The only real difference is in our business model. Instead of spending money on marketing we partner with nonprofits to get ourselves known and in return share our advertising income with them. KindSearch makes supporting your favorite organization super easy - use it when you are looking for something online and we automatically donate to the organization of your choice. \n\nBy clicking \"Add to Chrome\", you accept and agree to install the KindSearch Chrome extension, set the Chrome new tab and default search to KindSearch powered by Bing, and adhere to the Terms of Use (https://kindsearch.org/terms) and Privacy Policy (https://kindsearch.org/privacy)."
