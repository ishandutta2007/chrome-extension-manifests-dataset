Reinvented our extension design, functionality, and user experience\n2. Implement auto-save last notebook/folder, so no need to re-select your notebook/folder if you don't want to.\n3. Improved screenshot feature to allow for saving the entire visible screen area\n\nTUTORIAL VIDEOS:\nTo watch tutorial videos, please visit our YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoVKPRvMklZ6qatYA5Jgmxre6ITqXAzNu \nYou could also visit: https://mycanopie.com/features or \nhttps://mycanopie.com/faqs-%26-tips to learn more\n\nFind it. Save it. Use it. Research smarter and write better papers with Canopie! FREE to use.\n\nCanopie enables users to quickly capture, organize, bookmark, AND CITE their online research in one place for a more efficient, effective, and visual research-saving workflow.\n\nCanopie helps college students do smarter research for papers by creating a bookmark from either:\n> Highlighting text, or\n> Taking a screenshot\n\nNext, users can save their bookmark as a note, complete with:\n> Website URL\n> Citation info\n> Personalized tags\n> Added comments \n> 5-Star rating system\n\nCreate an organizational flow to your saved notes with Notebooks and Folders, personalized to specific classes or assignments, even using this feature as a \"framework\" to fill in according to a paper's outline.\n\nShare notebooks and folders with other Canopie users and work collaboratively as a team.\n\nOnce tagged and/or annotated, come back to your Canopie Dashboard to put it all together. Canopie's visual, annotated style of saving your online research is far better than just saving a bookmark or keeping a bunch of tabs open. Knowing why you saved something makes it massively more efficient to put it all together for papers/ projects later.\n\nIMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTICE:\n> Please note that OCCASIONALLY when clicking into the pop-up icon after users highlight text, users will see a new, full-screen tab pop up instead of the normal top-left-corner popup screen. If this happens, please close and relaunch Chrome browser. If this problem persists, please reach out to support@mycanopie.com.\n> While Canopie's extension popup works on most websites, please note that some websites have conflicting code that results in the extension popup not functioning properly. \n\nFEATURE REQUESTS:\nAt Canopie, we welcome any feature requests to help us improve your user experience!
