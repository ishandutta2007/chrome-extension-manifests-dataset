Users can configure the extension to block the application when a new instance opens or block access when the computer is inactive for some time. The extension uses a master password to unlock the screen and only stores the SHA-256 hash of the password, not the actual password. It serves as an additional layer of protection for the Skype Web and does not block Skype itself, allowing incoming calls to still be received but requiring the user to unlock the screen to answer. Users can also use the built-in blur filter to optionally filter Skype's content to prevent it from being exposed on the screen when not in use. To improve usability, users can click on the action button to open a new blocked Skype Web or focus on an already opened one. The extension will block existing instances as soon as the toolbar button is pressed. The users can assign a keyboard shortcut to do the same. \n\n--Legal\nThis project is an open-source project that aims to improve the privacy of your Skype Web usage and has nothing to do with Skype itself."
