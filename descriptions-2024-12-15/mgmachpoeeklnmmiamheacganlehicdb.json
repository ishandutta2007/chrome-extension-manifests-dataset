We also have more information available here:  https://www.miaprova.com/blog/adobe-target-chrome-extension-brought-to-you-by-miaprova/.\n\nACTIVITIES tab: Here, Adobe Target users can easily see what activities and experiences they are members of as they traverse their digital properties. They can also see what other activities are mapped to their Adobe Target ID, which is very helpful for understanding cross-test participation.  \n\nTarget users will also see the data communicated to Adobe Target and a response from Adobe with the order of activities and offers execution for QA purposes. MiaProva also makes the offer code available for easy consumption.  \n\nThe premium feature on the Activities tab is that MiaProva customers can access reporting for any live Adobe Target Activity managed within MiaProva. MiaProva users can also upload test screenshots to those tests within this tab.  \n\nPROFILE tab:  This tab gives Adobe Target users a window into what Profile Attributes and values are associated with their Adobe Target ID. This feature creates an incredible opportunity for Adobe Target users to become more familiar with what Profiles are and how to use them for their personalization efforts. You can view all of your attributes within this tab, add additional attributes (helpful for many reasons!), and edit any of your current non-user—profile attributes.\n\nID tab: Users can quickly see and copy any visitor ID values used in their optimization efforts. We purposely put the mbox3rdPartyId or 1st party ID in the first spot to highlight this underutilized component, which allows Adobe Target users to coordinate tests across devices and use all the rich data available in internal databases.\n\nIDEAS tab: Premium Feature—MiaProva's Chrome Extension is directly linked to end-user MiaProva accounts. Users can add test ideas in the context of their site and research. MiaProva will communicate ideas submitted here to its Idea Board for voting and prioritization. Subscribers to new ideas will receive an email letting them know.  \n\nREPORTS tab:  Premium Feature - MiaProva customers can access their test results via MiaProva's Adobe I/O integration. MiaProva also provides lift and statistical confidence calculations and makes them available here.  \n\nThank you for checking out the MiaProva Chrome Extension. We would love any feedback, thoughts, or ideas you may have. Please contact us at support@miaprova.com, and we will respond immediately."
