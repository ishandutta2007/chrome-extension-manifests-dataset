However, the platform's increasing emphasis on promoting \"Member-only\" paid articles poses a challenge. This approach not only prioritizes paid content over freely available articles but also inadvertently marginalizes readers from third-world countries, the financially disadvantaged, and those simply seeking open access to information. The result? A diminished visibility for free posts, creating an unfair landscape for both readers and writers of free content.\n\nOur Solution:\nThe Medium Member-Only Post Remover extension aims to democratize your reading experience. By seamlessly removing \"Member-only\" articles from your feed, this tool ensures that free, accessible content gets the spotlight it deserves.

The extension automatically identifies and hides \"Member-only\" articles as you browse Medium, ensuring your feed is filled with freely accessible content. There's nothing to configure—just a cleaner, fairer Medium at your fingertips.\n\nJoin Our Cause:\nIf you believe in an open and equitable internet—where access to information isn't dictated by financial barriers—Medium Member-Only Post Remover is for you. Support our mission to make free content more visible and available to everyone, regardless of their background or financial status.\n\nEmbrace a Medium that's open for all.
