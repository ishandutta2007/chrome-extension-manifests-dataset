It's sometimes annoying when you are browsing through meme Facebook groups, and you see a funny video that you would like to share with a friend... but you can't. Exactly that case pushed me to create the Video Share extension that lets you download or get a sharable link to any video in any closed Facebook group.\n\nHow to use it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ZawItBJow\n\nIMPORTANT!\nAfter installing the extension, you should restart your browser or at least browser tab.\n\nFor your information:\n\n1. Facebook video URL expires after a few hours, and you won't be able to watch the video from that link anymore. However, you can generate a new one and share it again.\n\n2. The extension only supports downloading videos from closed Facebook groups right now. However, I might extend the functionality to support more cases in the future.\n\n3. If you find any bug, let me know by creating an issue in my GitHub repo. I will be happy to help you :)\nLink: https://github.com/mdrazyk/video_share/issues"
