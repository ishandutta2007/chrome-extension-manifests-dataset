It provides a visual enhancement to the Make interface by applying color-coding to the filter selection, which improves the platform's usability and the user's productivity.\n\nWhen you're working with filters on the Make platform, you may have noticed that different filter types - numeric, array, date, and others - often have the same title (e.g., 'greater than', 'equal to'). This can make selecting the right filter a less-than-intuitive process, especially when you're working quickly or dealing with complex projects.\n\nOur extension solves this problem by applying color-coding to these filters. By injecting custom CSS into the pages of the Make platform, the \"Make Color-Coder\" extension assigns a unique color to each filter type. This way, at a glance, you can immediately distinguish between numeric, array, date, and other filters, making your selection process significantly more efficient and reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\nFor instance, numeric filters might be highlighted in blue, array filters in green, and date filters in red. This visual differentiation allows you to identify and select the correct filter with ease and speed.\n\nThe \"Make Color-Coder\" extension operates solely within the Make platform, and it is specifically tailored to enhance the user experience on this platform. It requests minimal permissions, including \"activeTab\" to modify the CSS of the current Make tab, and host permissions for \"https://.make.com/\" to operate on the Make platform. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data, ensuring your privacy and security while using the extension.\n\nIf you're a frequent user of the Make platform and often find yourself navigating through numerous filters, \"Make Color-Coder\" can be an essential tool to enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow. Download the extension today and experience the difference that a touch of color can make!"
