The flashing and the sound will continue until the reset time has elapsed. \n\nIt can be manually stopped by pressing stop button. Once set, the input values will be saved and used next time until they are changed including the setting of volume slider. \n\nIt gets the idea from the 20-20-20 rule guideline to help reduce eye strain and fatigue that can occur from prolonged screen use. It suggests taking regular breaks to rest your eyes.\n\nThe rule is simple: Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something that is at least 20 feet (or about 6 meters) away from you. This allows your eyes to refocus and relax, reducing the strain caused by staring at a screen for extended periods.\n\nThe 20-20-20 rule is particularly useful for those who spend long hours working on computers, laptops, or other digital devices. It helps prevent eye discomfort, dryness, and fatigue associated with extended screen time.  \n\nWe set the default for 0.33 minutes rest but the longer the better for the eye ( we recommend at least 1 minute )"
