It provides password management and other ancillary services to help you manage your and your clients' GST filings.\n\nIt is an easy-to-use, highly-secure, and efficient tool meant for Optotax users.\n\nThis extension creates, manages and provides access to your encrypted vaults (or lockers) so that you can securely manage and use own or your clients' credentials while logging in to different accounts (with GSTN portal, Optotax service or anywhere else). \n                \nOptotax does its best to recognize which site you're browsing and suggests possible logins for it.\n\nWhen presented with a login form, Optotax will attach login buttons to help you log in to the service without having to remember any complex passwords for different accounts that you manage. Keep your master password safe and let Optotax protect your all other passwords.\n\nYour username-password that you save with this extension never leave your computer without first being encrypted with your master password. What this means is - even in an extremely unlikely case that someone gets unauthorized access to your vault data they will not be able to decrypt or unlock it without your master password -- which always remains with you and is not stored anywhere."
