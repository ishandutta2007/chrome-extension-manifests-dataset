When they are uploaded, we assign them a unique GUID and URL.\nThe 360 pictures are also represented as 3D arrow-shaped objects in the modeling software.\nWe include the GUID as properties to these objects and with an addin in the modeling software (Autodesk Revit), clicking on the 3D element opens the picture in the browser.\nAutodesk also has its cloud platform to work collaboratively on 3D models. Models can be viewed in the browser on their ACC platform (Autodesk Construction Cloud) and access object properties, such as the GUID.\nOur Chrome extension reads the GUID property of the objects, transforms it into a URL and opens the 360 picture in the same browser, using our modelical.io platform."
