Don't spend time looking through your calendar, or trading emails back-and-forth to negotiate what times work. \n\nInstead, just click on Calvailable, choose the length of your meeting, and it will check your calendar for all available time slots so you can copy/paste them in immediately! \n\nChoose how far out to show times for, whether to include weekends, and also takes into account your working hours so you don't accidentally propose meetings before or after you want to.\n\nGreat for when your recipients are intimidated by more elaborate scheduling links such as Calendly."
