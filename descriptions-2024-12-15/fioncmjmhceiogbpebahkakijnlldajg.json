You don’t need to have read the book to be able to use the plugin. It is for all people struggling to make behavior changes, keep their resolutions, or make consistent progress towards their goals.\n\nThe concept is to be mindful about every small decision, because every decision matters—it can be either a +1 towards your goals, or a -1. Self-discipline is difficult because in our daily life we often make decisions by habit or impulse, without considering the long-term consequences. This simple practice of labelling every decision as +1 or -1 will give you the awareness you need to live your life more in harmony with your aspirations and highest values."
