With today's tasks you will know what to focus on without having every idea you ever had clogging up your list. The backlog makes sure that you won't forget your best ideas.\n- A button to clear today's tasks, both completed and pending. This is the only way to remove completed tasks from the list, encouraging frequent use. This feature guarantees that no task remains in your daily task list indefinitely.\n- You can star one of your tasks, but only one. There can only be one priority."
