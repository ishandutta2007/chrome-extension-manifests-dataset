What will you do when you're required to see if a certain phrase is there within 10 seconds? How will you deal with it? It's too much effort to scroll all the way down, click a button, then go control-F. That's why we have this extension. Just google any phrase with \"lyrics\" in it and the song's lyrics will be automatically extended, assuming Google is providing the lyrics in the first place."
