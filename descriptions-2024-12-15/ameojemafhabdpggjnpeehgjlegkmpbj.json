A free Chrome extension that uses GPT as a personal chatbot assistant for helping you solve leetcode problems. You can ask it questions about any leetcode problem you are solving.\n\nWhy LeetCodeGPT? The coding interview is the most important part of the internship/job process, and solving leetcode problems is the best way to prepare for that. LeetCodeGPT has complete access to any leetcode problem you are solving and is explicitly designed for solving leetcode problems. LeetCodeGPT automates the process of feeding information about a leetcode problem into GPT, so you can focus on solving your leetcode problem and asking LeetCodeGPT any questions you have. \n\nHow does LeetCodeGPT work? After installing the extension and launching LeetCodeGPT, simply navigate to a leetcode problem, open the popup, and ask any question you have about the problem. Your conversation is automatically saved, you can clear it, view or copy code produced by GPT, and ask it any question about the leetcode problem you are solving.\n\nWhy did I build LeetCodeGPT? The coding interview is arguably the most important part of your interview process, given you get the interview first. Succeeding in the interview is not easy, and that's what LeetCodeGPT is supposed to do: improve your coding skills by helping you solve more leetcode problems!"
