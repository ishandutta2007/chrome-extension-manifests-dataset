I acknowlegde that I do not own their respective trademarks. This extension was developed for personal use and shared for others to use, if they wish to.\n\nThis extension adds an unread count badge to the taskbar/dock icon of a PWA* Gmail**/Outlook** app. The app supports multiple Gmail**/Outlook** PWA accounts. Multiple account badges only work when each PWA is installed using a unique Google** Chrome browser profile that is setup with the unique Google** Account that you wish to access Gmail**/Outlook** emails with.\n\nPlease note: this extension does not work, as intended/expected, with multiple Gmail**/Outlook** accounts within the same Google** Chrome browser profile, if each PWA is installed using the same Chrome Profile, it will show the unread count of each account on the same PWA taskbar icon by cycling through each account dependant on when you opened the PWA account on your device. So, please ensure you install multiple instances in separate Chrome Profiles.\n\n(Windows) How to install a PWA in Google** Chrome:\n1. Navigate to the Gmail**/Outlook** URL, i.e. go to your Gmail**/Outlook** Inbox.\n2. Click on the Google** Chrome browser settings button, â‹® .\n3. Click on menu option, \"More tools\".\n4. Click on sub-menu option, \"Create shortcut...\"\n5. Name the shortcut, e.g. GMail**/Outlook**.\n6. (NB!) Ensure that you check/tick the checkbox labelled, \"Open as window\".\n7. Once the new GMail**/Outlook** window opens, remember to pin the PWA to your taskbar to ensure that the extension adds the unread count to the pinned icon on the taskbar.\n8. In Windows** 10 and 11, ensure that the Taskbar setting, \"Show badges on taskbar buttons\", is toggled on (i.e. enabled) to allow the unread count badge to be shown on the Windows** Taskbar.\n\nOnce you have successfully made use of the extension, could you please rate it, and if you have any feedback, it will be appreciated too. This will give me an indication on whether or not I should enhance this extension further.\n\nI hope that this small extension helps you in some way, enjoy.\n\n*PWA, Progressive Web Application.\n**The trademarks mentioned are owned by their respective owners and Ocfinity and/or this extension are not affiliated with these companies.\n\nUpdates:\n2023-01-24 (0.2.6.5)\n- Added support for Slack** PWA. Enable or disable the Slack** support using the extension options.\n\n2022-12-30 (0.2.4)\n- Merged the extensions that were created for Gmail** and Outlook** into a single extension with the ability to enable or disabled each through the extension's options. Please ensure that the apps are enabled in the options if you are experiencing issues with this extension displaying the unread counts on the taskbar/dock respective icons.\n\nBug Fixes:\n2023-01-24 (0.2.6.5)\n- Addressed issue with saving extension options.\n\n2023-01-09 (0.2.5)\n- Fixed the storage of the extension options settings that prevented the unread count remaining after a single count update was done."
