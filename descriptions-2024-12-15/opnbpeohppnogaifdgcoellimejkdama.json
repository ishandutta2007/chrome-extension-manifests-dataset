As a leading edge content creator, you need to be focused on the rising and top keywords related to niches that make up your area of interest.\n\nThe Trending Keywords Hunter analyses the on-page text and shrinks the keywords to their roots and shows you the frequency with which they are used on any web page that you are on.\n\nYou can select up to 5 such keywords at a time and analyze their search trend and that of any associated top or rising keywords to uncover insights related to your market with Google Trends.\n\nOnce you have identified your target keywords you can find their actual search volume in your target geography with www.tachitools.com (paid membership required).\n\nWe also provide you with the ability to download all the root words being used on a text page to a CSV format with the count of the number of times such a keyword is being used.\n\nIn order to bring you back the keywords of relevance we eliminate some \"stop\" words that are commonly used in the English language but do not actually relate to the main concept of the page."
