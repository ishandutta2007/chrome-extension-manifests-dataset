The Music Beta icon is displayed naked otherwise.\n\nThe omnibox command prefix mc (for Music Controller) followed by <space> or <tab> gives access to four commands 1) Skip (sk), 2) Restart (rs) 3) PlayPause (pp) and 4) Foreground (fg) to bring the Web App tab to the foreground. These commands are available in the suggest menu.\n\nYou might also be interested in getting the related Music Beta Skip controller here:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lfpilffkipfhpoccjdiebpdjbdmfpefg\n\nYou can find more detailed user documention about the extentions here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/music-beta-controller/wiki/UserDocumentation\n\nThe code for these extensions is open source and available here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/music-beta-controller/\n\nYou can see what was added to individual releases here:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/music-beta-controller/wiki/ReleaseNotes\n\nYou can file bugs and feature requests here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/music-beta-controller/issues/list\n\nYou can use this other group to discuss usage of these extensions:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/music-beta-controller-discuss\n\nAnd you can register to this one for communicating with other users of these extensions:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/music-beta-controller-users"
