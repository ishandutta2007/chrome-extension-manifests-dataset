It can be based upon a set topic or can be any material chosen at random. A mood board can be used to convey a general idea or feeling about a particular topic. They may be physical or digital, and can be effective presentation tools.\" [1]\n\nThe extension adds a new option in the browser contextual menu to \"Add an image to a moodboard\". That option appears when you right click anywhere on a website. The first time you must \"Add it to a new moodboard\" and introduce a name for it. Latter on you may add the image to an existing moodboard or create a new one. If no image was found in the exact position where you right clicked, nothing will happen.\n\nThe \"Quick moodboards\" button on the main browser toolbar will open the moodboards. That view is still quite limited. Use the first icon (top left) to select the visible moodboard. You can move images around freely. Click an image to bring it to the front and press `delete` key while it is selected to remove it. Moodboards are saved automatically. Notice there is no do/undo functionality.\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_board"
