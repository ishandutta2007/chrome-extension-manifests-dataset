But, what if you could make that number instantly drop down to 0, in just two clicks? And, what if you got PAID in the process of this all? \n\nThese are the questions we asked ourselves when we first started Tabbr - the free Chrome Extension that does all of that. If this sounds too good to be true, read on!\n\nOur Chrome Extension is stupidly simple. With every new tab you open, instead of seeing the boring old Google screen, you'll see Tabbr, along with some unobtrusive ads on the bottom corner of the screen. With each website you search, question for google, or new tab opened, you'll be making a tiny amount of money with the ads!\n\nOur finances are, surprisingly, super simple. From the tabs you open, Tabbr keeps 10% (most of which goes back into marketing), you personally keep 10%, and the other 80% (wow!) goes directly to our hand-picked charities, including One Tree Planted and The Clean Air Task Force.\n\nBy now, you can see our vision and how truly simple this project really is. Think about it - if every person in the world installed Tabbr, our global CO2 emissions would drop to 0. Crazy!\n\nIf you like the idea of helping your planet (and your wallet), take the two-clicks and install our free extension now. It'll be worth it - we promise!"
