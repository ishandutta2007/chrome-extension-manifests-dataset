This plug-in is the chrome extension version and is useful for G-suite and Outlook Web Access. The Netarx Sensor is a separate app that is used for the thick version of Outlook and can be found on our website at netarx.com/home\n\nBy installing the Netarx Plug-in or Netarx Sensor on end-user devices, we can display a confidence value of a userâ€™s identity on all of your typical communication apps. We represent that confidence value on screen into a visual traffic light indication of threat:\nif the communication is safe, it will be green\nif there is a possible warning it will be yellow\nIf there is an alert it will be red\n\nThere are dozens of inputs currently go into our AI/ML models and eventually there will be hundreds. A few are highlighted below:\nFrequency of communication\nEmail headers, DNS, SPF, DKIM\nDevice fingerprinting\nUser knowledge\nGeo-location\nIP Address\nModality / Communication type"
