However, it only displays a name and a part of a thumbnail image for each card. Unless you have every Splinterlands card memorized, you have no idea what half your opponent's cards were.\n\nThe Splinterlands Battle Advisor displays every card played by name, with special abilities, health, speed, and so forth listed out for you. It breaks down your opponent's attacks, so you can see if they concentrate attacks on the tank, perhaps, or maybe on sneaking damage. It shows you whether they favor melee, ranged, or magic attacks. You can even refer to the Battle Analysis popup while you're building your team to make sure you're truly prepared for what's coming at you."
