Logins\n2. Emails\n3. Credit Cards\n4. Bank Accounts\n5. Private Notes\n6. Servers\n\nPasswall has a 4 layered encryption architecture.\nLayer 1: A secure hash (master hash) is generated from your master password.\nLayer 2: All your logins and passwords are encrypted on the client side with master hash. This ensures that passwords can only be decrypted by you.\nLayer 3: With end-to-end encryption feature, all data sent from the client to the server is also encrypted during the transportation with an always changing transmission key.\nLayer 4: Finally your passwords are also encrypted with server hash just before saving them to the database.\n\nPasswall is an open source software. The source code for Passwall is hosted on GitHub and everyone is free to review, audit, and contribute to the Passwall codebase."
