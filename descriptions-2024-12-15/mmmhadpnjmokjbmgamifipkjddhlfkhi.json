There are three kinds of wormholes you can create:\n\nRedirect - Takes you to a more productive site which you specify\nQuote - Shows your most motivative quote\nTimer - Displays the time you've spent on the site today\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n3.0 is out! Feb 2, 2020\n\nFixed the issue with not able to block website that uses service workers such as Twitter. \nTimewarp is now part of Mindful Suite! Thank you for your support. We'll make Timewarp better!\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2.6 is out! Mar 23, 2015\n\nBy request, you can now turn off social buttons, that's one less distraction!\nBut we do appreciate sharing Timewarp with your friends. It's the only way to help us do a better job updating Timewarp! Good luck!\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2.0 is out! July 18, 2015\n\nThanks everyone who suggested features and found bugs!\nI've been listening and building features as quick as possible.\n\nMany wanted to combine timer with quote or redirects, now you've got it!\n\nYou can allocate the time you can spend on a site per day. Once the time is up, you will be taken to the quote or the alternative site, and be productive! Don't abuse the timer ;-).\n\nAlso the timer will not continue counting if you've switched to another app with the current site open. \n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNever feel guilty, Time Warp loves you and will never blame you.\n\nLike our facebook page! https://www.facebook.com/timewarpusers\n\nCredit: Thanks http://www.entypo.com/ for the great icons!\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWe've been mentioned by LifeHacker! Yay!\nhttp://lifehacker.com/time-warp-keeps-you-focused-helps-you-avoid-distractin-749201935"
