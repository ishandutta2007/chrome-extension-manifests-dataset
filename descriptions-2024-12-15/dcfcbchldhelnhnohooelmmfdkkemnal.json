This extension works only on shared sites created with Shutterfly. It will not work from your account in Shutterfly.\n\n**** NOTE: If the extension doesn't work for you, send your comments to https://shutterflyextension.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new ****\n\nPlease note, Shutterfly Exporter Chrome Extension is not associated with Shutterfly. It is a free tool that is only made possible by community support, there is no corporation behind it. Hence, if you'd like to see changes to the tool, please support it via one of the following ways\n\nSquare Cash  https://cash.app/app/JNLQDBP \nPayPal https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=barx6_FpUTzjrHQBKLT-AYCIWE-FBnwEVzeHjeKuZMzKtFcqaYqLumd2RnK7byyEuvAYFW&country.x=US&locale.x=US\nBitcoin https://onename.com/katzmopolitan\nCoinbase https://www.coinbase.com/join/katzmopolitan\n\nHere is how it works\n\n -  In your Shutterfly account, create a \"share site\" for the pictures that you want to download. This will create a site like \"mypictures.shutterfly.com\". You can create private site if you want to make sure no one has access to it.\n  - Open the share site url in Chrome\n  - Click on any subfolders with pictures that you have such that you see actually images appear\n  - If the album is available for extraction, you will see an icon in right corder the URL bar\n  - Click the arrow and press “Download my pictures”\n  - If you get a notification about downloading files, click “Allow”\n  - Your images should start downloading shortly. They will be downloaded into the default downloads folder.\n\nIf you get a prompt about saving each individual file, please make sure that you've allowed the extension so save multiple files at a time (see screenshot)\n\nThis extension is not affiliated with Shutterfly.com in anyway. I do not take an responsibility for your usage of the tool.\n\nThis is an open source project.
