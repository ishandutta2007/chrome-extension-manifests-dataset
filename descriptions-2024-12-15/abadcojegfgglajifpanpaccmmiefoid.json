Remembering unique password for each account is impossible. vPass is the solution: you only need to remember master password, and vPass generates unique password for services you use. Read more.\n\n** Secure by default\nvPass generates mix of numbers and letters (by default 12 characters long) which are virtually impossible to brute-force.\n\n** Only takes a couple of key strokes\nvPass is very keyboard-friendly. Open web-page, focus on  a password field, open vPass, enter master password, hit Enter, done!\n\n** Your master password does not leave your device\nThere is  no data transfer between your browser and vPass server. It's 100% client-side. You can even host vPass yourself, for ultimate security.\n\n** Works on any platform with web browser\nWindows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, webOS, and any future OS too.\n\n** Works for any service, not only web\nYou can generate password no just for web service, but for anything that can be referred to  as \"username\". I actually use it  to secure passwords for Linux users such as \"root\", \"www\", etc."
