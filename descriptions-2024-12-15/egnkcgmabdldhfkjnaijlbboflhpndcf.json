We show you the videos that your peers with similar interests have watched recently. \n\nHow it works: \nA group moderator (Reddit, Facebook, etc.) will create a group on the platform to which he will invite his members. The idea is that a group that likes Football will be able to see relevant videos on its topic. The extension records your youtube watch history and creates a new Trending for individual communities. \n\nOur Core Principles:\n1. Free Speech - We do not mess with the ordering of the videos you see, its sorted by view count. No shadow banning, No Code of Conduct. After all, who are we to tell you what you can watch and what you can't.\n2. Data Commerce - We find the idea of bundling up your data and selling it to the highest bidder disgusting and morally bankrupt\n3. Evolution - We strongly believe that the only way to be good is to constantly improve and iterate our software and product. We strongly encourage everyone to leave feedback and ideas. \n\n\nVersion Disclaimer: \nThis is a very early version of the program, please report any bugs, ideas or complaints.\n\nData Disclaimer:\nWe do not store any data aside from the Youtube links you visit. None of your data is attached to your name, it is added to our database anonymously."
