You only have to remember your Single Pass password and Single Pass will generate unique, secure passwords for every other web site you visit. You never have to write down your passwords or risk somebody stealing your passwords with Single Pass.\n\nHow do I Use Single Pass?\n\nFirst, select a complex Single Pass password that only you know. Don't write it down where it can be stolen. Memorize it. This will be your key to everything! If somebody steals your Single Pass password, all of your generated passwords will be compromised!\n\nEnter your Single Pass password and a Service Name. A service name might be something like \"google.com\". You name the services you use in whatever way you want. You can enter \"google\" or \"google.com\" or \"www.google.com\" or \"accounts.google.com\".  What is important is that you follow a consistent approach that you can remember or that you keep a list of service names in a separate file. Without the exact service name, Single Pass cannot generate the same \"service password\". Note that \"Google\" and \"google\" are different service names, since the software is case-sensitive.\n\nWant even stronger security? Use cryptic service names for your services. For example, rather than use \"google.com\", use a password generator to create complex service names. It's OK to write down the cryptic service names in a file or put them on a sticky note, since they are useless without your Single Pass password you keep stored in your head. Using this approach also addresses the issue where some web sites require you to change your password from time-to-time or require special characters or passwords of a specific length.\n\nOnce you enter your Single Pass password and Service Name, click \"Compute\" and Single Pass will compute the 16-character \"Service Password\" for your service.  Use the computed Service Password when visiting a web site.\n\nThat's it! You are no longer forced to memorizing dozens of passwords or write down hundreds of passwords. You only need to memorize one!\n\nNew Features by Version\n1.14 - Modest UI changes for consistency with Firefox\n1.12 - 1.13 - Never published for Chrome\n1.11 - Minor \"look and feel\" changes and updated APIs used to get tab URLs\n1.10 - Revised icon sizes per Google's specifications\n1.9 - Changes required for revisions to Chrome (no feature enhancements)\n1.8 - Copy to the clipboard automatically after generating the password"
