Anyone can add funds to a bug or claim it. You can search for bounties too!\nWhen a developer claims a bounty, the backers get an email with a link to reject the bounty if it was falsely claimed.\nIf no one rejects the bounty, the claimant will receive the bounty in their bank account after a week.\nIf someone rejects the bounty, Havi will facilitate dispute resolution between both parties as efficiently as possible. \n\n\n\nHavi is powered by Stripe, so we don't store any of your payment data directly.\n\nwww.havi.co"
