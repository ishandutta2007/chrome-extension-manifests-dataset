As such, this plugin has no automation and never will have, however it does have a bunch of features you might fancy \n\nThe most important features include but are not limited to:\n* Main action auto focus - just hit enter or space to step / attack / perform quest\n* Chrome notifications (safe mode expired, world boss attackable, job completed)\n* Daily tasks trackers  - see just how many more of which quests you have left to perform\n* Daily and monthly rewards notifications - forget free rewards no more\nMany more small QoL tweaks are waiting for you to be discovered\n\nFull list of features, changelogs and source code can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/SugarF0x/simple-assistant\n\nAll the features are optional and are disabled by default - tailor your own experience"
