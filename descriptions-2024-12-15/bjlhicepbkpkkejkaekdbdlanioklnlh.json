After a few of those, you take a big break. \n\nMain features:\n\n* Three different timers for the different sessions (work/study (time block), small break and big break, all completely customizable.\n\n* The ability to play a \"ding\" sound/open a small popup window when a session ends.\n\n* Keyboard shortcuts to start any of the three given presets, or stop the currently running one.\n\n* A badge on the icon of the add-on indicating the minutes left for the session, so you don't have to open the add-on to know the time left.\n\n* The ability to continue from the Time Block session to the Small Break session.\n\nSource: github.com/igorkheifetz/timeblocker"
