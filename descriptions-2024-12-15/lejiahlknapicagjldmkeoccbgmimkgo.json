The screenshot sharing platform helps to check and track the availability of US visa appointments. The platform supports many US visa types like Student Visa (F-1),  Employment Visa (H-1B), Tourism & Business Visa (B1, B2, B1/B2).\n\nDetailed Story:\nChecking US visa slot availability has been a hurdle to millions of visa applicants every year for multiple reasons\n1. Lack of slots availability\n2. Locking out for 72 hours if the portal *thinks* the user is a bot\n3. Do not show the availability of the slots for 24 hours after 3-5 checks or refreshes\n\nTo overcome all these hurdles and prevent being locked out by the visa portal just when needed the most, we, checkvisaslots.com with the help of fellow community members, who check for the visa availability slots, created this tool to share the availability of the slots when they log on to the US Visa appointment scheduling portal.\n\nImproved UX:\n1. Automatically navigates to the earliest slot date\n2. Keeps you ready to submit for an earliest time slot - you'll be one-click away to get a slot\n2. Show an overview of all available slots"
