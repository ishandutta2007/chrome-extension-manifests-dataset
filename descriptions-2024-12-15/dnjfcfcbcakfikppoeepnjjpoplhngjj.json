Learners will engage with time-conscious video content and hands-on challenges in order to earn badges for mastery.\n\nOnce in a micro-course, learners will be able to access professional learning content and begin the related challenge.  Once the challenge window opens, the box will conveniently follow the user in Google Chrome as he/she completes the challenge.  Learners have an at-a-glance view of their in-progress courses in order to quickly continue learning where they left off.  Once a learner submits a response to a challenge, his/her challenge task will be evaluated by certified educators, who will provide feedback and award badges along the way as learners master various skills.\n\nWhether the goal is to learn the basics of G Suite apps like Docs and Classroom, harness the power of more advanced Google tools, or earn Google certifications, MobileMind’s G Suite Cloud PD can help you achieve your Google learning goals!"
