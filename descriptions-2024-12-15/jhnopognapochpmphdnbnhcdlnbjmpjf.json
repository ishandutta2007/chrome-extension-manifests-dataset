The race can not take place, because the car lost one wheel. He is completely helpless, standing at the start without moving. Your task is to find and roll a wheel for him. It turns out that it is a car component of the car, without which it will move. The wheel will have to overcome many obstacles to get to the native car. Help him jump over empty gaps, turn up boxes to climb onto high platforms and collect coins."
