Introducing SurfGPT – a groundbreaking Chrome extension that brings the ChatGPT magic to every webpage. 🌐\n\nSurfGPT's Unmatched Features:\n- 🧑‍🔧 Prompts designed by a Conversational AI Engineer for all types of summarizations (Tutorials, Threads, Articles).\n- 🚀 Contextual Q&A assistance on any webpage!\n- 🔑 Enter your own API key for unlimited usage (no caps!)\n- ⚙️ Breaks down articles into parts to avoid token limits.\n\nPerfect For:\n- 🌪️ Intuitively summarizing articles, tutorials, and conversations in a flash.\n- 🤔 Asking contextual questions within any webpage.\n- 💬 Getting response suggestions for threads.\n- ⚡️ Revving up your research sessions.\n\nFor the curious:\n🤔 Why not GPT-4?\nSurfGPT was original designed with GPT-4, but while testing itself it was clear that the cost-benefit didn't make sense. It was 15 times more expensive, leading to about 10 cents spent per page on average. So I spent extra effort designing the prompts to get almost similar results with ChatGPT.\n\n🤔 How does it work?\nSurfGPT scrapes the content of your current webpage and passes it along with your queries to generate contextual answers for you!\n\n🤯 Got any fun facts?\n90% of SurfGPT was built using ChatGPT itself!\n\n🔮 What does the future hold?\nThere's many exciting things planned for the roadmap (eg. Multilingual support and Multimedia analysis, including research papers, presentations, excel, audio and video) which will be published for everyone to view AND have a say in!"
