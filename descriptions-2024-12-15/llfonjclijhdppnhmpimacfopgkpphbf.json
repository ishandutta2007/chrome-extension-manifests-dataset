Designed to make the web that little be easier to navigate by making your browser history truly work for you.\n\nSavedPages is a handy tool for those researching for a project, whether that is a school project, holiday planning, window shopping, work project or any type of investigation, SavedPages makes it easy to record your journey (both automatically or manually), snipping relevant content along the way for later referral. You can even share your journey with those that do not have SavedPages installed.\n\nSavedPages fills in that gap left between the bookmarks and your browser history.\n\nThe following features are available:\n\n* Automatic recording of visit history to a collection\n* Manage multiple collections\n* Manual adding of a page to a collection\n* Snip a block of text on a page to a collection\n* Share a collection with others who do not have the browser extension installed\n* Manually add a note to a page in a collection\n\n:: Inspiration __________________________________\n\nLike all good projects, SavedPages came from a need to easily document a given browser session as a single unit. Manually bookmarking each page, is laborous and very error prone (you forget to bookmark that one crucial page that you can't find later on!). Looking through your browser history is not logical, as it is full of a lot of noise from unrelated pages.\n\nWhat was required, was to not only auto-store (or tag through the right-hand menu) pages, but to be able to snip small pieces of content from the page and record that with the collection.\n\nSo after much searching around, no solution presented itself, so instead of waiting, SavedPages was born.\n\n:: Release History ______________________________\n\n* 2018.12.24\n** Initial release; with all basic features"
