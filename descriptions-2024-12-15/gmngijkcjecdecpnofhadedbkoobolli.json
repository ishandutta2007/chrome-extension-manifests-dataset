For example, if you visit\ngroups.google.com/a/example.com/forum/, Groups may use the last domain account you were using, instead of your @example.com account. This can prevent you from seeing your organization's forums, and the switcher in the Groups UI is hidden behind a link and often redirects you away from the forum you were trying to visit.\n\nGroups Account Picker solves this by adding the \"?authuser=N\" query string to the Groups URL, where N is the account number you want to use for that group. This allows you to specify to Groups which account of yours to use.\n\nThe current version defaults to two domain accounts, @chromium.org and @google.com, so it will only work for users with accounts in both of those domains (i.e., Chromium developers)."
