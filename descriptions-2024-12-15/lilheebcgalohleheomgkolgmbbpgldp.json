Wherever you read an article, just hit the key to scroll. Then it will scroll down properly eliminating any interruption of your reading pace and article's context.\n\nMotivation : Basically, every time I read an article on website, there were some methods to scroll down. Spacebar or PageDown key scrolled too much amount at one use. And on the other hand, DownArrow key or Mouse Wheel took me  too many pressing or wheeling. Both of these methods made me frustrated.\n\nFunction : By pressing the RightArrow key, you can scroll down a half of your web screen smoothly. The assigned key, amount of scrolling, and scrolling velocity can be adjusted at preference menu."
