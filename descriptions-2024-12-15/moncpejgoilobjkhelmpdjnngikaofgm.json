We are not mindful of our data consumption, whilst making small adjustments could save huge amounts of carbon emissions. For instance, if every adult in the UK sent one less ‘thank you’ email, it could save 16,433 tonnes of carbon a year - the equivalent of taking 3,334 diesel cars off the road [1].\n\nThis browser extension helps you to lower your online carbon footprints. By providing data insights on your carbon emissions, giving pop-up advice and comparing your emissions to that of others. \n\nThis extension is a research prototype of a final master project at Eindhoven University of Technology. By downloading this extension, you are contributing to research on online carbon footprints. By collecting anonymous usage data and asking you to fill in short surveys, we are studying how we can guide internet users to lower their online carbon footprints.\n\nPlease contact p.m.c.fransen@student.tue.nl in case of questions or comments. \n\n\n\n[1] Griffiths, S.
