Everything found here is completely adherent to, and modeled after, the WAI's WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), which can be found here: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/\n\nBelow is a list of current standard issues which are improved upon, or fixed, by the extension, along with their corresponding WCAG guideline.\n\n[1.1.1] IMAGE CAPTIONING: OpenMonarch implements a CLIP- (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) based machine learning algorithm to caption images so that they may be read by screen readers and thus accessed by blind or visually impaired individuals. This function can be accessed by selecting an image and pressing Ctrl + M, or hovering over an image and pressing Ctrl + , (Comma)\n\nOpenMonarch, and the initiative it is a part of, are completely open source. The code can be found at https://github.com/MiloAkerman/Monarch.\n\nThe extension is currently in active development and maintenance by Milo Akerman (Student at School for Advanced Studies - Wolfson)"
