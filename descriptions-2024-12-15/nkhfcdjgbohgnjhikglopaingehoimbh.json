Instead, many developers are properly securing their plugins and others get them properly secured when alerted they havenâ€™t done that, while other plugin developers either are unable or unwilling to properly secure their plugins. With the latter group, among the issues we have seen, are developers who have introduced new serious vulnerabilities that are substantially similar to vulnerabilities that they know have been exploited in their plugins.\n\nIn situations where we become aware of developers who have shown that inability or unwillingness to properly secure their plugin, we are releasing advisories to warn customers of our service and the wider WordPress community of the risk of utilizing those developers' plugins. This extension adds a notice on the pages of the WordPress Plugin Directory for the plugins from those developers."
