It can be often tedious and time consuming to fact check all such claims. CheckFact✔ attempts to help with that problem through the use of Snopes. \n\nSnopes, formerly known as the Urban Legends Reference Pages, is a fact-checking website which has been described as a \"well-regarded reference for sorting out myths and rumors\" on the Internet. It has also been seen as a source for validating and debunking urban legends and similar stories in American popular culture.\n\nCheckFact✔ can be used to look up a dodgy internet claim with three easy steps:\n1. Use mouse to select dodgy internet claim\n2. Right click on highlighted text and click on \"Search Snopes for...\"\n3. Check validity of said claim on redirected Snopes page\n\nCheckFact✔ takes your highlighted text or keywords and opens a new tab, searching for validity the highlighted claim on Snopes.\n\nContrarily, You can click on the CheckFact✔ popup in the top right and enter a phrase/keywords into the text-box and search for it in Snopes!\n\nDisclaimer: CheckFact✔ and the author are not affiliated with Snopes in any way, shape or form.\n\nP.S.: Here's the github link with the source-code if you would like to check it out and create something of your own: https://github.com/anmolshres/chrome-extension-snopes\nLink to Snopes: https://www.snopes.com/"
