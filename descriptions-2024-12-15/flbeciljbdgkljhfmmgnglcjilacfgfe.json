It adds configurable keyboard shortcuts that help perform repetitive tasks faster. It especially gives you an edge in player vs. player combat.\n\nThis extension is approved by the Pardus developers.\n\nRecent news:\n\nJuly 11, 2024: Version 45 released. Fixes some remaining issues with keyboard focus on Windows, and fixes the Set Waypoint action.\nJuly 9, 2024: Version 44 released after seven years of dormancy. This is a redesign to conform to Chrome's \"manifest V3\" requirement, in time to survive deprecation of V2. Here's to seven more years of uneventful service!\n\nA note about SGPvP TE:\n\nAt some point in those seven years, due to my disinterest in working on this extension, other developers forked the code and published their own improved versions, for which I'm very grateful. Of note is Tsunder's popular Trader Edition, with additional non-combat commands, as well as \"autopilot\" navigation which is quite magical.\n\nAll features of SGPvP TE have now been merged into this versionâ€”let's call it \"plain\" or \"original\" SGPvP.\n\nAs a user, you should uninstall SGPvP TE and install plain SGPvP from one of the links above, at least for the time being. This is because plain SGPvP actually works on current Chrome, after the phase-out of manifest V2, and it includes all the functionality from SGPvP TE.\n\nIf/when SGPvP TE pulls this code again as a base for future improvements, you will be able to use either version, at your option. I will try to keep this one up to date, promise.\n\nWhen you switch from plain to TE, and vice versa, you will have to export and import your keymap, and configure again your QL and armour settings. Sorry about that. You actually can have both installed at the same time but, it goes without saying, one of them should be disabled at all times."
