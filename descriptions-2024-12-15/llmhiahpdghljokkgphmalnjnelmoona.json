Your brain can read faster than your eyes, so by essentially reducing the number of letters your eye needs to look at, you can read faster while still retaining the full context.\n\nThis Extension does just that, by transforming whatever text you're reading into bionic format. You can adjust the font weight, font size, and the colour of the word that are highlighted as well!"
