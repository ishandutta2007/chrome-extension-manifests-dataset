Simply click on the extension's icon, toggle into removal mode, and select all the content that annoys you. Wanna get things back and remove your changes? There's also a button ready for that.\n\nIt does not work on any type of content -- specially one that is being generated through time -- but does do the job on a lot of them.\n\nGood part of the deal: All your changes are there after you refresh the page.\n\nIt's also totally free and open source: https://github.com/Amtrix/chrome-page-purifier"
