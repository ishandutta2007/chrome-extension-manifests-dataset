The reader is designed and stylized for the most optimal readability — from fonts and colors to spacing and sizing.\n\nWhen you activate the \"Let Me Read\" action by clicking the icon, this extension will grab all the important text from the current webpage and place it nicely into a reader that completely replaces the open webpage. All that's left is the text to read! \nThat means no ads, popups, images, videos, media, forms, scripts, or extra content of any kind. Nothing but text — nothing but reading. \n\nLess is more."
