Just Download and use Netflix like normal, no setup necessary! \nThis is a side project of mine I made for fun. I have many plans to expand on its current offerings and soon the extension will:\n-Display rating on top of thumbnails, so there'll be no need to click to see the rating\n-Display ratings from multiple aggregators, such as MetaCritic and RottenTomatoes\n-Customizable display options\n-And many more!\nI hope anyone who decides to download enjoys it, and please let me know if you have any issues with it, as I look forward to improving the extension.\n\n\nNote: \n-Poor internet connection may result in delays in the appearance of the ratings, but they will show up. Some ratings will show up as \"N/A\" as the database used to source the ratings doesn't always contain the latest films (I only noticed this occurring on films that came out in 2020). \n-RARELY an issue occurs that I haven't resolved yet, and you'll see \"Rare_Issue\" displayed as the rating. I have only seen this on one show (namely, \"Nadiya's Time to eat\") but if you do see that on any others please feel free to let me know."
