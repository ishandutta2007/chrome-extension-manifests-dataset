Or you can't find exactly where you left off. YouTube's built-in history feature... leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe YouTube Easy Resume extension provides an easy-to-access watch history list through a simple interface. Once you install the extension,  **pin it in your toolbar** and you'll be able to open a dropdown to see YouTube videos you didn't finish, jump right back to where you were watching, and access the content you want. When you resume a video it will start playing right where you left off.\n\nYou can also tweak the settings to change what videos show up in the extension. Do you want it to only include videos that are longer than 5 minutes? Or to only list videos you've watched for more than two minutes? Easy peasy.\n\nAll your video history is stored locally, no one else has access to what you watch. Besides, we would never judge you for watching four-hour-long action figure unboxing videos. You do you.\n\nThis extension was made by the web team in the Annenberg Media newsroom to make watching YouTube a better experience. It's a labor of love, something we wanted to use ourselves, and wanted to share with the world.\nDigital Development Lead: Gautam Rajan\nGraphics: B\nDigital production supervisor: Graham Clark"
