Rather than spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on a new rig, I can show you how to wring out the best sonic quality from what you already own in my step-by-step guide, Total Guitar Setup.\n \nUncle Randy here.  Since the mid-sixties, I've been playing guitar and bass professionally.  Because I could never afford a guitar tech to establish and maintain my treasured instruments, I was forced to learn the secrets of keeping my guitars in top playing condition, regardless of temperature, humidity or location.  You know what I'm talking about — those emergency situations on the road."
