Depending on your state, the stated transaction is a rental-purchase deal (rent-to-own agreement, consumer rental-purchase agreement, or lease/lease-purchase agreement) with Katapult. It is not necessary to be an owner. You will not own the goods until you have paid in full the whole amount required to obtain ownership or you exercise your early purchase option. Payment amounts and rental terms may be found in your lease agreement.\n \nThe phrase \"No Credit Option\" indicates that this is not a credit, loan, or financing transaction. It does not indicate or suggest that no check into credit history or creditworthiness will be undertaken. We examine your application using numerous data points and routinely accept clients with less-than-perfect credit."
