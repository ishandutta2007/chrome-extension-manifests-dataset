None of the feed data is stored or transmitted elsewhere, it is merely passed on Chrome's XML preview mode.\n\nNew in version 1.2:\n- Adds a permalink icon that provides a bookmarkable URL for viewing the current feed.\n\nNew in version 1.1:\n- Displays the feed URL (and allows it to be modified)\n- Re-fetches the feed from the server when the page is reloaded"
