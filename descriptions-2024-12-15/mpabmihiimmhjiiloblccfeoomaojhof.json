The biggest tech companies have perverse incentives to spy on their users, even without the U.S. government demanding that they add encryption backdoors. By using Memespeech, you are not only concealing your communications in a way that none of them can intercept, you are making a powerful statement: our privacy sHalL NoT Be iNFrINGeD!"
