All code originally written by Crayne. All features can be turned on or off at will, though a page reload will be required for any changes to take effect.\n\nFeatures include:\nDeadlinks: shows at the top of main series if any links are currently pointing to nonexistent pages.\nHIRTOY? or 'Have I Read This One Yet': shows checkmarks on SCP articles marked as read.\nPrev/Next: buttons on every main series article.\nRemove Rating: prevents the display of the the page votes bar at the top, and removes the number of votes displayed at the bottom of a page.\nReal Votes: shows a new link under the page votes bar that displays in-depth rating info.\nAuthor Karma: change forum karma bar to being based off of the number of articles the author has written.\nStaff IDs: ever think that there are too many staff to keep track of? Now staff positions can be displayed under forum usernames.\nPM Links: Displays a little button next to usernames that quick-links to sending a PM to that user.\nJumpbox: Displays a box at the very top of the page that allows one to leap straight to any scp article, or any other article on the site. Spaces are automatically replaced with dashes.\n\nGithub:\nhttps://github.com/CraftSpider/SCPWikiTools\n\nLicense:\nThe SCP Wiki, and all derivative works, are licensed under the CC-BY-SA, version 3.0. Thus, all artwork and usage of \"SCP Foundation\" and similar are covered under that license. The code separate from the foundation is unlicensed, however if derived without inclusion of the CC license, all media relevant to the foundation cannot be included."
