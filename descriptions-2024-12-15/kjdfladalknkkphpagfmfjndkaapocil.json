Finally, all fetched orders can be downloaded as one consolidated file.\n\nThe export file is in pipe-delimited format with these fields: Order ID, Order Date, Item name, Price.\n\nLimitations\n- Digital order items (e.g. e-book) are not supported currently.\n- The display language on Amazon Japan must be in Japanese.\n- After downloading orders on a page, please double-check the \"Fetched orders\" count. A full page should normally have 10 orders, so it should be fairly obvious if something is missed. (While the extension is tested to be working as of the release date, Amazon Japan occasionally changes its page layout in subtle ways, which would cause this extension to break. A fix is necessary in such case.) \n\nRelease Notes\n1.1\n- Fixed issue where some orders were missed and some had errors due to failing to find the order date, It appears there were some changes to Amazon Japan's page layout recently."
