It's a win-win situation. The ads are skipped very fast, but you might see a tiny glimpse of them upon loading videos on certain occasions.\n\nNOTES\n- If ads aren't being blocked properly, just tell us by clicking \"Click here\" in the extension. We'll fix it right ahead!\n- You might need to disable your other AdBlockers (e.g. AdBlock Pro, uBlock etc.) because they often detected and thereby hinder this one from working properly!\n- It doesn't block popups. We propose that you use a designated chrome popup-blocker for that."
