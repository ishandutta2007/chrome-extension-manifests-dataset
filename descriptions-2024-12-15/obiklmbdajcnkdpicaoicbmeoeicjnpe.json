It is a platform that creates and provides opportunities for upcoming artists. \n\nThe platform is also a collection of innovative people who intend to create a society that is inspired and informed in order facilitate active participation of marginalised groups within communities. \n\nNam Radio also acts as a movement that gives power to upcoming artists. In addition, it gives artists who do not have access to the media airtime and is designed to reduce inequality for emerging artists within the entertainment industry."
