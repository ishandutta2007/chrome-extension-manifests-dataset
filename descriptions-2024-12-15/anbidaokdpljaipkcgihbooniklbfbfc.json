This all happens in the background; so whenever you come across a word that is in your deck, txtReplace will automatically replace it. Think of these decks as a bunch of flashcards where one side is the word you want to find and the other side is the replacement.\n\nThe simple concept of this extension allows for it to be applied to a wide variety of scenarios:\n\n• PASSIVE LEARNING: Replace certain words with its foreign language counterpart to aid in improving your vocabulary in that language.\n\n• ENHANCED BROWSING: Display its capital city whenever a country's name is displayed to get an enhanced browsing experience.\n\n• FILTERING CONTENT: Sanitize explicit content to get a more kid-friendly browsing experience.\n\n• Anything else you can think of!"
