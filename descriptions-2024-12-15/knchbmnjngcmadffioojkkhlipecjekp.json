You can look at the screenshot to see how pigs are displayed.\n\nThis extensions needs host_permissions \"*://*/*\" (it means \"every website\") to include a CSS and JS script that will display the \"snow pig\". This extensions does not need any other permission.\n\nThe \"snow pig\" is rendered in full CSS, we use JS only to inject html emojies in the current web page, and then animate them with CSS (thanks to https://github.com/Artimon/pure-css-snowfall).\n\nIf you have any concern or question about the extension, please leave a comment, we'll be happy to answer."
