It is also configurable (click on the configure icon on the top right) so that you can specify and use any OAuth 2.0 endpoints as long as they implement OAuth 2.0 draft 10 and above.\n\nThe OAuth 2.0 playground is integrated with Google Drive. You can simulate the open-with flow of a Drive file with the OAuth 2.0 playground, and then finish the OAuth 2.0 flow with the playground and play HTTP requests to the Drive REST API.\n\n---\n\nOAuth 2.0 is an open protocol for authorization and authentication that is currently being drafted. Please see http://oauth.net/2/ for more details.\n\nThe OAuth and OAuth 2.0 logos used in the promotional images and as logos are the work of Chris Messina and are used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 license.
