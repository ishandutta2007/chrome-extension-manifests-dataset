The extension can optionally show the real estimated duration of each lecture and section through the extension's settings.\n\nThe extension underwent a massive update in order to make it more functional. If you detect any issues with it please let us know in the email indicated at the Extension Details section below, so that we can address it.\n\nNote: This extension doesn't work at the moment with Udemy for business,  it only supports regular Udemy."
