So you can easily harvest them when searching at Google. Quite simple. :-)\n\nIt helps you to do brief keyword analysis for SEO and to find new similar keywords. \n\nTake a look at the screenshots.\n\nMore about \"People also search for\": https://searchengineland.com/google-launches-new-look-people-also-search-search-refinements-291918\n\n\nGoogle uses to change HTML from time to time, so the extension might stop working. In this case, please, contact me at Twitter - @Neologyc, or at email - jaroslav at hlavinka.cz. It would help me a lot to keep extension working.
