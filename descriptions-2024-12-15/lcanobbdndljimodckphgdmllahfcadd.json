It focuses on one thing only - displaying your ES index data and does it better than existing browsers, which are either built with a legacy UI or leave much to desire in their Ux.\n\ndejavu uses 100% browser javascript and is written with React v0.14.7. In addition to this chrome extension, it's also available as an Elasticsearch plugin and as a hosted website at https://appbaseio.github.io/dejaVu.\n\nYou can read about how it compares to existing solutions here - https://github.com/appbaseio/dejaVu#comparison-with-other-data-browsers."
