Thus, it contains every page of text that ever has been and ever could be written in many of the world's languages, and potential translations or transliterations of all the others. \n\nThe External Resource Locator can find the text of any website you visit within the library of babel. It provides a more immediate experience of the library's omniferousness. After installation, an image of three nested hexagons will appear to the right of your browser's navigation bar. It can be used in the following ways:\n\n1) Navigate to any web page and click the button to find all of the text from that page in the library. Note that this will include all the anchor text from links and navigation elements as well as any more relevant text - the library is indifferent to sense.\n\n2) Highlight any text from the page then click the button to locate only the highlighted text within the library.\n\nor\n\n2b) Highlight text then right-click the selection and choose \"Look for selected text in the Library of Babel\"\n\nAll is foretold..."
