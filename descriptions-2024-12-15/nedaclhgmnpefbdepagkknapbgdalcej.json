Search Podchaser.com for the person you're preparing to speak or meet with. Use whatever notes app you want to store your research. \n\n---\n\nDo you research your upcoming guests and/or topics to prepare your podcast? \nDo you research people before meetings or sales calls? \n\nIf you're an outlier, you do. \n\nAs you search the Web for the person you're preparing to interview or meet with, you highlight a piece of content you want to save, activate the OutlierClips extension: clip full articles, bios, facts, notes, quotes, or any other text you come across online. \n\nOutlierClips captures several bits of data with each clip: the text you highlighted, the page link where you clipped the content, the name you've given the clip, and any custom notes you've added about the clipped content. With complete privacy — no account needed. \n\nJust keep clipping as you research. Spend 10 minutes, or an hour, or whatever amount of time researching your person or topic. OutlierClips adds each clip to your virtual clipboard (privately, securely), creating a clean, running log of organized, text-based content. \n\nYou can even highlight a person's first and last name, activate the extension, and perform a quick search on Podchaser.com to see if the person has said anything profound on recent podcast episodes. (Coming soon, you'll be able to quickly search LinkedIn as well.) \n\n---\n\nAfter your last clip, when your research session is done and you're ready to start reviewing all of your clips, you click the \"Copy All\" button in the OutlierClips sidebar, then paste all of your clips into the app of your choice — anywhere you store your notes and outlines for episodes. \n\nNo matter how many clips you captured. One or 1,000. \n\nIf you're using Google Sheets or Airtable or some other database to paste your content in a more structured way, OutlierClips can take things one step further: You can tap the \"Download CSV\" button at the bottom of the overlay after clipping your last item of research and the .csv file will download to your computer. You can then import all of your clips at once. \n\nFaster research, encouraging you to prepare better for interviews, calls, meetings, or any upcoming event."
