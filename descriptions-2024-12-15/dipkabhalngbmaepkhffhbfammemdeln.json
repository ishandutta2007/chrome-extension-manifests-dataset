You can toggle this setting in the Options page for the Light theme.\n\n  To Top: This button floats at the bottom right of the page for easy back to top scrolling feature.\n\nBasic Subscription:\n\n  CraigsCookies: This feature clears all CL cookies when you click the cookie icon. You can access this feature from within the search page by clicking the tools icon on the far right within our main Preview toolbar. The app toolbar will become unhidden, and based upon your subscription, you will find controls and links to various apps there including this one.\n\n  Unbanish: When you flag an ad on CL,  the site will auto hide it. This app removes that behavior and replaces their hide feature with our hide / unhide feature which allows you to easily hide and manage any ad you like with the controls embedded into any search page. You can even hide or unhide all of the ads at once and easily manage and restore the hidden ones.\n\n  CraigsEnforcer: This app allows you to create an auto preview cycle of any group of CL ads that you have not set to hidden with the Unbanish app. You can preview all your unhidden ads with the click of a single button and preview the entire list that comes up when you search your keywords or section. There are 3 cycles for preview, 1x 4x or infinite. Fresh ads will be added to the rotation as they are posted. This technique makes your ads resistant to Craigslist flagging. The more your ads are viewed, the more flags that are required to remove them.\n\nPro Subscription:\n\n  CraigsPoster: This app allows you to save ads to its database so you can inject them quickly into new posts with two simple clicks and dramatically decrease the amount of time it takes for you to write new ads each time you post.\n\n  CraigsFlagger: This app also allows you to create an auto preview cycle of any searched group of ads that you have not hidden. With the click of a button, preview the entire list of ads that comes up when you do any CL search. There are 3 types of preview cycles, 1, 4, or infinite. New ads will be added as they are posted. With this feature the application marks each unhidden ad as spam and cycles through them based upon the cycle settings.\n\n  CraigsAccounts: Our handy Account management app works on the CL accounts page. It clears all past cookies for the site every time you load the Cl account page. This protects your privacy and prevents CL from tracking your movements from one account to another. You can add as many sets of credentials with the controls embedded into the top of the accounts page, and recall these credentials from a simple dropdown which populates the login box automatically. You can import and export all of your CL accounts credentials easily, and never lose your credentials from an account again.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nOur CraigsAccounts feature is a failsafe CL cookie manager. It prevents CL from using tracking cookies to spy on your login sessions. It is important to note, one does not simply turn off cookies from your browser, or wipe them all as you use it with a 3rd party application. You need to have the correct cookies in place as they expect to find them or your CL experience will be severely diminished.\n\nTo subscribe for Basic or Pro features, you can visit the subscriptions link within the Craigslist Ad Preview options page.\n\nMembership:\n\nOur Ghostbusters Members CL tutorial and video area is included free with your Basic or Pro subscription. To access this area login to your account, and hover over the Members link in the top navigation bar to access tutorials and the members video library. We teach you about the posting and the flagging systems, and how to avoid the spambot and the flaggers while using CL.\n\nYou will find links to the full set of instructions by clicking the icon in the browser toolbar. You can also hover over each embedded control within the CL page for a short description of its function.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our extension, and leave us a review to tell us what you think or suggest new features we can add.\n\nChange Log:\n\n08/24/2019 0.0.1.0 -  beta release!\n\n08/25/2019 0.0.1.1 -  small bug fix in css\n\n08/23/2019 0.0.1.2 -  added CraigsCookies app, and chrome notifications for specific features\n\n08/22/2019 0.0.1.3 -  added floating back to top button for easy scroll back to top\n\n08/19/2019 0.0.1.4 -  added titles for each of our embedded controls\n\n08/17/2019 0.0.1.5 -  fixed accounts dropdown not populating\n                      added dark / light theme support\n\n09/20/2019 0.0.1.6 -  fixed toolbar images, added CraigsPoster feature\n\n09/21/2019 0.0.1.7 -  fixed spam / refresh bug\n\n06/06/2020 0.0.1.8 -  fixed glitch in the error response code"
