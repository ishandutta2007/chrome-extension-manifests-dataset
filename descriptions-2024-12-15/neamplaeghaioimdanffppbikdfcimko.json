Theyâ€™re inspired by something or someone. That's why insply is here to help marketers get inspired in their day-to-day work when working on LinkedIn.\n\nWhy Insply?\nLinkedIn is one of the biggest advertising channels out there, especially in B2B. But to view, keep track of and get inspired by what other great companies are doing is almost impossible. We are here to change that.\n\nHow it works\n1. View paid ads on LinkedIn automatically\n2. Save companies as favorite to follow them continuously\n3. Get notifications and be the first one to know when they release anything new\n4. Save the best ads into your very own library of inspirational ads\n5. Share these ads with your colleagues and get started on your new campaign.\n\nNote. This is still in beta and you will encounter bugs and things that are not working perfectly along the way. Please report any feedback, ideas or input you might have on https://www.insply.io/faq."
