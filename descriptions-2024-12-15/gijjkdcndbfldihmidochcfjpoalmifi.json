Audio messaging is quickly becoming the favored medium for communication. Facebook released their voice message feature back in 2013. Since then, WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn and even Apple iMessage have adopted similar functionality.\n\nBut the question we’ve all been asking is, when will Gmail or Outlook 365 release their voice message feature?\n\nWell, if you're tired of waiting, you're going to love Rapid Reply. \n\nStart replying with audio messaging in just three simple steps.\n\n1.\tClick the microphone button\n2.\tRecord your short or in-depth personal audio reply, or new message\n3.\tAttach your recordings directly within Gmail\n\nFeatures Include:\n•\tAn elegant microphone button, moveable to your preferred location\n•\tA quick select microphone menu\n•\tRecordings without time limits\n\n“I answered 85 emails in just 6 hours, while providing a much more personal and detailed response. This same level of activity would have taken me days if I had responded with text. I love this extension.” - Matthew Pollard, author of the bestselling Introvert’s Edge book series"
