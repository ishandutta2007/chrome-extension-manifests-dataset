You can tell TDX Updater is updating your tickets when there is a green border around the box.\n\nTDX Update intelligently starts updating ticket buckets that look like they might be more volatile, but you can modify the TDX Updater settings to update different ticket buckets by clicking the TDX Update bubble in the top right corner of the screen. Here you can change which buckets to update, set alerts when new tickets come in, view announcements, and more.\n\nWhy use TDX Updater?\nThis tool improves consultant response time and productivity with its nearly real-time updates as well as its alert feature that inform consultants when a new ticket comes in. It is advantageous over browser extensions that reload the entire page because it loads new tickets faster and doesn't cause your whole screen to refresh.\n\nFeatures\n- Auto-update buckets: Improved productivity due to quicker responses.\n- Control which buckets to update: Don't waste resources updating buckets that don't change much.\n- Remembers what to update: Each time you navigate to a TDX site, TDX Updater automatically will update the buckets specified according to the user's prior preferences.\n- Alert system: Be notified as soon as a ticket comes in so that you are immediately ready to respond.\n- Different alerts: Choose between visual, auditory, and tab alerts to allow for a notification that is unintrusive while distinctly alerting you that there are clients requesting assistance.\n- Change update interval: Be ready to respond to tickets quickly without overloading the server."
