This extension will hide them so you can browse the web in peace.  GDPR or CCPA?  Ban those banners!\n\nIt also hides other annoying notification banners, such as full-page email signup windows that popup on top of the page content.  Super annoying!\n\nIf you use an ad-blocker, this extension will even hide many of those annoying \"Please disable your adblocker on our page\" notifications that hide the content.\n\nAfter installing Remove Cookie Banners, you'll finally have a peaceful web browsing experience where you can focus on the content, not annoying and useless notifications covering the content you're trying to read.\n\nThe extension can easily be disabled on a per-site basis in case anything goes wrong (and the setting will be remembered in future visits).  Temporarily disabling it will also let you see what obnoxious notifications were hidden by the extension... no reload necessary.\n\nJust click \"Add to Chrome,\" then visit your favorite website and notice how clean and peaceful the web is again!\n\n\nNOTE:\n* Google Chrome may show you a notice about this extension being able to access website data. This is automatically generated because Remove Cookie Banners analyzes the HTML source to intelligently hide notification banners. It does not monitor or save your browsing history or personal information.\n* You may also see a warning that this extension can see your browsing history.  This is because the extension needs to access all your open tabs when you update the extension so changes take effect immediately.  This extension does not save, monitor or use your browsing history."
