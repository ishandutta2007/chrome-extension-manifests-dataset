If you use CTRL + K or COMMAND + K on special pages it won't work!\n\n**Note:** Chrome has some warning messages about the permissions required to run Tab-Master. In fact, Tab-Master's Javascript needs to be loaded on each page. please do not worry. Tab-Master never communicates with the server and does nothing to the data. Everyone is free to read the open source if interested.\n\nWhat does Tab Master include?\n\n1. User-friendly modal which can be opened with `CMD`|`CTRL` + K (depending on what OS you are using) and close by pressing ESCAPE.\n2. Fuzzy search for filtering your opened tabs and history, finding the best result.\n3. Fully customizable features by using the popup or configuration page, where you can: \n  - Turn off/on the extension itself\n  - Turn off/on the history/recent tabs search and only use Tab Master for tab switching\n  - Turn off/on the opened tabs that you can switch to and only use Tab Master for history search\n  - Customize the history search (from and to date), as well as maximum results, shown in the modal.\n  - Toggle between minimal and standard view for each tab/item\n4. Expanding/Collapsing tabs so you can see the full info about the title and URL of the site\n\nCommands\n\nWindows/Linux:\n- Toggle modal - CTRL + SHIFT + K\n  * Should be the preferred way for opening/closing modal:\n  *. If the content script is not loaded (e.g. your internet connection is slow, \n      you’re on pages that do not allow content script like a new page or chrome \n      page), with this command and a new temporary modal will be open in a \n      new tab replacing the not yet loaded modal in the main page\n    * It’s smoother overall since it’s native keybinding and not an event listener\n- Toggle modal (native keybinding is overridden which in some site it might cause a weird behaviour) - CTRL + K\n- Close modal - ESCAPE\n- Next Item/Tab - ArrowDown | ↓\n- Previous Item/Tab - ArrowUp | ↑\n- Close Item/Tab - CONTROL + X\n- Expand Item - SHIFT + ArrowRight | →\n- Collapse Item SHIFT + Arrow Left | ←\n- Toggle Expand/Collapse for Item/Tab - TAB\n- Navigate to selected tab - ENTER | LeftMouseClick\n\nMac:\n- Toggle modal - COMMAND + SHIFT + K\n  * Should be the preferred way for opening/closing modal:\n  *. If the content script is not loaded (e.g. your internet connection is slow, \n      you’re on pages that do not allow content script like a new page or chrome \n      page), with this command and a new temporary modal will be open in a \n      new tab replacing the not yet loaded modal in the main page\n- Toggle modal (2) - CONTROL + K\n- Toggle modal (3) - CMD + K\n- Close modal - ESCAPE\n- Next Item/Tab - ArrowDown | ↓\n- Previous Item/Tab - ArrowUp | ↑\n- Close Item/Tab - CMD + X\n- Expand Item - SHIFT + ArrowRight | →\n- Collapse Item SHIFT + Arrow Left | ←\n- Toggle Expand/Collapse for Item/Tab - TAB\n- Navigate to selected tab - ENTER | LeftMouseClick\n\nThis project is not sponsored by anyone so we would gladly appreciate it if you help us develop this extension even further by clicking on: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/blagoj5"
