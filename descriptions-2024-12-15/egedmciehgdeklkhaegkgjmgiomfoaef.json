When you are not signed into your account it prompts you to sign in. That’s it.\n\nReasons to use it:\nNo data is taken from you. \nIt’s fast. One click to open a new spreadsheet.\nIt’s great for teachers. \nI am a teacher and I made this so my young students would not have to fumble around trying to get to different pages to make a new Google Sheet."
