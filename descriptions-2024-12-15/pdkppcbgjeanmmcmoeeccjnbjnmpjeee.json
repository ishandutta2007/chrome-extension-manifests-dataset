You feel like you're not productive but spend two hours on social media websites each day?\nThen this extension is could for you. Stop Autopilot helps you managing your browsing time to reduce the time you spend on unproductive websites. Regain control over your browsing behaviour and focus on the important things.\n\nFeatures:\n- Maintain a blacklist of unproductive websites\n- Detailed statistics about your browsing behaviour\n- Notifications that remind you to focus on working\n- Block sites or redirect to another website\n\nThe Concept of Stop Autopilot\n- Raising Awareness by showing detailed staticistics about the browsing behaviour to identify problematic websites and to find out how much time you actually waste on unproductive things.\n- Increasing Mindfulness with regular notifications to stop your inner autopilot so that you browse more consciously.\n- Replacing Bad Habits with new ones by letting yourself redirect to another website. Replacing bad habits with new ones is much easier than to quit them completely.\n\nThere already exist other time tracking extensions. Why make another one?\nI tested a lot of them but they didn't quite do the job for me. There are various reasons for that:\n- The tracking extensions aren't helpful when trying to reduce the browsing time on unproductive websites. They only show plain statistics and nothing else.\n- The site blocking extensions aren't motivating at all if you want to reduce the browsing time. They block the sites but they don't give any positive feedback whatsoever.\n- No extension combines time tracking and site blocking which actively helps to change the browsing behaviour.\n- Most of the user interfaces are unintuitive and overloaded with functionality. Stop Autopilot is supposed to be simple and easy to set up."
