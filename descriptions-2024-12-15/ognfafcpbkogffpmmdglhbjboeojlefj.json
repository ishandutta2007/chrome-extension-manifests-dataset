It's an easier chat, and it's end-to-end encrypted.\n\nThis works even if they have yet to join Keybase. The quick summary:\n\n  • Everyone with a social network account has a Keybase inbox, *even before they join Keybase*\n  • You don't need to know the recipient's email address or phone number or Keybase username—just a social media username is enough\n  • No one (at Keybase or the social networks) can read your private exchanges\n  • Look for the \"Keybase Chat\" button on profiles around the web\n  • Toggle specific features in the extension options (chrome://extensions/ and click on \"options\")\n\nAt no point in Keybase's protocol does Keybase ever have the keys necessary to read your messages. This is end-to-end encryption, powered by the convenience of public social media usernames.\n\nKeybase is open source, and so is this extension:\n • https://github.com/keybase/client\n\nYou can find the recent changes for the extension in the history of the \"browser\" directory.\n\n\\o/"
