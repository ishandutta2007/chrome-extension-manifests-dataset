WebTime gives you a colored icon in the toolbar to help you keep track of your daily time on those sites.\n\nThe toolbar icon changes slowly from green --> yellow --> orange --> red.  When you're on a listed site, it shows you your total minutes today on your site list.  If you've gone over your alotment, it adds '!'.\n\nI find it useful to know how much time I'm spending 'unproductively'.  I set my list to be domains that I go when I'm bored, e.g. 'cnn.com', 'techcrunch.com', etc.\n\nPRIVACY: WebTime runs only on your computer and never sends any data anywhere. WebTime only knows what URL you have open.\n\nWebTime is free and open source: https://github.com/jdurack/WebTime"
