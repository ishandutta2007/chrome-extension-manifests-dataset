This is required for the extension to work properly. Everything happens locally, the data is not processed remotely or sent/ logged to any remote destinations.\nThe extension takes a screenshot of the reported message and attaches it to the \"Dubai Land Department - Real Estate Violation Complaint\" form. For privacy, the contact list is blurred.\n\n*About*\nBroker Buster is a shield and sword against intrusive real estate brokers. The idea is to provide a constantly updated, free of charge database of real estate brokers involved in telesales. The database is legal, vast and what you do with it is up to you. But we may have a few suggestions!\n\nBroker Buster for Browser extension allows you to easily and automatically use this database to filter unwanted calls and messages on WhatsApp™ and quickly report spam phone calls from real estate brokers to authorities and mobile operators.\n\nWhy? Because we are tired of the flood of unwanted calls/messages from real estate sales agents. Because we are frightened by the amount of data real estate sales agents have on us. Because telesales is illegal. Because we can!"
