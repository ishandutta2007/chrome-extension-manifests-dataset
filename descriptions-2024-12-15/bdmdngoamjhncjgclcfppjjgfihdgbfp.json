There are different summary modes to choose from based on your purpose. Additionally, you can ask questions specific to the selected text.\n\nOur goal as researchers is to read and understand as quickly and thoroughly as possible. This tool aims to help you achieve that. More features are coming, so stay tuned.\n\nPlease note that the extension takes the entire article on the webpage into account, not just what you selected, in order to provide a more contextual summary. \n\nThe icon of this extension is used under the Creative Commons (Attribution 3.0 Unported) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
