It was selected after a 5-year process where 15 competing designs were evaluated. It supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. It will pick the variant by the size of the key you pass in.\n\nQ: Is it safe?\nA: No effective cryptanalysis of AES cipher is known to date, it's officially recommended by many security agencies (including NSA). It's more than enough, it could take billions of years for a Brute Force attack to find a password to decrypt original message.\n\nQ: Do you store the strings or passwords?\nA: No, we don't. Since the encryption happens on client-side, it's safe, it does not send any data to our servers.\n\nImportant note:\nWe do NOT store a copy of the text or secret word. Also vSecure is using client-side encryption (Browser encryption). You even can disconnect from the internet after opening the extension, and encrypt being completely offline. So you'll be sure that we don't have a copy of your data or secret word. \n\nIcon credits:\nvSecure icon by Yankoa: yankoa.deviantart.com Under CC license: creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"
