Copy Doc from here:\nhttps://coda.io/@thedayninja/timetocoda\n\n\n** Why I built TimeToCoda **\n\nI love Coda.  Like you, I love to do everything in Coda!  Yet, sometimes that can present a problem:\n\n* Switching between Coda documents back to the time tracker doc I can lose my place;  \n* Tasks I do outside of Coda - I’d like recorded in my time tracker table without opening Coda.\n\nTo solve this I designed TimeToCoda a Google Chrome extension which enables you to access your ‘To-do list’, ‘Projects’ and record the time from the convenience of Chrome whether you are in another Coda doc or some other activity.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Time is more valuable than money. \nYou can get more money but you can’t get more time\" \n\n- Jim Rohan\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \nMore than just time tracking.  Win back time.  Gain insight in your TimeToCoda Dashboard."
