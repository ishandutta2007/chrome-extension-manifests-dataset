I don't think they've targeted this extension specifically, but archive.org will now identify your browser as a bot when using this extension to submit pages for archival. I'm leaving this extension here on the Chrome Web Store because I'm really proud of it, however, it's no longer functional. If you would like to try it out, it may work for awhile, but eventually archive.org will identify you as a bot and block traffic from your browser.\n\nFORMER DESCRIPTION: The Internet Archivist's Intrepid Browser Extension allows users to automatically save the webpages they visit on the Wayback Machine while surfing the World Wide Web. The magic all happens in a non-active browser tab on the left side of Google Chrome while the extension is running. As users browse the web, this non-active tab will continually submit new hyperlinks to the Wayback Machine to be archived. For the best browsing experience, please leave this tab open; there is no need to continually close this tab."
