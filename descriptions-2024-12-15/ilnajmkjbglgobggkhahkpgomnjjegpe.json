Just explain or type in your problem and you will find a solution!\n\nYou can also click on search to make a quick google search!\nThere are many ducks that will be randomly available to help you every time you open the extension.\n\n\"Rubber duck debugging\" is a software engineering method of debugging the code by trying to explain it line-by-line to an inanimate object. This method can obviously be used not only in programming but anywhere you could imagine. The key here is to give a thorough description of your problem, question or anything else that is wracking your brain. \n\nThe Ducks will always be here to help! üê§"
