Press Shift + 5 (% symbol), and voila - only the current individual message is deleted. It performs the same action as clicking the menu button on a message and selecting \"Delete this message.\"\n\nThe best part is you can change this shortcut to anything you want from the extension's Options page.\n\n\nGmail is a trademark of Google LLC. Use of this trademark is subject to Google Permissions. This extension and its developers are in no way associated with Google LLC.\n\n-= Changelog =-\n\n1.5\n  - Shortcuts no longer conflict with Gmail's own keyboard shortcuts.\n  - Updated to Manifest V3\n  - Settings panel now uses Bootstrap (mostly because Manifest V3 removed chrome_style)\n\n1.4\n  - Fixed bugs related to the latest Gmail code changes.\n\n1.3:\n  - Fixed bug where keyboard shortcuts could be activated while typing in some fields.\n\n1.2:\n  - Added support for a secondary shortcut.\n\n1.1:\n  - Fixed bug where delete action would fire if the user was typing in a text field.\n\n1.0:\n  - Initial release."
