The extension focuses on providing a simple and functional solution for those who want to have a consistent and personalized browsing experience across different websites. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, it offers the freedom to create a unique design tailored to individual preferences.\n\nThe extension has two main components:\n1. Custom CSS application: Users can manually create and apply their own custom CSS code, enabling them to change the appearance of every website they visit. This includes altering colors, fonts, layout, and other design elements, providing complete control over the look and feel of each site.\n2. AI-powered CSS generation: For users who may not be familiar with CSS or prefer a more streamlined approach, the extension offers to generate custom CSS code based on a user-provided design description. This allows users to easily implement their desired design changes without having to manually write the code themselves.\nTo utilize the AI feature, users need to supply their own API key for access to OpenAI's AI capabilities. Once the API key is integrated, the extension is ready to use, and users can begin personalizing their browsing experience.\n\nIn summary, \"CSS-WebStyler\" is a functional and versatile Chrome extension that enables users to create a personalized browsing experience by applying custom CSS code to all websites they visit.
