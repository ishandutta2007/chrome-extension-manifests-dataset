Simply click on it, then wait until the ZIP file is generated and downloaded.\n\nWhile generating the ZIP file, do make sure you have the campaign tab focused in chrome (separate it in its own window if needed), otherwise the download speed of the zip will drop to very very slow transfer speeds since the javascript that generates the zip on the fly will be running as a low priority background process.\n\nThe dialog that opens will show you the various steps the script is undertaking and you can click the Log button to see a more detailed log of what is happening. That dialog window will also prevent you from messing around with the campaign. It is best to let the script do its thing unhindered and to not open another campaign in another window. Once the export process is complete, that window will close on its own and the ZIP file will be downloaded automatically.\n\nTo report any issues, please go to the GitHub issue tracker : https://github.com/kakaroto/R20Exporter/issues"
