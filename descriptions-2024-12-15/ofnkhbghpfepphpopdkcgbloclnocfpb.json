Use the  A and D keys or the left and right arrow keys to move left and right. Balls of different colors will start falling down. If you get a green ball you get a point. If you don't you loose 5 points and a live. Your points can't go negative. If you get a red ball you loose 5 points and a life. If you get a blue ball it will bounce up and if you get it again you get 5 points. Nothing happens if you miss a red or blue ball. You loose when you loose all of your lives. After the game it will bring up an end screen what will show your score, the game record, daily record, and if you beat a record. Have fun playing!!!\n\nIdea by: Jacob Ullrich\nProgrammed by: Oh When Games"
