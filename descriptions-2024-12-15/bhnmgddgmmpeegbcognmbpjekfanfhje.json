Simply click the button on the right side of an item and it will remain hidden until you unhide it from the extension popup. You can also hide all items from a specific seller by clicking the button associated with the seller.\n\nWhy is this extension helpful? Well, currently you can't hide individual items on shopping sites like eBay. You can exclude all items from specific sellers using the filter options, but this is not persistent, so you either have to re-enter the filter options every time you start searching eBay, or use a saved search. This extension makes it simple and easy, by allowing you to hide individual items, or all items from a specific seller, at the click of a button."
