Also, allows you to view, open and edit your bookmarks in your browser. Furthermore, enables (optionally) auto-copying new browser bookmarks to pinboard.\n\nWritten in pure Javascript/HTML/CSS without external dependencies (But uses Mozilla's Web Extension Polyfill to be able to handle Chrome's differences (mostly, at least).\n\nDoes not send any data anywhere, as far as I know (except to pinboard, of course).\n\nInstructions\n\n* To connect the add-on with your pinboard account, enter your API key in the options page (about:addons or chrome://extensions). Do not enter your normal password! The key will be stored in the add-on's local browser storage, and I have no idea if other add-ons / users / whoever can access that. Also, it probably wouldn't even work.\n* The API key can be found on https://pinboard.in/settings/password.\n* You can search through your bookmarks, create new ones and edit old ones via the button in the Action Menu (add it to the bar if it is not there)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Changelog (incomplete)\n####v1.5.1\n- Fix regression of not being able to search in the address bar anymore (#62)\n#### v1.5.0\n- Added different search modes in the options:\n  - Result must contain the exact search phrase\n  - Result must contain all words of the search phrase, but in any order (this is the new default)\n  - Result must contain at least one of the words in the search phrase (#57)\n  - Result must match the regular expression search\n- Added an export feature as wished in #55. I was not able to reproduce the reporter's problem though, so I don't see a use case for the export\n  - Export a default bookmark HTML format that can be imported into any browser\n  - Export a JSON document similar to the pinboard export over at [pinboard's backup page](https://pinboard.in/settings/backup)\n- Optimised some code causing API calls to sometimes be fired twice\n- Technical changes\n  - Optimised how the different files / modules reference each other \n  - Updated dependencies\n  - Switched from tslint to eslint\n  - Shrank the 16-pixel icon to actually be 16 pixels wide\n#### v1.4.0\n- Added prettier dark mode and option to use browser/system setting for the dark mode, see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).\n- (#51) Adds keybind Alt+Shift+P to open the create bookmark dialog within the popup ([Firefox only](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browserAction/openPopup))\n- (#51) Adds keybind Alt+Shift+Left to open the sidebar (Firefox only)\n- (#50) Fixes search prefixing and makes search the same across popup, sidebar and browser address bar\n- (#49) Improves tag suggestions when adding a new bookmark \n#### v1.3.7\n* Merged pull request #48, thanks @marcinsmialek! This adds the keyboard shortcut Alt-P (by default) to open the pinboard popup. Also, it fixes the behaviour when searching for bookmarks in the omnibar when no results are found.\n* On development side: updated dependencies. Did not replace tslint by eslint yet because it seems to be quite the task...\n#### v1.3.1 - 1.3.6:\n* Fixed some bugs\n* Started adding keyboard controls to the popup\n* Made the options screen more clear with regards to the API key\n#### v1.3.0:\n* Adds customisable colours: Set the addon to dark mode, light mode, or any colour scheme your heart desires\n* **Firefox only**: Adds a sidebar containing a searchable list of all your bookmarks.\n* Updates icons in the popup\n* Backend stuff:\n  * Updated to v1.2.0 of Mozilla's webextension-polyfill\n  * Streamlined some more code\n  * The icons were unicode characters before, now they are embedded SVG\n  * Moved the filter functionality into appropriate class to try and reduce code duplication\n  * Made background scripts not persistent (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages)"
