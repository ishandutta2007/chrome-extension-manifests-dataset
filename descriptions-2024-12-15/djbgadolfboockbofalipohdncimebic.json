You can choose from 8 different voice options to customize the sound!\nSome of the features of this extension include:\n- Changing voice types by clicking the name below the icons in the extension window (4 male voices, 4 female voices).\n- Customizable pitch and intonation.\n- Typing in caps will have a slightly louder and higher pitch.\n- Playing the number keys will sing notes depending on the selected voice type.\n- Special characters such as '@' or '~' will play unique sound effects (This can be disabled in the extension window).\n\nDue to security restrictions on certain websites this extension will not work on those sites.\n\nThank you and enjoy!"
