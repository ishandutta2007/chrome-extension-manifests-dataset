As a student, I often find it challenging to juggle multiple windows and tabs when doing homework. This extends from my math classes, to chemistry, physics, and engineering. The constant switching between my textbook, browser, and Desmos slows me down and disrupts my workflow. By having Desmos available in a convenient sidebar, users can seamlessly access all the graphing and calculation tools they need without leaving their current page.\n\nFurthermore, with the digital SAT becoming more widespread, Desmos has become an essential tool for test-takers. This extension offers a great opportunity to familiarize yourself with Desmos' features and functionalities in an intuitive, distraction-free environment. Itâ€™s an excellent way to prepare for the exam while developing valuable skills that can boost both efficiency and performance during the test.\n\nThis extension not only makes math homework easier, but it also provides a way to integrate key learning tools for an increasingly digital world, making it more accessible, time-efficient, and effective."
