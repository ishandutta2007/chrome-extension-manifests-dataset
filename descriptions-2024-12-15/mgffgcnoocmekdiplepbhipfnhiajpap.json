Then, wait for the app to load completely. Once the addon is ready, please choose a desired image via the file selector (at the top). When the image is loaded, press the - Start - button. Depending on your machine, it takes up to a few seconds for the AI engine to generate a caption (at the bottom section). \n\nPlease note that this is still a work in progress and might not be able to generate a correct caption (text) for all images. Moreover, during the text generation process, you might see some lags or freezes in your browser. So please be patient until the AI engine completes the job. This addon uses a machine-learning library for the web called Transformers.js (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/). It also uses an image captioning library called VIT-GPT2 (https://huggingface.co/nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning).\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/image-to-text.html)."
