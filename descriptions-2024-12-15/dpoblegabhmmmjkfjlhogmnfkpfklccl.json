Cabin is a Humanist Sans, with a touch of modernism. \n\nOther people this extension is indebted to include Graphic Designer Mike Gangwere (http://uppercasem.prosite.com/), for supplying the sharp, clean logo, and Alex Wolkov, for creating Extensionizr, which enabled me to start building this extension easily.\n\nNOTE: THIS EXTENSION HAS NOT BEEN TESTED MUCH. PLEASE CONTACT ME AT JORDAN@JORDANDAVIS.CA IF SOMETHING IS BROKEN/UGLY OR NOT WORKING."
