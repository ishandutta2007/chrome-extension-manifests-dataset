Dictionary of Numbers takes numbers you're unfamiliar with and puts them in terms you can understand.\n\nDictionary of Numbers scans the web pages you visit looking for numbers it can understand. When it finds one, it will give you a human-understandable meaning for that number. For example, Dictionary of Numbers will take this sentence:\n\n\"The hurricane displaced over 100,000 people and cost an estimated $3 million in damages.\"\n\nAnd turn it into something like this:\n\n\"The hurricane displaced over 100,000 people [≈ population of Aruba] and caused an estimated $3 million [≈ cost of 30-second Super Bowl advertisement] in damages.\"\n\nIt works for hundreds of units and has several thousand human-understandable explanations! If you don't quite understand the explanation, try hovering over it to see the other explanations for what this quantity is like; some will have more options.\n\nDictionary of Numbers also includes a search box for typing/pasting in numbers not in web pages, and will automatically suggest meanings for numbers you type in text boxes (beta feature).\n\nThis extension has the permission to \"access your data on all websites\" because it needs that to inject explanations into the page. It never does anything with your data.\n\nIf something is wrong, please tell me directly so I can fix it!\n\nVersion 1.6.4 (2017/08/02): Fix minor parsing issue.\nVersion 1.6.3 (2013/10/28): Fix minor styling errors.\nVersion 1.6.1 (2013/09/09): Speed improvements.\nVersion 1.5.8 (2013/08/27): Fix linux installs! :D\nVersion 1.5.7 (2013/08/12): Minor styling fix.\nVersion 1.5.6 (2013/08/08): Fix JavaScript console errors.\nVersion 1.5.5 (2013/08/03): Fix interpretation of 'mm Hg' as millimeters.\nVersion 1.5.4 (2013/07/29): Fix error that caused the extension not to work introduced in 1.5.3.\nVersion 1.5.3 (2013/07/28): Now remembers whether it was on or off last time you opened Chrome.\nVersion 1.5.2 (2013/07/18): More speed improvements.\nVersion 1.5.1 (2013/07/16): Speed improvements, especially on Google Images.\nVersion 1.5 (2013/07/14): Remove parentheses from comparisons to ease reading.\nVersion 1.4.8 (2013/07/12): Minor styling fix.\nVersion 1.4.7 (2013/07/07): No longer parsing 'W' as Watts due to too many false positives.\nVersion 1.4.6 (2013/06/26): Minor styling fixes.\nVersion 1.4.4 (2013/06/08): MASSIVE speed improvements and minor quantity parsing fixes.\nVersion 1.3.0 (2013/06/01): Now parsing shortened orders of magnitude on currency e.g. '$100k' will be parsed as $100,000.\nVersion 1.2 (2013/05/23): Fix bug with removing content in textareas and hopefully speed improvements.\nVersion 1.1.1: Disable as-you-type suggestions to stop modification of textareas.\nVersion 1.1.0: Don't show lower-end money amounts people are already familiar with.\nVersion 1.0.10: More minor styling fixes.\nVersion 1.0.9: Minor styling fixes."
