Built in browser gives the ability to debug locally hosted applications. And, the possibility of accessing all browser features just in a tab change saves a lots of development time when it comes to debugging. The current version of the application provides the HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax highlighting with the commonly used file operations. The dark theme in the text editor makes the developers easy to recognize code snippets. Stay tuned with the NewLine Text Editor to experience more features on it."
