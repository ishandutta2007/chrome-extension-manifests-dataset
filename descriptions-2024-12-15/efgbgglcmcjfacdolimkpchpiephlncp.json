When the button is clicked, the comedic slay sound effect is played. \n\nUses for this range from celebrating the completion of a project or providing a quick pick me up when hard at work online, to simply commending a friend for a witty comment when studying with a group. Additionally, this extension provides a fun way to test computer audio and hear the current volume levels by listening for the audio produced when the button is clicked.\n\nOriginally starting as a gag between a group of developers, ultimately creating various versions of this button across multiple platforms, the slay button has begun to gain traction in its many forms among their local community. This much anticipated extension hopes to bring the slay button to a wider audience in a more accessible format with greater ease of use."
