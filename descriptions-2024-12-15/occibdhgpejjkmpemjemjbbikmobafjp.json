Do you procrastinate on things that you started at 2am with great motivation? Is your B2B Saas still doing 0$ MRR?\n\nDid you remember Lord Ganesha before doing a git init? That's the reason you give up at the slightest of hindrance, what's the solution you ask? Invoke Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, to bring success and good fortune before you start to work on a new idea.\n\nStart your new virtual projects with an auspicious beginning using the \"Shri Ganesh\" Chrome extension. Inspired by the traditional Hindu practice of invoking Lord Ganesha before embarking on a new endeavor, this extension helps users perform a symbolic 'Shri Ganesh' as they create a new project. \n\nA simple ritual for a smooth and blessed(based) project journey!"
