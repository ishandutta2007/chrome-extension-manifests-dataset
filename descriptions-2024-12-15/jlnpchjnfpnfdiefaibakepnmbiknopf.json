It is designed to work with Google Chrome and uses a content script to extract order information from a web page. The agent can then fill out a form with additional information, such as the payment method, a complaint, and a note. This information is then stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet using a Google Apps Script. The extension also includes functionality to check if an order has already been logged, and if so, display the previous notes and complaints for that order. The agent's name can be stored in local storage to save time and improve efficiency. Overall, this extension aims to streamline the process of submitting and tracking complaints and notes for customer orders, making it easier for agents to provide excellent customer service."
