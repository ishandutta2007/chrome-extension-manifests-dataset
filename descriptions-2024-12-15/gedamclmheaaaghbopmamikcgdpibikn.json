While it does work for larger widths, it was designed for screens in the 800px to 1050px range, ish. Really it should work for any width.\n\nAs always with my extensions, full code is at github: https://github.com/travisjj/StackNarrow\n\n - v1.1: Small css fix for user preferences page\n - v1.2: Removed the list selector relocation, as it was causing tearing during page load, and also was no longer where it used to be so it was not problematic to the width of the page.\n - v1.3: Also support new https:// that is rolling out\n - v1.4: changed class name selector due to SO update\n - v1.5: updated footer container width due to SO update\n - v1.6,1.7: updated css to increase specificity for specific question page"
