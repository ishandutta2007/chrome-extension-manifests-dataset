It works better than this extension, so I recommend that you try to use the built-in feature instead of this extension. Please learn how to use the built-in feature here: https://github.com/stefansundin/one-click-screenshot/discussions/15\n\nThis extension is very simple. With just a few clicks, you can take a screenshot of an entire website and save it to a png file. There is no bloat or any fancy post-processing. There's also a keyboard shortcut that you can use.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/stefansundin/one-click-screenshot"
