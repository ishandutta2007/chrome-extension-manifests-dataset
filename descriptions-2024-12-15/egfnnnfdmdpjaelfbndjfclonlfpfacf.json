Just click on the little icon that comes up in the search bar of your browser to see all of the applications that the Inspector recognizes.\n\nIt will tell you if it is built with Wordpress, Drupal, or Joomla for example.   \n\nIt will tell you also if the site is using IIS, Apache, Nginx, for example as well.\n\nThe code makes all of it analysis locally, it doesn't make external calls.  You can confirm this with TCPView or other tools if you are interested.   \n\nThis is open source code that has been modified from the original work available at https://github.com/nqbao/chromesniffer.  This modification includes an HTML icon which should show up on all websites even if the Inspector doesn't recognize anything else."
