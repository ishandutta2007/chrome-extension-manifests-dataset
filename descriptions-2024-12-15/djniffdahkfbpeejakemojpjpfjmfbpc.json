Fed up having to scroll all the way down a page of results just to find that the site you're looking for isn't even on that page of results? \n\nWell here's the answer! Type in the domain name you're looking for, select a colour and this handy little extension will hi-light the matching search results so you can scroll quickly down the page and find the result you're looking for. \n\nThis handy extension will even tell you the highest position of what you are looking for and if it shows zero you'll know that it isn't on that page at all. Allowing you to skip to the next page of results without having to wade through all the results to find something that isn't there."
