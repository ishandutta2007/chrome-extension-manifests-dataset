The new system uses different storage, so your homepage url has been deleted. You just need to re-add it (via right-click > options).\n\nRegarding new installs: you have to click the Extensions icon at the top-right of Chrome and pin the new extension in order to see it in your top-bar. Clicking this new home button initially redirects your current tab to Google. Right-click the new home button and choose Options to edit the home-page urls. You can also choose a white icon if you have a dark theme. You can hide the official home button at top left via: Chrome Settings > Appearance > Show home button > Disabled.\n\nThis extension only uses the storage permission to remember your settings. This extension never monitors your activity. It only redirects your tabs when requested. The source code is very simple and is posted here https://holtstrom.com/michael/blog/post/412/Home-Button-At-Top-Right-Chrome-Extension.html, so you can inspect it for yourself. Use the \"Feedback\" button at the top of that article if you want to ask any questions. Be sure to include contact info if you want a reply.\n\nThis extension will always be free and will never have ads.\n\nSome people want to link to a local url like \"file:///C:/MyFolder/MyFile.html\". As described at the above link, Chrome 118 and later removed the ability to redirect to local files. You can enable local navigation for this extension in your windows registry as shown below. \n\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Google\\Chrome\nExtensionSettings = { \"bfejcgpdahgpmgadhgdadfiekmhgnifm\": { \"file_url_navigation_allowed\": true}}"
