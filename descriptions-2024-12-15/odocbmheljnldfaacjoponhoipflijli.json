This guide can be helpful when trying to get ungated in the beauty, grocery, health & personal care, automotive, clothing, jewelry, luggage, shoes/bags/sunglasses, video/dvd and watches categories. The guide will attempt to be updated with new sources for invoices that appear to be working for other sellers.\n\nThe guide gives direct links to each of the listed categories above and provides helpful notes/tips through the process.\n\nIf you are new to Amazon ungating or having a tough time getting approved, this tool may help!\n\nThe Ungated Guide tool is just meant to be a helpful guide and is not an ungating service. This tool does not do any ungating for you or guarantee any ungating results. It is simply meant to help you through the process in a way that follows Amazon's rules for ungating."
