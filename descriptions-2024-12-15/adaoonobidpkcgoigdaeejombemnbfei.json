It auto-translates certain math notations (such as decimal points to decimal commas) based on your locale via an extra button in the Crowdin window. \n\nAdd this extension to your Chrome browser (it is also available in Firefox) and you'll see a new button next to the \"copy source button\". The icon is the same with an added comma inside. :-)\n\nIMPORTANT: You have to set your locale in the plugin options! \n1. Open chrome://extensions \n2. Find Khan Academy Dots plugin and click on \"Details\"\n3. Scroll down a little bit until you see Extension Options, which should pop-up a language dropdown menu.\n\nTechnical note: The translation engine was extracted from Translation Assistant and is thus compatible with Smart Translations inside the Translation Editor (available at khanacademy.org/translations)."
