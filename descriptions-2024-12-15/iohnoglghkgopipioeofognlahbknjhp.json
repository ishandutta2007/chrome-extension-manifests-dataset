Through the interface, you can create various sections for each person, going to insert numerous images related to that specific person. Importing images can be done either from local or from context menu by interacting with images on the web. So that content obscuration is more accurate, it is good to import multiple photos of a character with various poses and angles, and with good resolution. Face detection may lead to minor slowdowns during browsing, which may be more or less important depending on the type of hardware in your device.\n\nRemember: after making a setting change from the interface, or after importing images, you have to reload the web page for the extension to apply the new changes on it. Also, you have to enable Chrome browser notifications to receive messages about various operations."
