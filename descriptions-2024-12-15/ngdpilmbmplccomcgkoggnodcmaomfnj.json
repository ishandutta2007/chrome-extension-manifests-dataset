It automates the Steam key activation process and marks which account Steam keys have been redeemed to.\n\nHumble Pal also adds a search Steam store right click menu item when highlighting text on Humble Bundle to make it easier to find the official Steam store page of apps.\n\nNOTE: The Steam key activation website is automated regardless of if the source is from a Humble Bundle link (and if the key is found on Humble Bundle it will be marked accordingly). This is intentional behavior for now as some users may prefer to only use the Steam automation (aka getting your keys from Humble Bundle is not required to use the automation). If this behavior causes problems it will be reduced.\n\nBEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD - IMPORTANT!!\nWith great automation comes great responsibility. All key activation links are fully automated, so click wisely. Steam will likely be unable to help with accidentally redeemed keys.\n\nBy downloading this extension you are agreeing to the Steam subscriber agreement located at https://store.steampowered.com/checkout/ssapopup. Humble Pal automates duplicated requests to agree to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, but does not absolve you from the responsibility of that agreement. Your legal obligations to Steam and Humble Bundle are in no way modified by the use of this software.\n\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Chad Bailey (github.com/chadbailey)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
