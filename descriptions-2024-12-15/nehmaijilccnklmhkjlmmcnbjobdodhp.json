On any website, you can select a long, boring article, right-click and summarise it in a few sentences!\n\nThis even works for those long PDF publications from prestigious universities you don't want to read.\n\nAdditionally, for you Redditers out there - good news! Long comments are automatically summarised, with any \"tl;dr\" placed at the *top* of the comment, along with the automatically-generated summary.\n\nNew Features:\n- Automatic Imperial-to-metric converter for lengths and weights - across all sites!\n- Improved summarizer will detect sentences better.\n\n\nMore sites and features to come! Tell me what you want in the feedback section.\n\nFeedback is important to me and hope this extension saves you time too. Let me know of any bugs (currently in Beta) or features to add."
