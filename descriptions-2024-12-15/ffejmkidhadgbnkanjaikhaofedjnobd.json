How much time did that really take out of your day? Curious about how many purchases you made online this month? Can't remember the name of that recipe you used the other day?\n\nMy Browsing Habits monitors your web surfing activities automatically, keeping you accountable for how you spend your time.

These manual inputs can then also be compared with other activities tracked automatically. \n\n\nWith the 3 free activities you can begin tracking your browsing right away!
