Every time a cookie is inserted onto your computer, deleted from your computer or overwritten a sound is triggered. Signature sounds have been designed for the most commonly browsed platforms, e.g. Google, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon and more. The options interface allows one to change the pitch and volume of the cookie data in real time.\nBy translating cookies into sound Listening Back provides an audible presence for\nhidden infrastructures that collect personal and identifying data by storing a file on oneâ€™s\ncomputer. Listening Back therefore functions to expose real-time digital surveillance and\nconsequently the ways in which our everyday relationships to being surveilled have\nbecome normalised.\nEnjoy!"
