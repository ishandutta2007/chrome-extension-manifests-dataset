There is also 19-year view which helps to visualize lunar metonic cycle and leap years.\n\nIn a default monthly view you can hover over any date and see the corresponding Gregorian date, moon phase, and also sunrise/sunset times in your location as long as it could be determined and your browser is allowed to access it.\n\nThis extension is 100% offline, accesses no remote resources whatsoever, it will happily work without internet access, and it doesn’t track you in any way; all information it saves is saved locally in your browser.\n\nNOTE: Current implementation is somewhat old (I created it back in 2019, but never published until now), doesn’t yet take advantage of some new API for Chrome extension and UI could be better. I am working on a new version, but in the meantime, current version is entirely usable, so please enjoy it."
