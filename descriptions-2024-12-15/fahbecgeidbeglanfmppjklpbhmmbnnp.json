This is a one-time step. This extension won't work if you have 'blocked' notifications.\n\nNote: Windows 10 users might have to change 'Focus Assist' settings to get notifications while they're in an full-screen application.\n\nGoogle Meet is a trademark of Google Inc.\nUse of this trademark is subject to Google Permissions."
