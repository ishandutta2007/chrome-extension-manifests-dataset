Seller feedback isn't always reliable, and photos can deceive. That's where Vinyl Inspector comes in. Our extension empowers you to see beyond the surface, revealing the true condition of the vinyl records you're interested in.\n\nWith Vinyl Inspector, you can stop buying scratched vinyl. Instead, use this extension to click on an image and pre-process it to emphasize scratches that are not initially visible.\n\nWith the free Chrome extension, you can inspect one photo per hour. If you want to inspect more photos, there's a one time fee of $15.\n\nOur image processing helps identify scratches in many images of records, but there are some limitations. This detection is less effective at low resolution images. Strong lighting or deep shadows over an image may obscure the information necessary to make scratches visible. If there is a clear, high resolution photo of the record like the example above, we typically give good results. We cannot guarantee that we will detect all scratches, but we do help in many cases."
