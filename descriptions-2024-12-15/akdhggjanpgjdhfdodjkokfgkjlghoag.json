A Min value and a Max value. Both Min and Max are inclusive values in the result. \nIt is possible to choose the quantity of the numbers to be generated, for instance, like a dice, you can choose numbers between 1 and 6, and if you need 20 numbers, a possible result could be something like:\n3 3 5 6 2 1 6 4 1 6 2 1 2 2 4 3 6 5 2 1 (generated by this extension).\nThe generated numbers follows a uniform distribution. \nThe extension uses the chrome storage to keep the chosen values between sessions and browsers in sync.\nIn future versions I hope to generate number from different distributions like Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial and Exponential.\nHope it can be useful to you. Sometimes we think we don't need something like this, until the day we have it!\nPlease, use it, be free to return feedback for improvements or reports about something that's not working as expected."
