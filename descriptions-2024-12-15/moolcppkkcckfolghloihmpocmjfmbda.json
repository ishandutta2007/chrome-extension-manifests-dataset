Keeping galleries on multiple art websites can be a chore. This extension automates the repetitive parts.\n\nAdd your Title, Description, Tags to the file's metadata, and when you select them to upload, flufftagger will fill the submission form.\n\nRuns in your browser, does not your password or credentials. Does not put more load on the server than submitting manually. Open Source, Free Software.\n\nCurrently supports Fur Affinity, and Weasyl. Want to see another site supported? Let me know, or contribute!\n\n* Note: right now, only reading XMP/IPTC metadata is implemented, not Exif. Also Reading tags from Windows Explorer doesn't work yet :(\n\nTo get the source, report an issue, etc. : https://github.com/Kakurady/flufftagger"
