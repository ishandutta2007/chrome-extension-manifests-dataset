If YouTube loads other videos using for example ajax they will be displayed without any changes.\n\nV1.2. bug fix for the popup and some smaller issues with the sync. storage.\n\nV1.1\nThe extension is now using sync. storage. Should help you if you are working on multiple systems. Also you can now repress the button to deselect a video. The video will then be removed from your history.\n\nV1.0\nalpha version - please do not expect anything to work. If you need features, send an email to: info@webagent.eu and it will be implemented. Thanks!"
