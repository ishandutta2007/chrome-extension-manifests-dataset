It can turn of gravity or make the contents on any page hilarious.\n\nWhen making this plugin, I laughed so hard that I cried and my sides hurt. Since it's random, not every page will be equally as funny on the first click, but there will always be gems.\n\nA lot of bigger or very specific words don't get replaced, so the page retains the general structure, topic and flow, but the details get changed around and that makes all the difference.\n\nIn my experience, a body of text with a lower reading level makes for more funny results from the text substitutions, but that's just my opinion, so do with that info what you will.\n\nIt doesn't work on PDF's, just web pages, and it doesn't work on some of the built-in browser content.\n\nThat app doesn't make money, doesn't track your data, and just exists for fun. It was made because I found it such a joy, and I wanted to share that joy.\n\nI hope others can get just as much fun out of this as I do!\n\n* I do not take responsibility for any time wasted from using this plugin."
