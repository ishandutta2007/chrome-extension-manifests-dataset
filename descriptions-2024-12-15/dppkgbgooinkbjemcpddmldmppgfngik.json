When you close your tabs, Hide!!! will also redirect you to a safe page so you can disguise what you were doing. If the option is enabled, Hide!!! can also clear your history--to fully cover your tracks.\n\nBy default, the hotkeys are (Alt + P) to \"hide\" and (Alt + O) to \"restore\". The default redirection page is \"google.com\". To change these settings and more, click on the Hide!!! icon in your Chrome Toolbar.\n\n=======================================================\n\nTo see the source code for our project, please visit https://github.com/velvet-market/Hide\n\nMade by Velvet Market.
