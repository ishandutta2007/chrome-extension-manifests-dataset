The environment supports full mathematical expressions thanks to the internal MathJS library. You can use matrixes, arrays, and complex numbers. To ease the usage, you can even write JavaScript functions and use those functions in your mathematical sandbox.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Supports numbers, big numbers, complex numbers, fractions, and units\n2. Supports strings, arrays, and matrices.\n3. Supports symbolic computation\n4. Comes with a large set of built-in functions and constants.\n5. Comes with a built-in plotting tool\n6. Supports as many computational boxes as needed\n7. Supports keyboard navigation between the boxes, and you can evaluate each box whenever needed.\n8. Runs the evaluation in a sandboxed window\n\nThis extension uses the following libraries:\n1. math.js\n2. Chart.js\n3. Notify.js\n4. Workspace.js\n\nThe extension has a powerful built-in plotting tool. Make sure to visit the FAQs page for more info."
