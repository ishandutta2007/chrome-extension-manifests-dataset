In the absence of any checks on this system, trust on the internet will gradually erode until there is no objective truth left.\n\nThis is a companion tool that aims to counter that trend, ironically using Generative AI itself to do it.\n\nCurrently, it works on Old Reddit comments, including a \"Validate Claim\" button on every comment with a link. When you click on the button, an analysis is kicked off to (1) extract all the claims the user is making, (2) pull all the information from their source, and (3) check whether each claim is substantiated by the source. Steps 1 and 3 are done by instruction fine-tuned LLMs.\n\nThis is an open-source project in active development. Future updates will include:\n1. Support multiple sources in the same comment\n2. Looking at nearby comments to better understand the claims a user is trying to make\n3. Support Reddit posts in addition to comments\n4. Support for more websites, including Twitter and Wikipedia\n5. Additional tools beyond just claim verification\n\nNOTE: This extension is totally free to use, but uses my personal API keys (now using Groq for faster results!) for the time being. If you'd like to support the project, first and foremost looking for contributors, but would of course also appreciate any donations: https://ko-fi.com/veezbo"
