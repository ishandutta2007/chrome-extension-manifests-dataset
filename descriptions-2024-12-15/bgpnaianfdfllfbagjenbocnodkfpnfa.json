It uses Prosfinity unique AI technology to detect Zero Day Phishing URLs, including Phishing attacks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n[PhishNet AI One and PhishNet AI Two] AI PhishNet uses two different AI models to analyze different aspects of a URL, in order to better detect Phishing attacks. PhishNet AI One focuses on the domain name, while PhishNet AI Two focuses on the pattern and signature.\n\n[Manage Whitelist] You can whitelist domains and URLs that you trust, so that they are not flagged as Phishing sites.\n\n[Warning Alert Page] AI PhishNet has an alert page that will show you a warning if you visit a Phishing site. The alert page will provide you with information about the Phishing site, such as the type of Phishing attack it is attempting to carry out and the potential consequences of falling victim to the attack.\n\n[Neutral Alert Page] AI PhishNet also has a neutral page, which is shown if AI PhishNet is matched one of our AI. The neutral page will provide you with more information about the site.\n\n[Login for Company-Level Protection] Businesses can log in to AI PhishNet with their Company ID to get company-level protection. This will allow you to manage whitelists, set alert settings, view reports on Phishing activity.\n\n[Intensive Mode] In Intensive Mode, AI PhishNet will analyze the entire URL, including the domain name, the path, and the query string. This mode is more secure, but it may also result in more false positives.\n\n[Alert Mode] In Alert Mode, AI PhishNet will show you a warning for any site that it suspects may be Phishing. This mode is the most secure, but it is also the most likely to result in false positives.\n\n[Phishing User Awareness Training] AI PhishNet also implements Phishing User Awareness Training on the Alert Page. This training is designed to teach users about the different types of Phishing attacks and how to spot them. The training also includes tips on how to avoid falling victim to Phishing attacks."
