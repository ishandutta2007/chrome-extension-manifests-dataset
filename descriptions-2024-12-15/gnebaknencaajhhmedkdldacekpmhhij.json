Only those websites you give permission will be cataloged and passwords will not be saved.\n\nEstatePlan Assist eliminates the need for you to manually catalog your digital accounts (e.g. email, social media, etc...). It is important to catalog (and keep updated) your key digital accounts for your Executor to properly close them out after you are gone. \n\nUnfortunately, “ghosting” – which refers to identity theft of a deceased person used for financial gain/fraud - is becoming increasingly prevalent and is a critical issue because it may remain undetected for long periods of time, allowing the fraudster to continue to benefit from the deceased person’s stolen identity.\n\nThe EstatePlan Assist Chrome Extension tool is a simple but powerful tool that allows you to automatically catalog the basic information about your digital accounts as you go about your everyday tasks and visit / use your web accounts. This tool serves an invaluable purpose in helping your Executor to settle your estate and quickly close or memorialize the important accounts to prevent them from being ghosted."
