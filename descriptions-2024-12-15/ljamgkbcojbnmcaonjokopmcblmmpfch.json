You no longer need to be incognito.\n\nThis is a feature in Firefox that many people feel is missing in Chrome. Google will no doubt add this functionality at some stage. Until they do, you can use the No History extension!\n\nOne good feature is the ability to 'toggle' the extension on and off. \n\nIt's very simple and only took me a couple of hours to put together at a friends request.\n\n----\n\nFor those saying this extension isn't working watch this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bfeyE4ZseU and then file a bug telling me how it's working differently for you. I can't fix any bug I can't replicate.\n\n----\nJune 2013\n\nI totally forgot about this extension until Google emailed me saying I need to update the manifest. It's amazing that people are actually using it - you're awesome!! \n\nThis really was an extension I made in literally an hour the week before Christmas a few years ago. I'll read through your reviews and try and implement the white/black list you've asked for shortly. \n\nThanks again!\n\n-----\n\nChange log:\n\nVersion 1.0.2\n\n- Updated manifest to Version 2.\n\nVersion 1.0.1\n\n- Fixed state reset bug."
