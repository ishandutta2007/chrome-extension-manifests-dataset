The typical use case is a third-party login flow. In production the developer's code wil run on the same domain as the other services and have access to the cookies they set.\nBut when code is running on localhost (during development), those cookies are not accessible in the browser. This add on makes those cookies available on localhost, so available to the developer's local code."
