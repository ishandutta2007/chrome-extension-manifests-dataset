You can also redirect messages to the EventGhost plugin for total automation. More info on EventGhost here: http://joaoapps.com/autoremote/eventghost/\n\nFor example, you can setup a Command that will create a \"call\" command. This way, when you select a phone number on any webpage, just send it with the call command to your phone, and a \"call=:=NR_HERE\" command will be sent. In Tasker, setup an AutoRemote profile with a \"call=:=\" message filter and with a direct call task where you use the \"%arcomm\" variable as a phone number\n\nQuickstart guide:\n - Start by adding your Android devices at the top\n - Add any commandyou want at the bottom. Rules will be setup one by one for the devices you choose.\n - If you check the \"Don't send right-click selection with this command\" checkbox, the selection you choose on a page when you right-click it, won't be sent with the message.\n- You can also use keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+1 to Ctrl+Shift+4 to quickly use the commands you have defined."
