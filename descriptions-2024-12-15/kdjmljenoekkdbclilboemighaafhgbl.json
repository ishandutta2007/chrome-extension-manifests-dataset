This tool is data driven. We have also developed a Chrome Extension as a primary utility to capture new test cases. The Chrome Extension called \"autoium\" will allow registered users on \"autoium.net\" to connect to the testing database, and then navigate through the web application that needs to be tester. The extension will capture the XPATH or field Id of the HTML element that is to be tested. After capturing the individual test cases. they get scheduled to be tested regularly from the testing database. Hence making sure that regression test cases are automatically tested and any functional anomaly or failure is reported to application owners. All communication between the extension and our database happens on a SSL (https) layer."
