Each row is one year of your life leading up to your birthday. Together it shows every week of your life until you are 80 years old.\n\nmori helps you focus on tasks that are important, achieve goals, stay in the moment and accept death. Use the information to your advantage.\n\nTo change the date click the date and a popup will show.\n\nFor comments / suggestions you can email me at: jordan@howlett.io\n\nStay tuned for alternate versions!\n\nUpdate June 2014:\n\nHover over blocks to show age / month. Remove some of the sidebar items, for now. They were breaking on some platforms. Would need a better way to show them."
