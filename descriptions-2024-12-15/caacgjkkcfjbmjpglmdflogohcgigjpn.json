She graduated with a BFA in illustration from Pacific Northwest College of Art in Portland, OR. She makes images using colorful blocky shapes and loose line work inspired by themes of home, culture, and identity.  When she’s not drawing, she’s probably eating butter chicken or tuna kimbap somewhere."
