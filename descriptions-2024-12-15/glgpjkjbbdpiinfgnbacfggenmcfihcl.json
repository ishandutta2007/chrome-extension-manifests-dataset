For those that are technical, this extension works a lot like \"git checkout\" for the browser.  Another analogy is that it works like \"tmux\" for the browser.  For those who are not technical, you can quickly select and highlight the tabs that you need while also being able to switch between different window sessions with all their tabs preserved as they were before you switched away.  Also, you can archive any tab, and revisit or reopen it later in a quick and painless way."
