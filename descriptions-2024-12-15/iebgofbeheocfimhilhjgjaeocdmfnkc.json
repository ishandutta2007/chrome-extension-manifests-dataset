You can click on any of the bookmarks to go to that page. Each bookmark also has a button that links to the folder where the bookmark is stored. That will take you to the \"Folder View\".\n\n\"Get Random Folder\" is another way to get to the \"Folder View\" It randomly selects a folder from your saved bookmarks and display all the bookmarks in that folder. You can click to go to any bookmark. There is also a menu at the top that lets you navigate up and down your folder structure.\n\nI created this extension because I had thousands of saved bookmarks. Too many to even remember. This extension creates a fun an engaging way to browse through your saved bookmarks and rediscover your interests and things you saved to read later.\n\nIt works best if your bookmarks are organized by interest or topics; but, anyone with a ton of bookmarks can use this to explore what they have saved.\n\nHave fun and I hope you like it."
