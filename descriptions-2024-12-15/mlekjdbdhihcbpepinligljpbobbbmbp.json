When creating snapshots or just selecting multiple items, this extension will save you time. While it may be easy to select 5 records, when you have 50 or 500 to select that can take forever. This extension can help get that accomplished in less time. \n\nDirections:\nUse a spreadsheet app(Google Sheets, Excel, etc.) and the TextJoin formula to format your data. Then copy/paste the result in the extension. Click the green button - \"Check checkboxes\" and you are done.\n\nExample:\n-If the student ids are in column A then your \"Range\" would be something like A2:A80 depending on how many ids you are selecting.\n\n-Type the following formula in an empty cell  =TextJoin(\",\",TRUE,A2:A80)\n\n-Then just copy/paste the comma separated data into the extension. If your data has commas already in it like LastName, FirstName, check the box in the extension."
