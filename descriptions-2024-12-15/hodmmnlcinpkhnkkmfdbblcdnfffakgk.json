TV Chart lets you see a user rating graph of any TV show, straight from Netflix!\nAfter you install the extension, a little graph icon will be added to shows' description on Netflix. Click it, and the rating chart pops up! \n\nThe charts will display the ratings across all of their seasons and episodes, which makes it easy to figure out if they’re worth watching. You’ll be able to tell if a show has been consistently good, and also quickly find the best and worst episodes in the series.\n\nPlease note that at the moment, TV Chart only works when the language on your Netflix account is set to English.\n\nFor rating charts of shows that are not on Netflix, go to tvchart.benmiz.com"
