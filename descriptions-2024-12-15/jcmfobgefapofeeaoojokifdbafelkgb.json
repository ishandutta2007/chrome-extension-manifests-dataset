I could not find a similar site that allowed users to change the amount of VAT so created this so that business users and individuals have access to a calculator where the VAT rate could be changed and VAT could be added to a net amount or subtracted from a gross amount in an easy manner.\n\nThe VAT rate for the UK currently stands at 20 per cent, this was changed from 17.5 per cent on the 4th of January 2011.  The standard rate of VAT was temporarily reduced to 15 per cent on 1 December 2008. This was put back to 17.5% on the 20th January 20"
