This makes it easier for users to see whether the extension is actively listening for voice input.\nRobust Speech Recognition Handling:\n\nSpeech recognition is now more reliable, with improved handling of start and stop commands. The extension seamlessly manages the state of the speech recognition service, even when switching between tabs.\nError Handling and Debugging:\n\nAdded comprehensive error handling for speech recognition, addressing issues like 'no-speech' errors and ensuring the extension continues to function smoothly.\nImproved console logging for easier debugging and troubleshooting.\nPerformance Improvements:\nEfficient Script Injection:\n\nOptimized the way scripts are injected into web pages, reducing the likelihood of conflicts with site-specific scripts or policies.\nDelayed Stop for Continuous Listening:\n\nImplemented a delay mechanism that keeps the speech recognition active for a period after the last speech is detected, enhancing the user experience during continuous use.\nCompatibility Notes:\nThe extension is now tested and confirmed to work on a wider range of websites. However, users may still experience limited functionality on sites with strict Content Security Policies (CSP) or complex input field controls, such as the main Google Search page.\nBest performance is observed on sites with standard HTML input fields.\nUser Experience:\nUsers are encouraged to provide feedback on their experience with the extension, especially regarding its functionality on different websites. This feedback will be invaluable for future updates and enhancements."
