Unlike other converters, Conveuro can detect the currency, so you don't have to explicitly select it. You can type \"25 thousand canadian dollars\", for example, and get exactly what you're looking for.\n\nAll you have to do is open the popup, set what currencies you're interested in and preferably put the most important ones at the beginning."
