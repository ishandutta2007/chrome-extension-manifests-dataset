These platforms, which you are likely already familiar with, offer powerful features and ecosystems without incurring additional costs. For instance, with Notion, your data syncs, allowing you to edit your how-to guides, export, share, and more.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Supports recording any webpage\n- Supports anything on any webpage\n- Highlights procedural screenshots\n- one how-to guides can span across browser tabs and windows\n- Save to Notion and Notion-like platforms\n- Privacy protection, completely free, and no login required"
