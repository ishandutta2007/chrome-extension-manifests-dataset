They were either too clunky, packed with features I never used, or just didn’t stick around when I needed them most. I needed something that was dead simple, without any bells and whistles, that would let me jot down my tasks quickly and keep them in sight. So, I created \"Really Simple TODO\" for myself, and now I'm sharing it with you.\n\nWhy \"Really Simple TODO\"?\n\nIt's as straightforward as it gets. You click, you type, you hit enter. That's it—your task is there, waiting for you, until you're ready to tick it off. This little tool lives in your Chrome browser, which, if you're anything like me, is where you spend most of your day anyway. It’s always there, one click away, no matter what other tabs you’ve got open.\n\nKey Features:\n\nSimplicity at Its Core: With a clean and intuitive interface, adding and managing your tasks is a breeze.\nPersistent Memory: Your to-dos stick around, even if you close your browser, so you'll never lose track of your tasks.\nQuick Access: A single click on the toolbar icon drops down your list, letting you add or cross off items in no time.\nFocused Functionality: No feature bloat or unnecessary buttons. It's all about capturing your tasks and getting things done.\nLightweight Design: It won't hog your system's resources, ensuring your browser stays snappy and responsive.\n\nFrom Me to You:\n\nI built \"Really Simple TODO\" because I couldn't find an extension that was simple enough yet always on hand. If you find yourself needing a to-do list that isn’t bloated with features that sound nice on paper but you never use in real life, this might be the tool for you. It's straightforward, and it does the job without any fuss."
