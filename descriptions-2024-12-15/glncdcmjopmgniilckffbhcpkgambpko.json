It makes some letters extra bold to make reading fast and keep effort low. This is a free alternative to Bionic Reading and Open Dyslexic font, and is great for folks with ADHD, dyslexia, or anyone whose brain gets bored easily when reading.\n\nAaRead helps you stay focused on what you’re reading, and it’s way easier on your eyes too! Wanna try it on your favorite website? Simply click the extension icon or use the quick shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd + 0), and reading Reddit, Twitter, your study materials, news, or anything else should feel much better :)\n\nMy goal is to make this extension awesome for everyone, so please share your ideas or just let me know how much you love it (if you do, of course...).\n\nEnjoy your reading! :)"
