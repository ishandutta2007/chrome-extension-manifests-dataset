The Roll20.net site facilitates role playing gaming in a safe, socially-distanced virtual environment.  This plugin allows users of the Merisyl character sheets to send die rolls for gaming through the Roll20.net site.  The character statistics (saving throws, attack rolls, skill checks, etc) are entered into the Roll20.net rolling interface as if the user had typed them there and hit \"submit\".  The page contents are not altered in any other way, and the normal functioning of both the Merisyl site and Roll20 site are otherwise unaffected.\n\nUsers of the Merisyl Pathfinder character sheets who desire a smoother integration with the Roll20.net gaming site should install this plugin to eliminate manual steps."
