This allows us a controlled way of experimenting without alienating the users who depend on the reliability of this tool.\n\nAt any given time this version may be in a broken state, and the reliability is not guaranteed. This is why it is called experimental. If you want the version which is stable and strives to work well for all users all the time, please get Video Speed Controller.\n\nI think I may have made the point clear, but I do think it bears repeating. The goal of this effort is not to fork the parent project and create a \"better\" version of it, but rather to have a playground for testing out ideas with the expectation of either removing it all together or adding it into the parent project."
