Scrum for Trello is working again!\n\n** Update Sep 4, 2012 **\n\n- Added a nice feature contributed by Cedric Gatay:\nOne thing we use often is surrounding points of done tasks with [] to prevent them for being counted by the plugin in the list total.\n\nThis contain the ability to display such tasks with a decent style (half-transparency) on cards and a differentiated total shown on lists.\n\n\n\nTrello is the perfect online equivalent of the whiteboard with sticky notes aka the Scrum board. We love this app and started using it immediately after launch.\n\nOne element we use a lot in our projects are the storypoints. Scrum for Trello gives you the ability to make use of story points within Trello.\n\nSetup\n\nScrum for Trello is a Chrome extension and you can install it via the Chrome Webstore.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIn the card titles you can add the storypoints between parentheses. The assigned points will be picked up by Scrum for Trello and displayed in the upper right corner of the card.\n\nFor each list the total amount of story points will be calculated and shown in the title of the list.\n\nEvery second the story points will be detected and calculated. So changing a number or moving a card will be reflected almost immediately.\n\nUpdates\n\nGreat improvements made by @nicpottier and @paullofte:\n* The point value is moved to be a badge on the card.\n* Added support for Zero Point Cards (0), Unknown Point Cards (?), Decimal Value Cards (.5)\n* In addition I added the functionality to have the list total reflect the current filtered set of cards.\n\nMore great improvements\n* @bastiaanterhorst created a storypoint icon to fit in nicely with the Trello style\n* bugfixes by @mgan59\n* A very cool storypoint picker made by @nicpottier was integrated and adapted. Click on the title in the card view and a little menu shows you available points to quickly select. Of course you can add your own points between parentheses still.\n\nCredits\n\nScrum for Trello was developed by Marcel Duin (http://webglmarcel.q42.net/) and Jasper Kaizer (https://twitter.com/jkaizer) during our pet projects time at Q42 (http://q42.com).\nThey team up with Sean Colombo (https://twitter.com/seancolombo).\n\nYou can download the source code at http://github.com/Q42/TrelloScrum. Or even better, improve it and do a pull request!\n\nPrivacy\n\nScrum for Trello runs locally only and stores nothing on any server!\n\nSee: http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/23462/what-kind-of-data-does-trelloscrum-keep"
