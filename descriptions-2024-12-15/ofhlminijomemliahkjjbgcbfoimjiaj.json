If detection in Video not needed, then update settings anytime accordingly.\n\n\nIn todayâ€™s digital landscape, one of the greatest challenges we face is unexpectedly encountering haram and non-mahram content in images and videos. Whether browsing social media, news portals, watching documentaries, tutorials, or simply surfing the web, non-mahram content can appear anywhere. According to Islamic teachings, gazing upon non-mahram is strictly haram, yet we often forget this as the digital age makes it difficult to avoid.\n\nBy the grace of AllahðŸ’š, we have developed the worldâ€™s first advanced AI solution. This cutting-edge technology automatically blurs haram objects in real-time, protecting you and your family from unwelcome content in videos and images. As students, we have funded this project from our own, dedicating over a year to research, data collection, data annotation, model training, developing both the computer app and extension version and repeated testing.\n\nThis project is very expensive due to its advanced AI capabilities. To further improve this project, we need your support. We are committed to building a Halal Digital Environment using state-of-the-art technology to protect our present ummah and future generations. We have many ongoing projects that will empower you. Will you support us in this Halal technology revolution?
