Do you find yourself your reading speed (or capacity) isn’t good enough? We were having a same problem when it comes to reading all kinds of texts online (stock market news, Medium, tech blogs, papers…etc.) Those plain texts were refraining us from focus-read, eventually read only titles and slip away.  \n- Why can’t we read a blog that’s full of texts but valuable information immersive enough?  \n- Why can’t we read better with current english skills?  \n- Why can’t we focus more and make ourself easy to read those texts?  \n- Why can’t we remember i read and encode it easily to a long-term-memory?  \n\nWith help of Ai technology *Aighlight* can ramp-up one's reading capacity to get more important data from the long, large texts with more focused state."
