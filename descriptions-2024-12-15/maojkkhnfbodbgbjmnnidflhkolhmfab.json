You can set time limits on mobile apps, but this experience hasn't been effectively brought over to web.\n\nTimeLimit allows you to add time limits to websites, and throughout the day, it tracks the number of times you've visited the website. If you pass the time limit on a site, you get to choose whether to extend by 15 minutes, ignore the limit for the day, or close the tab.\n\nTaking an explicit action should help you make better decisions on how to spend your time.\n\nQ: How do I add new websites to TimeLimit? How do I know how long I've spent on those sites?\nA: Click the TimeLimit chrome extension icon to pop up a view that allows you to add/edit/remove websites to track, as well as modify how long your time limit is for that site. You can also use that extension popup to track your time spent on websites and visit history.\n\n- Zain Rehmani (zmrehmani@gmail.com)"
