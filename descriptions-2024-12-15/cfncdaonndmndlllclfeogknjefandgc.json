This allows the list to be sorted by actual combined primary offense statistics.\n-Adds Player Potential/Player Actual ratings to the draft page to allow the draft lists to be sorted by the big 4/5 primary offense and pitching statistics.\n\nFuture planned enhancements:\n-Allow user to pick which statistics to summarize.\n-Allow weighting of statistics to allow sorting of the list by a player profile. Ex: sort by player Glove+Arm+End rating when you need a catcher.\n\nIf you're inclined to support the ongoing development of PWTK, you can donate here: https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=J8X96XCG25M6E"
