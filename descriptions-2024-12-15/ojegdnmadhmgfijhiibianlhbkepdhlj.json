As of v2.0.0 the extension is purposely split into a Browser Extension with minimal functionality and a Web Extension that does the rest as described below. The Browser Extension will load a Web Extension of your choice, which in turn is also responsible for managing plugins. The recommended Web Extension comes with a default Plugin Manager. In order to load additional plugins, you can open the Plugin Manager by right-clicking a Blockly workspace and going into Options > Plugin Manager.\n\nFunctionality available:\n- Open Documentation\n- Copy to Clipboard\n- Paste from Clipboard\n- Add/Remove Comment\n- Show Inputs Vertically/Horizontally\n- Expand/Collapse Block\n- Expand/Collapse All Blocks\n- Add Blocks from the Context-menu\n- Toggle Distraction-Free Mode\n- Toggle Toolbox\n- Jump to Subroutine\n- Import/Export Blocks from/to JSON\n- Export Blocks to SVG[1] and PNG\n- Multiple selection by holding down SHIFT[2][3]:\n  - Drag selection as one\n  - Export selection to SVG[1] and PNG\n  - Copy/Paste selection to/from clipboard\n- Plugin system\n\n[1] The SVG still contains all other blocks, it is only focused on the selected portion! If you only intended to share a selection, copy/paste it to a clean workspace first.\n\n[2] CTRL is used by Blockly to detach a block when dragging, hence SHIFT was used.\n\n[3] Most actions from the context-menu do not support multiple selections yet and will only be performed on the last selected block."
