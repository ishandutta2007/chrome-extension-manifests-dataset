This is the process:\n\n1. Click the bear icon to load URSA into a new tab.\n2. Type the secret key into the top box. The recipient must know this key.\n3. Type your message, possibly containing rich formatting, images, and even files into the large box, then click Encrypt.\n\nThe recipient will decrypt the encrypted message, which can be sent by email or some other means without fear of its being decrypted, by typing the same key, pasting the encrypted message, and clicking Decrypt.\n\nIf you feel really paranoid, URSA can encrypt into a cover image, so that it cannot be detected that anything is there. The image looks the same after the secret data have been injected.\n\nURSA can also disguise its output so it appears to be normal text.\n\nIf you find yourself exchanging frequent messages with someone, you can switch into real-time chat, which can include text, files, audio, and even video!\n\nURSA's main encryption algorithm is XSalsa20, included within the NaCl encryption library. This algorithm has extensively been vetted by experts for over ten years without flaws being found. There are also two experimental algorithms: Pad, which uses a large piece of text (from a book, or a webpage) as key and is theoretically unbreakable, and Human, which can be performed by hand if necessary.\n\nURSA is fully compatible with PassLok Privacy, its larger sibling, also in this Web store. PassLok adds several asymmetric encryption modes, as well as secret splitting and digital signatures. There is also a web app at https://passlok.com/ursa\n\nYou can check the integrity of the web version of URSA with this data:\nCurrent version of URSA is: 4.3\n\nSHA256 of the single-file version, which can be downloaded from the above link:\n62ac-893d-a6df-edfc-dbd9-a849-5404-5b13-6701-d0da-87c2-8d0b-bc44-5153-742b-96b0\n\nSee the developer reading this on video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzTyfvgrHgc"
