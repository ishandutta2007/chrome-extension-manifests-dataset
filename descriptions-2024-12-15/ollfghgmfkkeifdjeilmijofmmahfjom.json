Reacting, liking, and sharing - without knowing if it's mutual? Time to light up your connections!\n\nðŸ‘ŒLinkedIn Engaging Network is a game-changing browser extension that helps you focus your efforts on relationships that truly get you results.\n\nðŸš€Features\n\nâœ…Uncover the full picture! See precisely how many mutual interactions you have with each connection.\n\nâœ…Discover at a glance who is truly engaged with your content and who deserves more of your attention.\n\nâœ…Get an accurate analysis of the ratio between the interactions you give and the ones you receive.\n\nâœ…Time-saving: Instead of acting randomly, manage your network wisely â€“ engage with those who engage with your posts through likes, shares and comments.\n\nâœ…Build a quality network: Nurture mutual and meaningful connections that will further your goals.\n\nâœ…Maintain a record of your latest 45 LinkedIn posts. The initial scan collects data from your last 15 posts, and subsequent scans update this information with new and modified content\n\nâœ…Maintain a record of your latest 300 comments and 300 likes. The initial scan collects data from your last 150 comments and 150 likes, and subsequent scans update this information with new comments and likes.\n\nðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡With LinkedIn Engaging Network, you don't just see - you understand.\nTurn every interaction into a measurement, every connection into a discernment, and every decision into a data-driven one. ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡\n\nInstall LinkedIn Engaging Network now and discover the true power of a mutual professional network!\n\nðŸš€How It Works\nWhen you hover over a name on LinkedIn, a small window will appear displaying the user's engagement rate with your posts and the number of engagements you've had with theirs. The tracked metrics include likes, comments, and reposts.\n\n\"%\" indicates the percentage of your posts that the user has engaged with.\n\n\n\nAfter installing the Engaging-Network browser extension, hover over any blue-marked username (indicating no known engagements with that user). In the small window that appears, click the 'Scan' button  located in the top right corner. Clicking this button is highly recommended, when it's highlighted with a red circle.\n\nWhen you click the 'Scan' button, a new tab will open. The extension will then begin scanning your LinkedIn account for any existing engagements.\n\nThe plugin solely scans your public LinkedIn profile, which is already visible to anyone online.\nYour data remains safe and secure, stored exclusively on your device, and never shared.\n\nThe initial scan may take a few minutes (usually less than 15). Afterward, the tool is ready to use.\n\nYou'll need to rescan every day or two, but these scans will be quick as they only scan updated and new posts, comments, and likes.\n\n\n\nLinkedIn user names are color-coded to indicate the level of engagement between you and them.\n\nðŸ”µBlue:   The user has not engaged with any of your posts, and you have not engaged with any of his/hers. Prior to first scan all users are marked with blue color.\n\nðŸŸ¢Green:   The user has engaged with at least 50% of your posts (e.g., liked, commented, or reposted).\n\nðŸŸ¡Yellow:   The user has engaged with at least 25% of your posts.\n\nðŸ”´Red:   The user has engaged with less than 25% of your posts, or you have engaged with his/her posts but he/she has not engaged with yours.\n\n\nReady to get started?
