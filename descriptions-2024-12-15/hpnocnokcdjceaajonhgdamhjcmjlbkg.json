By leveraging your EMRâ€™s native external credit card processing logic, you can map fields within your EMR to our extension, eliminating the tedious manual steps typically required.\n\nWhy Choose Our Extension?\nTraditionally, processing a payment involves manually opening your payment terminal, entering customer information, completing the payment, and then copying the authorization response back into your EMR. With our extension, all of this is handled automatically:\n\nField Mapping Made Simple: Use our intuitive field mapping tool to link your EMR fields to our extension.\nAutomation at Its Best: Our extension captures relevant information directly from your EMR, processes the payment securely, and automatically pastes the authorization message back into the appropriate EMR field.\nPre-Mapped Templates: New users can upload pre-saved mapping templates, allowing for a faster, easier setup.\nData We Access\nWe only access non-sensitive information to ensure seamless integration and functionality. This includes:\n\nMember ID: Helps associate EMR patients with saved customers in Das Payments.\nName, Phone Number, Email: Basic contact details for identifying patients.\nPurchase Amount: To process payments accurately.\nSecure Payment Processing\nAll payments are processed in our secure, PCI-compliant environment, ensuring that sensitive credit card information is never accessed or stored by the extension. We prioritize security at every step, so you can trust that your transactions are handled safely.\n\nCompatible EMRs\nOur extension is currently compatible with:\n\nNextGen\nModMed\nWebPT\nWhy We Need Permissions\nTo deliver these advanced features, our extension requires the following permissions:\n\nAccess to Specific Websites: We interact with EMR platforms like NextGen, ModMed, and WebPT to enable seamless integration.\nActive Tab and Web Navigation: These permissions allow us to detect and interact with the EMR pages where you perform credit card transactions.\nStorage: Saves your field mappings and preferences for future use.\nDownloads: Supports exporting and importing field mapping templates for easier setup.\nScripting: Injects scripts into the EMR pages to map fields and automate workflows.\nHow It Works\n\nMap Your Fields: Use our tool to connect EMR fields (e.g., patient ID, name, purchase amount) with Das Payments.\nAutomate Payments: When you process a transaction in your EMR, our extension securely handles the payment in the background.\nAuthorization Message: Automatically pastes the payment authorization details back into the appropriate EMR field.\nGet Started Today\nSimplify your payment workflow, save time, and reduce manual errors.
