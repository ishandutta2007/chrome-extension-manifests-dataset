Just setup a reminder with 'RemindMeLater' and quit worrying about forgetting or overlooking it.\n\n'RemindMeLater' is designed to be customizable (check out the options page) and works while Chrome is working.\n\nIt indicates the number of reminders you may have missed, below its icon, on your Google Chrome toolbar (at the side of the address bar). All reminders you create are stored on the machine you create them on.\n\nNote that this extension is currently in Beta.\nPlease report any bugs or share any suggestions for improvement you may have with us, using the options in the 'Details' or the 'Reviews' tab above.\n\nUpdates:\n* Using new notification mechanism (as Chrome has deprecated the createHTMLNotifications causing this to break).\n* Added option for disabling sound (i.e. only visual notification)."
