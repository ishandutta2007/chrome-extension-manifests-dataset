Trello actually includes card numbers but hides them by default.\n\nThis extension does the following:\n- Reveals card numbers on cards themselves\n- Reveals the card count for a given list\n- Adds a card number to a created card\n- Adds a card number head in the detail view\n- Allows you to make card numbers bold\n- Allows you to change the color of the card numbers\n- Optional \"Copy details\" button for copying number and card title\n\nThis project was based off the widely available bookmarklet for Trello numbers mentioned in their forum at https://trello.com/c/PkIrgKzd/36-show-card-numbers.\n\n******************\n## 2.3.0 (2017-10-27)\n- Fix bug where method is called on nil\n- Fix bug where number isn't added on card create\n- Add customizations to copy details button\n- Improve html/css around options box\n\nYou can add improvements or comments on github: https://github.com/dewyze/trello-card-numbers."
