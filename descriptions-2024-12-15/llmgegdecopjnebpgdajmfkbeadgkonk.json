If you’re looking to find someone to write an op-ed, speak at your conference, or consult with your business, you’ll find a bewildering number of purported “experts” floating about the AI ecosystem.\n\nHow can you tell who is qualified? Who actually knows something about the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, and who's simply pretending that they do? Who's pushing forward the latest advances in the technology, and who is merely riding the waves of media hype?\n\nThis extension dynamically modifies web pages to insert ratings of thought-leaders directly into the text of the sites. Verify™ leverages the public Certified AI Thought-Leader (CAT-L) database to insert certification badges—corresponding to live ratings of thought-leaders in the AI ecosystem—in context, anywhere on the web. Importantly, badges are only inserted into pages containing claims made about artificial intelligence and machine learning. The Verify™ software will not display ratings for thought-leaders who appear in the CAT-L database when these individuals comment publicly on or otherwise receive coverage in fields other than AI.\n\nVerify™ is a free product of Certified Artificial, an AI standards firm. Certified Artificial offers certification services for corporate and individual clients. In the case of the CAT-L designation, for a nominal certification fee, Certified Artificial’s team of experts conduct a rigorous 50-point inspection and assign a CAT-L Gold, CAT-L Silver, or CAT-L Bronze credential—or, indeed, a “Do Not Recommend” rating—to thought-leaders in artificial intelligence. On a case-by-case basis, the Certified Artificial team also proactively assigns certifications to specific experts in the space.\n\nLearn more at https://certifiedartificial.com."
