The addon will remain available for download as long as the store allows, and the source on gitlab (https://gitlab.com/Marnes-group/webextensions) will also remain available to fork.\n**I do have a greasyfork account (https://greasyfork.org/en/users/18593-marnes) and may publish works there in the future.** I have mild intentions to reimplement the core functionality of CSL, IBCP, and DID as public userscripts.\n\nAlso available for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-selected-links/\n\nWhen you select text in a page and your selection contains links, you can right-click anywhere on the selection or use a hotkey to copy the URLs of all those links at once.\n\nPlease check the linked homepage for more complete information. Issues can be filed on the linked support site."
