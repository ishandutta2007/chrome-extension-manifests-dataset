All the uploaded files will be listed in the UI. You can now click on the - Zip & Download - button to download the ZIP file to your system (default download location). There is also a reload button at the top-right corner in the app UI. Clicking on this button will reload the app and reset all active operations. If you want to zip multiple files, please drag & drop them altogether in the app (top section). It is also recommended to reload the UI after each zip operation.\n\nNote 1: this add-on is only designed to make compressed zip files. If you want to extract a zip folder (unzip), please install my other add-on: ZIP Reader (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zip-reader/hppjaadfhhgadeokjndmbnjnegagcadd)\n\nNote 2: this add-on is using an open-source JavaScript library for the zip operation. You can get more info about this library here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js\n\nIf you found a bug to report, or have a feature request, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/zip-maker.html)."
