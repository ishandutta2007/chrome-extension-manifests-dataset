Facts include famous births and deaths, important historical events in the course of history, triumphant sporting occurrences, breakthrough discoveries, revolutionary laws being passed and overturned, and many more. Have an interesting and engaging conversation starter wherever you are, every single day! Every time you open a new tab, the default new tab will show you a new fact - no need to click the extension in the upper right corner. \n\nThis lightweight extension is very non-intrusive - it sits as an icon in the top right corner of your browser and shows a new fact with a click of the mouse.  You can also scroll forward and back in day, as well as scroll through all the same facts for the same day.\n\nFor the more tech-savy, I have ensured that all users get the same facts shown, in the same same randomly shuffled order, using the current day as the seed for shuffling.  Refer to code for details.\n\nKnow what happened today, give this extension a try!\n\nI am interested in all feedback, positive and negative.
