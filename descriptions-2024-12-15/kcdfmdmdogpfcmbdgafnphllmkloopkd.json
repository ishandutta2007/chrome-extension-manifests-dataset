There are countless occurrences where Youtube videos lure users in with eye catching titles and thumbnails, the next thing they know, half the day has passed. There are several workarounds to saving time already, such as watching the video on double speed, however this only reduces the watch time by half. \n\nThis is where QuickTube comes in, by summarizing the captions or transcript of any given video, it is able to pull the most important information and condense it into a small paragraph, reading this paragraph would take a tiny fraction of the total length of the video, while still providing the most important points to the user.\n\nNo more getting sidetracked by eye catching videos, summarize them and get back to work."
