It can involve a lot of outreach that often goes nowhere.\n\nAffirmative identifies websites with existing affiliate and social links.\n\nWhen a content creator is actively participating as an affiliate to monetize content, this can mean a shorter recruitment funnel and time to activation as a new recruit for your own affiliate program.\n\nAffirmative operates in the background to scan the webpage on the current tab for affiliate links and social media contacts. These links are aggregated for display when the extension popup is activated. When possible, the affiliate ids and social handles for each network are extracted and available in the summary as well.\n\nThe current release scans for links from the most popular affiliate platforms and social media networks. To see the full set of detected links, please visit our website."
