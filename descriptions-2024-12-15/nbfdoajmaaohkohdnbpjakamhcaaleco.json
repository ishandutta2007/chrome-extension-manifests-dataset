Reddit won‚Äôt let you bulk delete your data so this extension lets you mass delete your Reddit comments, posts, and messages. It gives you 4 simple buttons ‚Äî Delete comments, Delete posts, Delete both comments and posts, or Delete messages ‚Äî that automatically delete your Reddit content in one go.\n\nüåü ‚ÄúWorth the money! I deleted everything in about 15 minutes. Thanks. Exactly as advertised.‚Äù ‚Äì Reviewer. \n\nAfter you install the extension, a screen with deletion options will appear. A confirmation screen is shown before the deleting process starts. Then just leave the browser tab open and let it work. Unlike a script, it deletes everything automatically.\n\nBy default, there is a limit of 50 deletions per day. For a small one-time payment that buys lifetime access to the extension on any browser, you can delete without any limits. This is to make the extension worthwhile to update and maintain. Some people don‚Äôt realize the amount of work that goes into extensions and think everything should be free. Making good extensions is hard work and requires compensation!  We hope you'll understand. ü•∫\n\nNote: this extension does not read, store, or transmit your Reddit or other browsing data in any form. The extension needs permission to access extensionpay.com to manage your paid features, but no information is shared with this site.\n\nChrome version: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bulk-delete-reddit-posts/nbfdoajmaaohkohdnbpjakamhcaaleco?hl=en&authuser=0 \nFirefox version: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bulk-delete-reddit-history/\nEdge version: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/bulk-delete-reddit-posts-/aadcpdagapcmcpjainhaejocmlpjniid \n\nChangelog:\n\nv3.2: This version adds a fix for Chrome v130 which introduced a bug causing the extension not to work at all.\nv3.1: Small rate limit tweaks to prevent 429 errors from Reddit. Let me know if you‚Äôre still getting them.\nv3.0: Even more robust rate limit (aka 429) detection and avoidance (mostly for users with very fast internet connections).\nv2.9: Increased time between deleting to hopefully fix 429 errors some users are seeing temporarily.\nv2.8: Fixed bug where extension wouldn‚Äôt re-open automatically after payment.\nv2.7: Fix a bug where payment page didn‚Äôt open properly and opened a 404 page instead.\nv2.6: Upgrade payment page to allow more payment methods, more secure checkout with Stripe.\nv2.5: More secure deletion method.\nv2.4: Fixed a bug in Firefox that caused paid functionality not to work.\nv2.3: Added links to delete ‚Äútop‚Äù and ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù posts after ‚Äúall‚Äù posts are deleted because Reddit treats these differently for some reason.\nv2.2: Added ‚ÄúDelete messages‚Äù button that deletes all messages you‚Äôve received.\nv2.1: Added support for deleting ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù comments, which Reddit separates from ‚Äúall‚Äù comments for some reason.\nv2.0: Minor text change to make things clearer.\nv1.9: Fixed an error introduced in v1.8 that only deleted ‚Äútop‚Äù comments and not ‚Äúall‚Äù. Now, by default, ‚Äúall‚Äù comments are deleted first and after that there‚Äôs a button that can open the ‚Äútop‚Äù comments page for further deletion.\nv1.8: Finally fixed a bug that a small number of users were getting where ‚Äútop‚Äù comments weren‚Äôt being deleted. Now all comments should be deleted correctly for all users.\nv1.6-1.7: Minor improvements to usability, including a bug which caused the extension to open unexpectedly after updates.\nv1.5: Fixed a bug for Firefox that caused the extension to not work after paying. Also network errors are now detected.\nv1.2-1.4: After payment, the extension will now refresh immediately to show you‚Äôve paid.\nv1.1: Fixed a bug that halted deletion after just one page. Now all comments and posts are deleted fully without needing to restart the process.\n\nPlease consider leaving a review! Many reviewers try the extension once, there's a bug, they leave a bad review, the extension is fixed in response, and then they never update their review, leaving other potential users with a mistaken impression. Your review would help correct this which would help many people, including me. There are a lot of haters out there! Be a lover instead! Thanks!"
