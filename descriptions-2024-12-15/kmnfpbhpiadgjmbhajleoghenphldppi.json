Getting frustrated sorting through endless irrelevant websites and irrelevant pop-up sites just to find that one article you viewed roughly two weeks ago? \n\nIntroducing TimeTrace — your personalized database designed to help you navigate your browsing history like never before.\n\nTimeTrace is a web extension that presents all of your browser history as an intuitive and informative timeline. Our extension not only allows you to see exactly how much time you’ve spent on each website and better understand your browsing habits, but it also allows you to search for the content of any site you've browsed. \n\n______________________________________________\n\nFeatures include:\n- A powerful search bar that allows you to search browsed website content in addition to site title and URL.\n- A continuous timeline that shows all browser activity and time spent on each website.\n- Timeline automatically folds URLs from the same domain together, with the option of hiding irrelevant browsing activity (hide sites visited for less than 5s).\n- Easily go to any day that has browsing history and view your timeline.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nUpcoming features:\n\nWe are currently working on automatic AI summaries for timeline events.\n\nIn the near future, we will be offering an AI co-pilot that helps you find any content on any website you’ve ever browsed using TimeTrace.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nData privacy:\n\nTimeTrace does not store any user personal information. All user data are stored locally.
