When users surf the web, they can immediately see sites and services connected to Russian Federation.\nThe extension also has a social significance â€” users can determine which sites or media connect to Russian servers and inform them about it so they can fix the problem. Many media outlets are unaware that their sites connection to Russian servers.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIn July 2016, Russia enforced Federal bills No. 374-FZ and 375-FZ. The bill requires telecom providers to store the content of voice calls, data, images, and text messages on Russian servers for 6 months, and their metadata (e.g., time, location, message sender, and recipients) for 3 years. Online services such as messengers, emails, and social networks that use encrypted data are required to permit the Federal Security Service (FSB) to access and read their encrypted communications."
