This was separate from Google News results (which are collected from verified publishers), but instead promoted whatever #content was particularly clicky and happened to match the user's search phrase.\n\nSometimes these stories were wrong, or outright fake. For a few weeks after the 2016 election, searching \"2016 popular vote\" would hand you a fake news article (falsely) declaring Donald Trump the popular winner. Searching \"aliens\" returned a story about how extraterrestrials had be caught on camera \"sucking energy from the sun.\"\n\nGoogle has since changed the name of the section to \"Top stories,\" but that still isn't precise enough. This extension replaces that title with one of several more accurate options."
