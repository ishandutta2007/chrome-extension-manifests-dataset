Anchor Vault is a plugin wallet for Ethereum that combines both account abstraction (ERC-4337) and Pauli Groupâ€™s quantum resistant LAMB technology (Lamport Messaging on Blockchains) to future-proof all your assets on the blockchain!\nUpgrade once and rest easy, no existing or future supercomputer can break your keys.\nThe wallet supports both one-time use of ECDSA and Lamport signatures. Small transactions are safe and cheap with ECDSA and all accounts are future proof for decades with Lamport as a cryptographic bedrock.\nSecure all your NFTs! Anchor Vault supports the ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 token standard.\n\nFirst use:\n1. Create your account\n2. Deploy your wallet on chain by committing to quantum resistant keys (the first deployment involves a one-time service fee)\n3. Encrypt and backup your account\n4. Your digital assets are now future proof\n\nThe product is under active development and we welcome all feedback as we add features to enhance the user experience and extend the quantum resistance coverage to more digital assets and ledgers."
