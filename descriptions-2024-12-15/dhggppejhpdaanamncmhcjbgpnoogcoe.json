So far it DISABLES the ability to upvote / downvote, so INSTALL WITH CARE.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you have a problem with the plugin, please file an issue under https://github.com/bersling/stackoverflow-order-by-votes-chrome-plugin/issues before giving it a bad review!\n\nWithout this plugin, the accepted answer is pinned to the top. Often however, the accepted answer is a legacy solution but there's no-one there to change the accepted answer to a newer answer. In other cases, the asker is just too kind and awards accepted answer to the first person that gives a semi-decent answer.\n\nThe issues are discussed in https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/326095/please-unpin-the-accepted-answer-from-the-top , but there isn't a prompt solution in sight. Until then, I hope to alleviate some of the pain with this plugin.\n\nThe code for this plugin is visible at https://github.com/bersling/stackoverflow-order-by-votes-chrome-plugin.\n\nCompatibility Notice: You need to deactivate uBlock origin or similar other chrome plugins on StackOverflow for the plugin to work properly."
