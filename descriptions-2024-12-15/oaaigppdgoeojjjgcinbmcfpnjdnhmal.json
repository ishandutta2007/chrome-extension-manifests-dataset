Many online scams use copies of famous websites to scam people. This is especially true in areas such as NFTs, housing scams and postal package scams. Most of these scams could be avoided, however this requires extreme care and attention to detail. This is why even people who are particularly familiar with the web and the internet world can still fall for these scams and this is normal, as they are often very well thought out.\nThis is why we have decided to bring a new solution.\n\nNamely URL Checker\n\nOur chrome extension aims to authenticate the URLs of the sites you visit in order to warn you if you find yourself on a fraudulent site. \n\nAnd nothing more.\n\nWe do not collect any data.\n\nWe have no ambition to tell people where they should or should not go.\n\nWe do not want to order or direct you.\n\nOur only ambition is to be an advisor who simply warns you.\n \nJust think of URL Checker as a little ally on your side that prevents you from being fooled by the web.\n\nWe want to be a tool to help make the web a safer place. To let creators, artists, innovators, business people and so on.\n\nA safer place for them and their community to express their ideas and work. \n\nURL Checker."
