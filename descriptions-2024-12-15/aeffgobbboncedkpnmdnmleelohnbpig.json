Have you ever had an overwhelming amount of tabs open - cluttering your browser - which were necessary for a project, but were not needed at the present moment? Simply save the state, de-clutter your session, and then re-open them again whenever you wish at the click of a button! If you have Sync turned on for your Google account, these states can transfer across computers as well, making it as easy as a button click to transfer tabs from one computer to another!"
