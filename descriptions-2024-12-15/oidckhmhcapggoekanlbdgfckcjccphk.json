Just supply gata with a URL, define some variables, and you're done!\n\nExamples include:\n- Going to a Twitter profile\n- Jumping to a specific repository on Github\n- Viewing your favourite Reddit, sorted how you choose\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nTo create a shortcut to go to a Twitter profile, we'll provide the URL \"https://twitter.com/%s\"\n\nThe \"%s\" signifies a variable. This is the part that you are going to fill in when you access the shortcut.\n\nWhen you go to use this shortcut, gata will prompt you to enter the username you want to access and take you there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Keyboard navigation - access all your shortcuts without using your mouse\n- Syncing - your shortcuts are synced across Chrome browsers that are signed in with the same account\n\nOPEN SOURCE\n\nThe code for this project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/evansalter/gata, where the code can be viewed and contributed to.
