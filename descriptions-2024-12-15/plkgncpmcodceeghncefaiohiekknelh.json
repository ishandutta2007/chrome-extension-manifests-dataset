Once the interface is shown you will see a popup with 4 different sections. On the top, there is a toolbar with a few buttons. In the middle, there is a big icon (color-palette icon) that can be used to render the native color picker UI. Click on this icon to pick a new color. Please note that, depending on your browser and OS, the native color picker UI may vary significantly. Once you chose a color, the table on the right-side will be updated with color values in six different formats. For the first time when you open the color picker UI, please click on the - Basic colors - section once, otherwise the addon will not be able to select and save your color. At the bottom of the UI, you will see a table with all the selected colors in solid circles. If you click on a circle, the current color will change to the selected circle color. Moreover, if you want to delete all circles, pleased press the - Clear History - button at the top-left corner of the interface. Below the clear button, there are color-chooser and eye-dropper (see below) buttons. At the top-right corner, there are reload (to reload the interface), support, and donation buttons.\n\nNote: the extension has a new feature called eye-dropper. With this new feature, you can inspect colors all over your screen, even in the areas outside of the browser. EyeDropper API is still experimental and available only in modern browsers.\n\nNote: to report bugs, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/color-picker.html)."
