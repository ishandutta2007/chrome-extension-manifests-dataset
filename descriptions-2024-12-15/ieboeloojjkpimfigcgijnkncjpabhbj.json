Password managers can do this because they can see everything on that page, including all your precious private information. In fact, most extensions and add-ons installed on your browser can do it. Feeling better now?\n\nNow, you can open the page in incognito mode, which by default blocks all extensions from loading, but if you have allowed some extensions to load in this mode, it's rather tedious to go one by one making sure they are safe.\n\nPage Cage protects your private pages from intrusion by loading them inside a frame to which the other extensions do not have access. It's as simple as clicking the Page Cage icon and typing the URL.\n\nSince this is quite a neat to prevent from intrusion my encryption and security web apps, starting with version 1.0 there is a nifty list that allow you to load them without having to remember their URL.\n\nNot all pages will load, however, because many websites refuse to be placed inside a frame in order to prevent Clickjacking. This comes from the server so there's nothing that we can do about it. Please bear this in mind as you use Page Cage."
