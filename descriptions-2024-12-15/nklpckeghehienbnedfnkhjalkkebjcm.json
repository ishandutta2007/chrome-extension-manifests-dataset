We have built the extension to ensure that it contains no personally identifying information and have removed extension analytics. This extension will change your default search provider, homepage, and new tab settings to direct you to a Dogpile private experience. Only searches established through this extension will be private.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a single purpose extension. This is not a proxy server. It does not locally hide your search history. Sites you visit from our search engine results page may log your usage per their site terms and conditions. Further, if requested by court order, records or logs will be made available, to law enforcement and investigative agencies."
