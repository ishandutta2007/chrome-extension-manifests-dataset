To address this, we have created a solution that seamlessly integrates with the updated JIRA environment. Our extension allows for adding information from GitHub pull request (PR) labels directly into JIRA tickets in sprint view. This allows teams to easily track the progress of PRs, identify who needs to take action next, and identify bottlenecks, ensuring a smoother, more efficient project management experience.\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\nAfter installing the extension, follow these steps to integrate it with GitHub:\n\n1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens\n2. Click `Generate New Token` -> `Generate New Token (classic)` \n3. Re-enter your password\n4. Give your token a description (e.g. LabelSync for JIRA)\n5. Please tick the only `repo` checkbox in `Select scopes` panel\n6. Click `Generate Token`\n7. If you have Single sign-on (SSO), ensure to authorize the organization\n8. Copy the generated token\n9. In the extension panel click `Details` button and then click the `Extension options` item\n10. Paste the token to the `Github Access Token` field \n11. Click `Save` and you are done! Your GitHub integration is now seamlessly configured"
