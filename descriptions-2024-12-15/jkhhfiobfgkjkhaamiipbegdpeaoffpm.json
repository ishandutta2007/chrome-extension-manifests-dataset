It finds all the wikipedia.org/... links in your current tab and converts them to 0wikipedia.org/... links. That's all there is to it. \n\nThis extension actually helps you 'obey' the ban in your country by replacing 'unsafe' website links with 'safe' website links. Until they are banned too ofcourse. \n\nThis will only work if you click a link for wikipedia.org. Meaning, it won't redirect you if you enter wikipedia.org/... link directly in your search bar. I may add that feature in the future. Also it may not work on some dynamically generated links too. I only tested this in Turkey, I don't know how other countries ban wkipedia but I assume it's the same. Send me a feedback if it doesn't work in your country, I may find a way for your country too.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I'm not related to wikipedia.org or 0wikipedia.org nor wiki-zero.net. I developed this extension because I was frustrated with VPN or having to enter 0 every time I wanted to go to wikipedia.org."
