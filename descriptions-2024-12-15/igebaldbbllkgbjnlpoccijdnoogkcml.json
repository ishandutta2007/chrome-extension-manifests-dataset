On websites where identification is solely based on your username or social medias where your username usually is similar to your real name, using a consistent username makes sense. However, on sites like Discord or Kahoot, creating new and wacky usernames every day is part of the fun!\n\nBandNames is a tool that helps you come up with hilarious, frequently-changing usernames with just a few presses of a button! There is no true definition for what makes a good band name. Typically, any ridiculous pairing of an adjective and noun works well, but there are so many other good possibilities!\n\nNames can be generated from a pre-written list or at random from a noun and an adjective. Switching between these modes is a single button press and each has a different interface that makes it easy to adhere to length requirements, generate all or half of the current suggested name, and copy the current suggestion to the clipboard.\n\nPin the extension to easily open the popup from the icon in the top right of the browser. You can also specify website URLs that should automatically open the popup for you in a new, miniature window! Head to manage extensions -> BandNames -> options to add new URLs to the list. Only want this popup to open on specific places on the website? You can do that! Any URL added to the list is checked against the current URL when you navigate to a new page. If the list item appears anywhere in the full URL and route, it will open the popup. Make that list item more specific to only open at certain routes and sub-routes, or leave it as the domain to be more general!\n\nThis project is open sourced: https://github.com/ElijahMSmith/BandNames.\n\nWhat's new in version 1.0.2:\n- Lots of fixes.\n- Revamped name selection code to avoid future and current issues."
