Put your cart to better use.\n\nHow does the app work?\nWhen you go to check out on your favorite shopping site, we’ll not-so-subtly remind you to consider donating instead to one of a couple highly effective charities by letting you know how much good your money can do.\n\nWhat if I'm buying essentials?\nNo judgement here.  Even for those who can afford it, we know it's not realistic to donate instead of buying most times you shop.  All we ask is that the next time you go to check out with a squirrel hand puppet in your cart, you'll consider putting those dollars to better use.  \n\nWhy so few charity options?\nNot all charities are created equal.  We base our featured selections off of the extensive research of organizations like GiveWell and The Life You Can Save who recommend only charities that have a proven track record of doing the most good for your buck.   \n\nWhich shopping sites does the app work on?\nRight now just Amazon, but we're working on adding more."
