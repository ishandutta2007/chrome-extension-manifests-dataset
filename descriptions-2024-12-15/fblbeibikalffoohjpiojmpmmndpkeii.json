It supports UK and US English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Chinese, Indonesian, Polish and Russian. Additional voices may be available depending on your system, and you can install more voices from the Chrome Web Store.\n\nClaroSpeak can support proofing and editing by people of all abilities: it is easier to hear a mistake than read it. But it is of especial use in schools, colleges, universities and elsewhere in education for people with print impairments, such as dyslexia. The ability to change the font (typeface), font size, background colour and text colour can be help to people with Irlen Syndrome or with sight problems (visual impairment or blindness) by reducing or increasing the contrast."
