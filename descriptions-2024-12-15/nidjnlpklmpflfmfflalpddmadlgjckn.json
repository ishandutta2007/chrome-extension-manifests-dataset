With IceLink, WebRTC Anywhere becomes a reality, and you can begin developing applications today that make use of peer-to-peer audio, video, and data streaming regardless of the browsers or platforms involved.\n\nUsing IceLink’s cross-platform API ensures that your applications are portable across all platforms. The API makes use of existing WebRTC support when available (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and provides the same support everywhere else (Internet Explorer and numerous native platforms). Since IceLink adheres strictly to the WebRTC standard, applications written using other WebRTC implementations interact seamlessly with applications using IceLink. IceLink also includes simple API support for establishing “many-to-many” peer-to-peer connections.\n\nThis extension allows WebRTC connections to use the screen as a video source."
