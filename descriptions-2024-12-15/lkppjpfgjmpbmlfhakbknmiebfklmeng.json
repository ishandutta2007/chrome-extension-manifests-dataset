Check what the term means by hovering over an underlined term. A description will pop up in a couple of seconds.\n\n-Right-Click Search\n     On any website, highlight a term, right-click it and choose \"Search Wikipedia for ...\"\n\n-Omnibox Search\n     Use the keyword \"w\". It's simple, type 'w' then a space (or tab) followed by your term to search.\n\nWhy Easy Wikipedia?\n     Well, I don't have ads. I didn't like them and I'm not doing this for money, but instead for fun and learning. (I'm a Computer Science major after all)\n     I personally use it to quickly understand technical words in articles I'm researching for school.\n     This would be a great default addition for schools/businesses who use Wikipedia regularly!\n\n\n>> Update 0.8.4.1\n- Update link selection criteria.\n>> Update 0.8.4\n- Added How-To, and contact links.\n>> Update 0.8.3\n- Stops the entire page from scrolling when you scroll within the popup.\n>> Update 0.9\n- Added right-click search, and Omnibox keyword \"w\" search"
