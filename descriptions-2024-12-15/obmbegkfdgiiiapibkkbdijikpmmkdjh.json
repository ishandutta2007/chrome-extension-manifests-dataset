Directly from any e-commerce platform, marketplace or website. It is our ambition to simplify shipping in such a way so that anyone can do it fast, regardless of company size, IT knowledge or infrastructure.\n\nThis extension will allow you to quickly transform a company name or address into a shipping label for all major carriers, from any webpage. Easily connect to carriers such as Spring UK, Hermes and more.\n\nIt works with any platform and any website, since it allows you to create your own mapping if your platform is not yet mapped straight out of the box. Will work anywhere Chrome works.\n\nThis extension offers two key features:\n- Automatically detects addresses from popular e-commerce platforms like Magento, Shopify, Amazon, eBay and more. For other platforms, addresses only have to be mapped to the right address fields once. After this addresses are automatically detected from these pages as well.\n- Right click a company name or address and our extension will look up the address in Google and autofill all of the found information. Add any missing information and get shipping labels in only a few seconds.\n\nWould you like to know more? Are we missing support for your webshop platform? Would you like to use other carriers? Want to help us further improve this extension with suggestions? Or just want to say hi? Let us know at custserv.glm@spring-gds.com\nHope to hear from you soon!"
