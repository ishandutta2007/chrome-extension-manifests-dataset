It is kept online for pure reference.\n\nMCAST Attendance Helper is meant to be used by lecturers at The Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology. Works in basic mode by default and in advanced mode if configured.\n\nBasic Mode: Adds a new button that counts the number or students marked as present. \n\nAdvanced Mode: Adds Autofill & Remember functionalities. Autofill Attendance is a link that automatically fills Class, Unit, Session & Duration if the attendance is being added during the lesson (day and time match). Remember allows the lecturer to save the state of attendance (Absent/Present, Reason & Remark for each student) and to automatically set them again thereafter.\n\nSources can be found on github.com/robert-abela/mcast-attendance-extension.
