It is especially useful for neurodivergent population, e.g. with ADHD and ADD.\n\nEye Read uses a custom algorithm that bolds a portion of each word to help guide your eyes over the text. This augmented reading technique enables your brain to autocomplete the words, which translates into improved focus and faster reading. \n\nKey features:\n⭐️ Simple to use - designed to be intuitive and work out of the box.\n⭐️ Lightweight and fast - doesn't slow down your web browsing experience or break pages.\n⭐️ Customizable - noise level control allows you to adjust how much content to highlight on the page.\n⭐️ Works where it matters - keep using M365 Office Suite apps, such as Word or PowerPoint, browse social media apps, or read books in Google Play Books. \n⭐️ Does not collect any personal data"
