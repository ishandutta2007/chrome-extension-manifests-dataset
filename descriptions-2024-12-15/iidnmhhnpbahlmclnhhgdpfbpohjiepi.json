Go to www.preveil.com to download the desktop app before installing the extension.\n\nWith PreVeil for Gmail, users can now easily send and receive encrypted email right inside their Gmail window; using their existing email address. Only you and your recipients can decrypt and see messages, no one else, not Google, not even PreVeil.\n\nFirst Install the PreVeil desktop application, then add the PreVeil Gmail browser extension. Messages are now automatically encrypted end to end, so there’s no way for users to forget to encrypt an email. And you don’t need any special passcode or password to send orre receive secure email. \n\nFor business users, PreVeil’s SaaS-based, cloud service is also easy to manage. Admins don’t have to provision any servers, databases, or manage any certificates. \n\nFor regulated environments, Gmail does not comply with many industry compliance requirements for data security; PreVeil gives those companies a low-cost easy to manage alternative without business disruption.\n\nFinally, an encrypted email and file sharing solution that both admins and users will love to use.\nCybersecurity experts agree that the best way to protect information is to encrypt it in transit and at rest. But existing systems make encryption a real challenge because they’re a pain for users and a burden for admins. PreVeil changes all that.\n\nUsers are frustrated by having to go to special websites or use phone calls to obtain codes to decrypt messages or by having to remember complex passwords. With PreVeil there are no codes or passwords to be forgotten, lost or stolen; so even if your Gmail account password is compromised, it can’t be used to read your encrypted emails.\n\nAnd it also works on mobile devices. Install PreVeil for Android or iOS to easily extend message and data security to your mobile devices too.\n\nEncryption today is also challenging for admins. They have to support and manage the complexity of keys, and certificates, and passcodes, for the whole organization plus anyone else their employees are doing business with. As a result, the benefits of encryption are often bypassed in enterprises because current solutions are just too cumbersome to use in the real world.\n\nContact us and learn more at www.preveil.com"
