Sometimes, if you are aware of those mistakes, you can immediately correct them, but it takes time and your time is precious. \n\nThis extension is built to help you save your precious time by recommending you potential corrections of your mistype in the autocomplete of your Chrome browser’s address bar.\n\nHow does it work? Fairly simple. You type in the address bar a search term. When we detect a potential mistype, we will provide you a clickable reminder in the autocomplete. If you recognize the mistake and accept our recommendation, just click on it and we will take you to the result page of the correct spelling of your search query.\n\nWe provide a list of common mistakes that people make when they type inside this extension’s user interface to help you understand how it works better in action.\n\nPermissions used and reasons:\n\n1. Access to “cookies” (optional). We require this permission to customize and modify your search engine as well as to keep autocomplete default suggestions. It’s optional because if you don’t allow permission to use cookies, we will not need it. Once after you grant permission to use cookies, you can always revoke it at any time. \n2. Change your default search engine to our private domain secured-browse.net powered by Yahoo. We require this permission to use our search domain as a placeholder and to provide you the functionality in the autocomplete suggestions of your address bar. Inside this extension, we support Yahoo, Google, and Bing. You can switch to a different provider at any time inside the Settings section.\n3.Access to \"storage\". We require this permission to save your settings within the extension.\n\nHow to remove this extension?\n\nIf you want to remove our extension, go to “Settings” on Chrome, and find our extension in the “Extensions” tab. Click “remove”. Alternatively, you can right-click on the extension’s icon on your browser and select “Uninstall” from the drop-down menu.\n\nChrome™  is a trademark of Google LLC.
