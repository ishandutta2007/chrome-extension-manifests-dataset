'Chrome-Variable' is a chrome extension that allows you to define variables for text in chrome and reuse them anywhere at any time.\n\nNever leave the browser for retrieving information ever again! \n\nHow to use Chrome Variable:\n\n1) Click the extension icon to access 'Chrome Variable.' \n2) Use the form displayed to store variables. \n3) In order to use the variable, simply go on any web page with a form, type \"<variable-name>\", followed by a period.\n4) As soon as you enter the period, the variable name will be replaced by the value you set.\n\nNotes:\n- You can enter the period after any number of variables. \n- Make sure to wrap your variables in the\"<>\" tag.\n\nWhile the replace variable feature might not work on every website, Chrome Variable allows you to access variables and copy them to clipboard right from the home screen. You really never have to leave your browser for retrieving information ever again!\n\nWe are constantly working to improve Chrome Variable. If you have any suggestions or feature requests, feel free to create an issue on our Github repository.\n\nhttps://github.com/shafinsiddique/chrome-variable."
