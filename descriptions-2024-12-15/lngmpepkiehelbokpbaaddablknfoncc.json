The latest version also lets you choose other languages as well as Wikia sites. Let us know if you want other languages or other wikias added!\n\nLearn something new, discover an interesting fact, or find out just how many articles Wikipedia actually has about Euro Football.\n\nPerhaps you are wondering \"can't I just change my homepage?\". This is better: It caches a few pages in the background, so you don't have to wait for it to load and can get on with your new-tab-ish business.\n\nThis plugin is open source.
