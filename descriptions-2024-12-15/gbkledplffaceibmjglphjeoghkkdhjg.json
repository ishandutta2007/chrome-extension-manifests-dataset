With over 19 million products in our database, goodbuy ensures you get exactly what you need, the moment you need it, (and BONUS!) it’ll be from a values-aligned small business. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: goodbuy does not read, track, or store any financial information. We only pop-up when you’re searching for a product and we can provide you with awesome options from small businesses.\n\nSo, how does the goodbuy browser extension actually work after you add it to chrome? \n\n1. Say you need a water bottle (or any other product from any other category).\n\n2. You go online, to whatever retailer or search engine you always go to, and search for the water bottle. \n\n3. The goodbuy widget pops up showing you that exact same water bottle (or very similar) from a small, values-aligned business. \n\n4. Click the product, add to cart, and applause––you’ve made a goodbuy! \n\nYou’ve got a product you need. We’ve got the small business you want to buy it from… Faster that you can say “add to cart”!\n\nWe’re on a mission to make shopping feel good by making conscious shopping easy. \n\nShop small. Shop easily. Shop what matters to you. Discover over 185,000 small businesses and over 19 million products!"
