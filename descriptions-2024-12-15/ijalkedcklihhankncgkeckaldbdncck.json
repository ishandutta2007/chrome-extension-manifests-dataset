Additionally, squares that result in stalemate or checkmate are highlighted.\n\n    ðŸ”¹ Highlight All Attacking & Defending Pieces\n        Select (right-click) any square on the board to highlight its attackers and defenders.\n\n    ðŸ”¹ Evaluation Bar (still testing)\n        Intended as a feature to give players hints in case they are missing something very obvious.
