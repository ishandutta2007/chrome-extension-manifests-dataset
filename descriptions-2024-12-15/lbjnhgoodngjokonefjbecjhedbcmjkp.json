It can also be used by sellers to find good prices to sell their items at, and what items are selling good.\n\nAfter installation, to begin you need to search an item on ebay and then click the extension. It will say processing membership, and then display a different page based on the results. If no membership is found it will ask you to enter the license key generated when you purchased the subscription on\nhttps://csimplemented.gumroad.com/l/store-scraper or https://csimplemented.gumroad.com/l/scraper-bundle. In addition, the account(email) that you are signed in on while accessing the extension on must be the same as the one you bought the license on. Upon valid verification all you need to do is click off of the extension and click back on. In the case that you already saved a valid license key into the program it will display a page where you can scrape the information off of ebay. There are many options for scraping, sorting, displaying, and downloading the data.\n\nTo activate the program a valid license key is needed along with being signed into the same account upon purchasing the subscription that you are while accessing the extension.\n\nIf for whatever reason you need to clear the license key saved in the storage(it will not deactivate only clear it from storage) you need to navigate to the chrome extensions options page.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWhen Ebay updates their website, we will try to get an update out soon, but we must wait for the update to be reviewed by the google chrome team.\n\nBy using this service you admit to reading and automatically agree to the terms of use, disclaimer, and privacy policy.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis service can scrape information very quickly.\nWe are not responsible for bot detection and consequences that  ebay imposes such as but not limited to IP banning and account termination.\nYou as the user must err on the side of caution and take preventative steps including but not limited to slowing the scraping speed(which one can do after having clicked the extension), using services such as VPN's to make sure ebay can not ban your IP, and not being signed into an account or atleast not being signed into your main account."
