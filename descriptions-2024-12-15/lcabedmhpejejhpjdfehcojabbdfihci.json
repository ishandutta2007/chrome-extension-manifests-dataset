Click on the icon and you'll see a list of the current and upcoming soccer matches that there are streams for. Click on the match you wish to watch and you'll get a list of links.\n\nThis extension uses www.reddit.com (whichever football streaming subreddit that is currently not banned) for its data. The large number of dedicated streamers and watchers over there ensure that there are streams available for all of the matches played in the popular leagues.\n\nYou can search through the matches by typing on your keyboard. Pressing Enter will open the first match in the table.\n\nThe code behind the extension is open sourced: https://github.com/davidtimovski/soccer-streamlined"
