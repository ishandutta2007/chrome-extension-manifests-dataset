In this 3D environment you can have many different tabs represented and when one of the 3D objects representing a certain tab and the tab's URL is clicked then that tab becomes active or, if it was closed, a new tab is opened with the URL.\n\nThe 3D environment has 9 square places numbered from 1 to 9 and by default the tabs 3D objects are added to place number 7. To change the target place number the user clicks the extension's pinned icon while the Umniverse tab is active an then chooses the place number from 1 to 9.\n\nAs the tabs are represented with the image of the tab when it was active, it becomes easy to choose a tab mainly through viewing their respective images on the 3D objects. This way the 3D tab management environment becomes easy to use, intuitive and productive."
