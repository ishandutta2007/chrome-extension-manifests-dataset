If so then this extension is for you. Designed to help folks better report and avoid scammers and allow the community to better identify problem ads and abusers of CL. And the best part is just use CL like you always do.\n\nThis extension:\n1. Analyzes ad's for scammers using GMail addresses and lets you know how many ads have been logged / reported using that email address.\n\n2. If a phone number is found it is checked for how many ads have been logged / reported using that phone number and if it has been previously reported it will display the carrier information. Many scammers have taken to using free text or phone services and this can be helpful in identifying abuse.\n\n3. Keeps track of when others using the extension have reported an ad, and shows you inline how many reports were made for a particular ad.\n\n4. Analyzes image used in advertisements to help identify patterns of scammers.\n\nBy allowing the community to work together and help to identify scammers we should be able to reduce the chances that people are ripped off and hopefully can make things harder for those who are scamming to be successful"
