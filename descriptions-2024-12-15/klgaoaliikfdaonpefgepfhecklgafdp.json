Then the app will show a dropdown list of all SPP devices that the Bluetooth adaptor knows about. That's very important: basically if you don't see your device listed (or any device even) it means you need to pair the SPP device with your Chromebook before opening the app. Then, when you open the app you should find your device in the dropdown.\n\nOnce you connect to your SPP device the app works much like the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE. Text to send needs to be typed into the box at the top, and sent using the send button. Again like the Arduino serial monitor, you can choose the type of line ending you want from the dropdown by the text box.\n\nAt the bottom of the app you'll also find two buttons: one to clear the text and one to save it. Clicking the save button causes download of the whole of the text received from the SPP device since it was last cleared. You can scroll back through the text too, although preferably not while the SPP device is sending text as the last received text is always scrolled to when it arrives.\n\nAlso, the text is retained when you disconnect and reconnect, as long as you don't close the app, so that you can collect and save data from multiple devices.\n\nThis project is open-ource and you can inspect the code, or even download it to use in your own code, and report bugs, at the Github repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/drandrewthomas/ChromeOS_Bluetooth_SPP_terminal."
