Tracking movement in this indicator gives insight into FII views about the markets\n\nHigher than average value suggests bullish FII view about the market\n\nVolatility\nVolatility is measured by the India VIX index. It is the implied volatility of 1 month Nifty options and is a measure of the market's expectation of volatility in the near term\n\nHigh VIX value suggests that market participants are expecting increased risk and volatility in the market\n\nSkew\nVolatility only tells us that the markets are expecting some movement, but doesn't tell us anything about the direction. Skew is used to measure the expectations around market direction. It is calculated as the difference between implied volatilities (IV) of OTM put options and OTM call options of Nifty\n\nSo, a higher than average value of skew represents a high chance of downward movement\n\n\nMomentum\nIt is the difference between 90D & 30D exponential moving averages of Nifty, divided by 90D moving average\n\nA positive value indicates an uptrend and vice versa\n\n\nMarket Breadth\nIt is calculated by dividing AD Ratio by AD Volume (Modified Arms Index)\n\nA relative low value indicates strong market move supported by volumes\n\nPrice Strength\nIt is tracked by subtracting % of stocks near their 52W low from % of stocks near their 52W high to calculate the net % of stocks near their 52W high\n\nHigher value indicates better price strength in the market\n\n\nDemand for Gold\nIt is the relative price return of Gold vs Nifty for last 2 weeks\n\nIf the return of gold is increasing relative to Nifty, it indicates a movement away from equities into safer commodities like Gold"
