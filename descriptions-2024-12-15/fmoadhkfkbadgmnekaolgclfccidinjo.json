Unlocking allows a new tip to greet you with each new tab.\n\n3) Effortless Tip Navigation: Quickly cycle through tips without leaving your tab by clicking the rotate icon at the bottom right.\n\n4) Track Your Progress: The extension remembers your last position when you close the browser and picks up right where you left off upon reopening. It also tracks your progress separately for each programming language, resuming from your last point whenever you switch languages.\n\nEmbrace a micro-learning approach with this extension and enjoy your coding journey! The present version is tailored for beginners, while the future release will introduce enhanced customization options to accommodate learners across all skill levels, from novice to advanced."
