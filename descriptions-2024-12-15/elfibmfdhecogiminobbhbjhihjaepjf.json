So, I built a second brain using AI, which helps me learn better and faster! üöÄ\n\nThis is a chrome extension which automatically transcribes summarizes the content of the videos I watch. üß† Not just that, it can also save the markdown files for easy editing. ‚ú®\n\nI decided to take things a little further and added the feature for it to directly store the transcriptions and summary to Capacities as well! üìù\n\nIs this extension free?\nYes, the extension is free to use. You can download it from the Chrome Web Store.\n\nIs this project open-source?\nNo. This project is not open-source.

I built this extension to help the community and make it accessible to everyone, hence everything so far is free.
