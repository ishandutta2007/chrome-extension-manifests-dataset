Despite having the best digital encryption available, there comes a time when private data needs to be presented in a way in which the recipient can understand. Unfortunately, this generally means inadvertently presenting the information in a way which others can understand as well (e.g. Written in plain text on a screen). What that leaves is the risk for that information to be captured, be it by over-the-shoulder onlookers, pictures, or remote viewing. To prevent that vulnerability, I created a new type of visual encryption, called braincryption, which secures information in this interface between a user and their digital device. In the end, a user will be able to read sensitive information in the view of others without exposing that information to them."
