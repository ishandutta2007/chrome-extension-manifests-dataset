If you close a tab accidentally you can right click a tab and pick re-open closed tab as many times as you like.  \n\nNow with configurable keyboard shortcuts to jump to your last tab or cycle through the last 3 tabs you were on.\n\nThis extension deals with SELECTED TAB HISTORY... when you have many tabs open which one did you have selected previously?  This extension will help you there.  \n\nDid you lose your last tab?  The last tab you were on will be at the top of the list.\n\nAlso useful to close many tabs quickly (click and drag with middle mouse button over the list).  Fortunately Google Chrome added a feature that lets you shift click to select a bunch of tabs at once to close many.  You can also click and drag the search results in the last tab popup to select multiple tabs, then drag them to a new window.\n\nThis extension provides an alternate TabMenu.  When you first load the extension you won't see any tabs.  This is OK, because you haven't visited any tabs to create any tab click history yet.  Click on a few of your tabs, then check the menu.  You should see your previous tab at the top.  You can click the menu very quickly and select the first option repeatedly.  This should flip you back and forth between your two most recent tabs, no matter where they are in the tab bar.  \n\nSearch feature will search both tab titles and URLs, if you put a space it will have to find each word in either the tile or the URL.\n\nYou can configure the maximum number of tab click history states that will be saved for each window full of tabs you are running.  You can also enable a feature that collects icons for the page you view.  If you view a tab too quickly its possible an icon won't be generated or it won't show up in tab click history.  Under normal usage however, if you ever loose the tab you were just on and can't find it or don't want to look for it in a list, this is the extension for you, because it should be right at the top!  Enjoy.  \n\nWhen updates occur you may loose your tab click history.  This extension provides similar functionality to Tab Menu but provides the key feature of showing tabs based on how recently they were viewed.  Also can generate thumbnails (beta).  Middle clicking to close tab menu items is now supported.  A bug where closing windows could change tabs on the next window has been resolved.  \n\nIf you'd like to help please star this issue: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37739\n\nor Rate 5 stars below\n\nConfigurable default functionality on a per window basis.  There is also functionality that supports selecting the correct tab if you detach a tab dragging it out of the window."
