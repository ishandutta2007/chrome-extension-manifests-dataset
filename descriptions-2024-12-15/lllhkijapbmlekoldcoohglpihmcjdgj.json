A difference from ShowIP is that Chrome does not leave enough room to automatically show the full IP address. For this reason just the last segment is shown automatically but the full IP address is available by clicking on the icon. You can also assign a mnemonic / abbreviation and colors through the Options panel.\n\nPublished under the MIT License.\n\nGitHub listing: https://github.com/jcottrell/ServerIP\n\nNote that it requires some type of network traffic with the site before it will register the IP address."
