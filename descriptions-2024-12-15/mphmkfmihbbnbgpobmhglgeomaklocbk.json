This Chrome extension intelligently adjusts the brightness of YouTube videos, ensuring you catch every terrifying detail, especially during those spine-chilling horror game scenes. By dynamically analyzing video frames in real-time, “Fear No Dark” identifies dark regions and selectively enhances brightness without overexposing already bright areas. Perfect for horror game enthusiasts who want to experience every eerie moment in perfect clarity. Fear no dark corner or shadowy room again!\n\nFeatures:\n\n\t•\tReal-Time Brightness Adjustment: Analyzes video frames in real-time and applies brightness adjustments dynamically.\n\t•\tSelective Enhancement: Only enhances dark regions, maintaining the natural look of bright areas.\n\t•\tSmooth Transitions: Utilizes a smoothing factor to apply gradual brightness changes, preventing abrupt visual artifacts.\n\t•\tUser-Friendly Controls: Easily enable or disable the extension, set minimum brightness levels, and adjust the frequency of analysis through the extension’s popup interface.\n\t•\tOptimized for Horror Games: Tailored specifically to ensure you don’t miss any spooky details in horror game videos.\n\nTechnical Approach:\n\n\t•\tDiagonal Pixel Sampling: Innovatively samples pixels along diagonal lines across video frames to get a representative brightness value, improving the accuracy of brightness detection in various lighting conditions.\n\t•\tGrid-Based Analysis: Divides each video frame into a grid and calculates the average brightness for each section. This allows for localized adjustments, ensuring that only dark areas are brightened.\n\t•\tAdaptive Brightness Adjustment: Applies a brightness factor selectively to dark regions, with an upper cap to prevent overexposure. This ensures that bright areas, such as those illuminated by flashlights, remain natural.\n\t•\tIncremental Adjustments with Smoothing: Instead of abrupt changes, brightness adjustments are applied incrementally using a smoothing factor. This creates a seamless viewing experience without noticeable flickering.\n\nWith “Fear No Dark,” experience horror game videos the way they were meant to be seen—clear, detailed, and full of suspense. Never be left in the dark again!"
