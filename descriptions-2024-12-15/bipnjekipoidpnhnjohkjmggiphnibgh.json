Posts can be organized and displayed in a number of different ways:\n\nCategory view: Show posts under categories to help your audience easily access posts on specific topics, job listings or items for sale. This is ideal if you run an informational group, advertise jobs, or use Facebook as a sales platform.\n\nCalendar view: Display posts on a calendar under the days that you want your audience to interact with them. This is perfect if you run a course via your Facebook group or if you want to encourage daily activity in your group. This can apply to any niche, be it educational, fitness or other!\n\nPost Date view: Make sure your audience sees all of your posts in date order. New posts will no longer get lost in a sea of comments on older posts.\n\nIndex view: Easily sort posts under their index names, just like you do with files and folders.\n\nPostIndexer can be used on both an individual level and group level:\n\nUse it on an individual level to help you save and manage the Facebook posts that you like, and never lose a post again.\n\nUse it on a group level to save, organize and share Facebook posts in your own way and make sure they are seen by your audience. Maximize the exposure of posts saved within the indexes that you create and significantly boost the post reach. \n\nEvery book needs an index, even Facebook, and that's why we created PostIndexer. We hope you enjoy using it!\n\nDisclaimer: PostIndexer is not affiliated with Facebook in any way."
