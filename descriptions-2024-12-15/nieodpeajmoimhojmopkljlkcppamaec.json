Very convenient for viewing for example image threads on forums.\n\n- Lightweight - doesn't use any additional Javascript libraries.\n- Safe - Does not inject ads or analytics, does not send any data to any remote server.\n- Responsive - scales between 2-4 columns based on browser window size.\n- No duplicate images. Checks image sources for duplicate images so for example on forums where the same image might be quoted multiple times, the gallery only shows one instance of it.\n- Light and dark theme option.\n- Lightbox for showing image in full size. Also handles links leading to a larger version of the image.\n- Support for showing forum thread page navigation in gallery and auto opening gallery when moving between thread pages. Support might vary based on forum software\n- See options for keyboard shortcuts.\n\nRelease notes:\n\n2.3.0\n- Refactored code\n- Various small bug fixes\n- Even faster\n\n2.2.0\n- Compiled with newer tools.\n- Support all safe URL schemes allowed for extensions by Google.\n- Load at document idle so it has even less impact on your page loading speed.\n\n2.1.0\n- Add getting context text for image.\n- Various bug fixes and tweaks\n\nCopyright Mikko Lakomaa.
