By overlaying each image's alt text and calculating the match percentage between the alt text and the page title, Altlands provides valuable insights to optimize your images for better SEO.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOverlay alt text on images with a single click.\nCalculate the match percentage between alt text and page title.\nHighlight images with missing alt tags using a sad face emoji (ðŸ˜ž).\nToggle the overlay on and off easily.\nHow it works:\nWhen you activate Altlands on a webpage, it overlays each image with its corresponding alt text. If the alt text is missing, a sad face emoji (ðŸ˜ž) is displayed instead, indicating an opportunity to improve SEO by adding a relevant alt tag.\n\nAdditionally, Altlands calculates the match percentage between the image's alt text and the page title. This metric helps you assess whether the alt text is relevant to the page's content. For example, on a product page, the main product image should ideally have a nearly 100% match with the page title, ensuring that the image is properly optimized for search engines.\n\nExample use case:\nImagine you have an e-commerce website with multiple product pages. On each product page, there is a main product image that should be optimized for search engines. By using Altlands, you can quickly assess whether the alt tags of these images are relevant and SEO-friendly.\n\nIf the main product image has a nearly 100% match with the page title, it indicates that the alt tag is well-optimized for search engines. However, if you see a sad face emoji (ðŸ˜ž) in the overlay, it highlights an opportunity to make the image more SEO-friendly by adding a relevant alt tag. This can help improve the search engine rankings of your product pages and increase the visibility of your products.\n\nBy using Altlands, you can efficiently evaluate and optimize the alt tags across your website, ensuring better SEO performance and higher search engine rankings.\n\nAdditional instructions:\nIf you need further assistance with Altlands or have any questions, please feel free to contact our support team."
