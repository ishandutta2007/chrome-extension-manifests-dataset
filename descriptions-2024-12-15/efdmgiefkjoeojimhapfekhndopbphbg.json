A Chinese term, for example, is easier to lookup on a Chinese search engine while Cyrillic is easier on a Russian one. bLeengo automatically switches the search engine based on the language input. This removes the needed to constantly switch back and forth and provides more relevant localized search results.\n\nIn this version:\n- Automatically changes the search engine to the most relevant one, based on the current input language\n- Out of the box functionality with no set-up\n- Support of auto-localization of Japanese, Chinese, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic\n- Mapping display\n\nWe're in Beta, so, please, contact us at bLeengo.com if you'd like to contribute code or help the project in any other way.\n\nTerms of Use & Privacy Policy: https://www.bleengo.com/privacy"
