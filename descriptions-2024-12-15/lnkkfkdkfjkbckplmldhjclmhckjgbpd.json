It enhances your coding experience by offering real-time access to your leaderboard rank, visualizing your progress with a dynamic badge icon, and presenting historical rank data through an interactive line chart.\n\nKey Features:\n\nLeaderboard Rank at a Glance: \"WakaTrack Leaderboard\" places your current leaderboard rank right in your browser's action icon badge. This number serves as a quick indicator of your standing in the Wakatime community. Lower numbers signify higher ranks, with 1 being the coveted top spot.\n\nRank-Based Badge Colorization: The extension goes beyond just displaying your rank. It dynamically changes the background color of the badge text to reflect your rank's movements. When your rank climbs higher, the badge turns a soothing green. Conversely, if your rank slips, it adopts a striking red hue, ensuring that your progress is immediately visible.\n\nDaily Updates: \"WakaTrack Leaderboard\" fetches and updates your rank data daily. This means you always have access to the latest information on your leaderboard position without any manual intervention.\n\nInteractive Line Chart: Clicking on the action icon opens a user-friendly popup interface. Here, you'll find a line chart that visualizes your historical leaderboard ranks over time. Each point on the chart represents your rank on a specific day since the extension's installation. It provides an insightful view of your progress, allowing you to spot trends, improvements, or areas where you can make adjustments in your coding routine.\n\nHandling Null Ranks: In cases where you're not in the leaderboard, the extension doesn't leave you in the dark. It clearly indicates null ranks, creating gaps between the lines on the chart for those days. This transparency ensures that you're aware of your status, whether you're actively ranked or temporarily absent from the leaderboard.\n\n\"WakaTrack Leaderboard\" offers an exceptional experience for \"Wakatime\" users by keeping them informed and motivated. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to maintain your leaderboard dominance or a newcomer striving to climb the ranks, this extension is your go-to companion for tracking your programming journey.\n\nUnlock the power of data-driven insights with \"WakaTrack Leaderboard\" and take control of your coding progress like never before."
