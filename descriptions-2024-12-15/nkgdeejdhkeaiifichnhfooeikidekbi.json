This extension will automate the discovery queue process so you don't have to click \"next\" on each item to get your trading cards.\n\nTo use this extension, just install it and then navigate to https://store.steampowered.com/explore/, where you can set how many discovery queues you want to complete. The extension will complete the queues for you while you do something else—or you can just watch it work if you want. After the discovery queues are completed, a message will display on the last page letting you know it finished.\n\nView code at:\nhttps://github.com/jsejcksn/skip-steam-discovery-queues\n\nThis extension is not affiliated with Valve Corporation.\n\nCHANGES\n\nv1.0.3, 2018-06-30\n- MUCH faster—runs after DOMContentLoaded\n\nv1.0.2, 2018-06-29\n- Starting URL matches with or without a /\n\nv1.0.1, 2018-06-28\n- Replace number input with three buttons\n- Fixed position\n\nv1.0.0, 2018-06-28\n- Initial upload"
