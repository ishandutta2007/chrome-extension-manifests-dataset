In an earlier time, you may have had to forward the email or go through the tedious process of capturing and sending screenshots. But now, with the Share emails via secure URL link by cloudHQ, you've got a much more efficient tool at your fingertips. With just a single click, the email can be turned into a secure, sharable link. You then paste this link directly into your Skype conversation with your partner.
