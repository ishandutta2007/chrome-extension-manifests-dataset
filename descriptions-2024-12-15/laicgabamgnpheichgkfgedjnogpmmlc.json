Simply mark the search-terms in your text and hit the button!\n-> customizable text \"Accessed on:\" for the access date in online sources\n--------------------------\n\nRemember: you need \\usepackage{hyperref} for links to work properly!\n\n\n1. If you want to cite a web-page or pdf you currently have opened, you can simply click the button and it copies a BibTex entry to the clipboard. It fetches title, url, accessed on date.\n\nIt also gets the publishing year and month by scraping web.archive.org for the exact url!\n\n2. If you want to cite or find a source, you just mark the title/author name/doi or whatever, and press the button while your text is marked. The extension compiles a list of Sources matching your search. By clicking on a source it automatically creates a matching BibTex Entry in your clipboard. \n\nCurrently it is capable of searching Springer and Worldcat(scraping) but further implementation would be interesting.\n\n3. The Text \"Accessed on:\" in your bibtex entry is customizable through the Options!\n\nNow you just have to paste your entries somewhere in your bib file and voila you can cite them as usual!"
