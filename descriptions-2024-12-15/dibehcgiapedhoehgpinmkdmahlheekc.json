It started costing me time so I decided I would make this extension to help out myself and others.\n\n# Update - v2.0.6 - 10-21-2024\n- Update YouTube support\n\n# Update - v2.0.2 - 04-16-2024\n- Overhaul UI to make it easier to use\n- Add ability to additionally color the default (non-visited) links\n- Add allowlist (whitelist) in addition to the existing blocklist (blacklist)\n- Add additional contrast option\n\n# Update - v1.1.0 - 04-06-2019\n- Added editing of blacklist.\n- Added button to add current URL to blacklist.\n- Adjusted styling."
