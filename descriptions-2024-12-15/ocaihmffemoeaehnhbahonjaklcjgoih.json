The plugin now works again.\n- Version 1.0.5 (2024-11-01): Fixed a problem where addresses have not been rendered correctly.\n- Version 1.0.0 (2024-07-14): Initial release.\n\n== How to use ==\nInstall the extension, and addresses will appear in the listings automatically.\n\n== How it works ==\nOur plugin uses historical sale data to find accurate addresses. If a property hasn't been sold recently, the address may not be found. You'll see the complete address right on listing pages and individual property pages saving you time and effort.\n\n== Contact ==\nHave any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi?
