I'll be working over time to minimize this to make this as much of a \"click-play-and-forget\" experience as possible.\n\nUpdate History:\n\n0.0.5 - 8/21/2024 - Update to fix after removal of certain browser features that the plugin relied on.\n0.0.4 - 3/23/2022 - Bug fixes\n0.0.3 - 3/22/2022 - Adjust queuing behavior. You may now either queue videos to the end of the list or play it next. This can be done from either the popup or the context menu.\n0.0.2 - 3/20/2022 - Bug fixes\n0.0.1 - 3/19/2022 - Initial Release"
