This extension would allow you to take a user study on your desktop using Google Chrome browser. During the User study, the screen of your computer and your voice (and optionally the Camera) would be recorded, therefore make sure you are in a quiet environment and all other personal / confidential applications are closed. The extension is only active during the time between the starting of a user study and completing the submission of results.\n\nAfter you complete the User Study and submit results, it would usually take less than 10 minutes to upload your response to our server. After that give us couple of days to review your work. If the responses are accepted by the owner of the User study, you would be paid the incentives.\n\nIn case are not yet registered as a User Advocate with UXArmy, please register here https://www.uxarmy.com/user-advocate"
