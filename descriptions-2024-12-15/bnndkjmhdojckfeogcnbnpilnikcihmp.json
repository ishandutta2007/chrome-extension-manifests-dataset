Cards you can - to some extent - customize to your own needs.\n\nYou want to see the associated epic? A couple of custom fields on every card? The estimate in story points? (And a couple other things ...) Well, break out the confetti: This extension will do the trick for you!\n\nOf course it will also show you the issue's summary, the issue's key - the basic information. That way you can find it quickly when you want to look it up in JIRA. It also shows the issue's type icon, so you can see if it's a story, a bug or something else - that way it makes the single issue's cards easier to distinguish and loosens up the whole picture visually which in turn makes it easier to find your way aroud the number of cards on your board.\n\nAnd the best thing is: you can trigger this extension from an agile board! If you have a scrum board and a sprint is currently running, then CardJIRA will print the sprint's issues. If you have a kanban boad, then you can select a single or multiple issues (ctrl + click) and CardJIRA will print those selected issues.\n\nOf course you can also print single issues - just open the issue and click the CardJIRA icon. CardJIRA will then generate a single card from this issue.\n\nAnd for everything else you can put together a JIRA filter. Once it's saved, you can click the CardJIRA icon and the extension will print cards for all the issues found by this JQL filter.\n\nI ask for permission for \"all sites\", because I cannot know what host you're running JIRA on. The addon will only run on JIRA pages and display an error message when triggered on a non-JIRA page.\n\nCurrently there is only one default layout / print style for cards. But I already prepared the plugin to support a number of different layouts in the future. And I plan to add those layouts, because I'd like this addon to suit many more use cases that arise along the way.\n\nThis addon is not created / supported by Atlassian.\n\nWhy I wrote this addon:\nI wrote this chrome extension, because there was no way for me to print out task cards from JIRA that presented the relevant information in a way that was easy to use for my team members in the daily scrum meeting. Or at least I wasn't happy with the options I had: With other plugins etc. it all either looked too uniform and we had difficulties to recognize the issues and to distinguish on from another while standing around our (physical) task board. Or it just didn't show the relevant information we would need while discussing yesterday's results and challenges and today's goals.\n\nSo after using a server side script on my local machine for quite some time, I thought that if I turned this into a browser extension I could not only streamline the whole process for me, but also share the benefits with my colleagues and - well - I guess: you.\n\nI hope it is of use to you and saves you some time!\n\nCheers,\nTom!"
