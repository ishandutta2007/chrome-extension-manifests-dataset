(In the current version that only applies to single player. Future releases will expand to multiplayer.)\n\nUsers can create and manage lists of location bookmarks. Lists can be used to create new maps or to download for third party use.\n\nIn addition, this extension adds annotation support. Map makers can annotate rounds with text, images, and links. Anybody using the extension will be able to see the annotations. Good for teaching, clues, or just plain fun.\n\nAn example annotated map can be found at: https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/638fd9b06e3136a88cb18e20/play\n\nNo features require registration expect creating annotations. Registration is done through google login.\n\n(Please note, that in its current state, there is still an issue with background workers falling asleep after 30 seconds. If you are logged in and an action fails, try it again and it should succeed. This will be patched in future releases)"
