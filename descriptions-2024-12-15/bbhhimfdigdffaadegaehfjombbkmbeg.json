With the advent of new technologies, it has become ever more difficult to determine what that manner is.  In ages past, your words were confined to the physical boundaries around you: a lecture hall, a dinner table, etc.  It was easy to tailor your actions to fit your audience.  Nowadays, however, anything you post online has the potential to be seen by the entire world.  The problem is how to inform people of the audience they are sharing with.  \n\nAs more and more communication moves to technology, it is up to us to decipher how we portray ourselves through the Internet. Many users of our age are unaware of the correct tone they should have when using various sites and are thus unaware of the image they give off. Some use the same language whether writing an email to a professional or commenting on Reddit, two vastly different situations that demand context-based voices. Assuming most people would prefer to act ethically and are merely held back by a lack of knowledge, we hope that filling this gap in their understanding would help to increase the overall quality of communication online.\n\nThis Chrome Extension helps to combat issues with online etiquette by providing detailed etiquette tips for various social networking, blog, email, forum, media, and news sites.
