You're browsing your crush's posts from five years ago and you accidentally click like. Now they're going to receive a notification about that. Time to change your name and move to Alaska.\n\nBut not if you have Like Lock installed! This extension turns off the like button so that it won't work even if you click it on purpose.\n\nTest Like Lock out on a post of your own to make sure it's working before using it in a high stakes scenario."
