This means that the extension now uses the \"Identity\" and \"Email\" permissions of Google Chrome. This is simply to verify who the rating is coming from and does not grant us access to any personal information.\n\nThis extension is designed for use by Rutgers University students to increase the functionality of Rutgers University course listing websites.\n\nThis extension interacts with the WebReg site, the Schedule of Classes site, and the Course Schedule Planner site. It places a button next to each instructors name which allows users to search the professor on RateMyProfessors.com. This allows students to easily and seamlessly gain feedback on their professors.\n\nStudents can also submit their own feedback on their professors by clicking the 'rate' button. This allows students to share their own experiences with their professors.\n\nInitial development for this application took place at HackRU Spring 2015 in Piscataway, New Jersey, on 4/18/15. It ranked in the Top 5 Hacks, as well as earned the title of \"Best Rutgers Hack\".\n\nby Corentin Rejaud, Daniel Tsioni, and Gavriel Tsioni\ngooeybar@gmail.com"
