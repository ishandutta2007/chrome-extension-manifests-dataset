This extension aims to help solve that issue by putting a white or black border around the focused element, depending on whichever results in a higher contrast.\n\nFocus Indicator uses multiple strategies to aim for it to work effectively across all websites, but it can't account for every improper accessibility setup. For example, if a site has a focusable element out of the screen's bounds, it won't show any difference.\n\nIt prioritizes function over form. If you'd like, you can disable the extension on certain sites (blacklist them) or you can enable the extension only on certain sites (whitelist them) by clicking on the extension and changing the options there.\n\nAt the time of initially uploading this, it works on the latest version of Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Firefox.\n\n\nFor feature requests or bug reports, feel free to send me an email: contact@stefior.com"
