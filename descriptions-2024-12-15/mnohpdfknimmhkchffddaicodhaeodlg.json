These include:\n \n\t•\tAssessment Frame Boundary: Alerts users when their cursor moves outside the designated assessment window, preventing unauthorized actions.\n\t•\tTab Management: Automatically closes all other tabs before an assessment begins and blocks the opening of new tabs during the test, ensuring focus and preventing access to external resources.\n\t•\tClipboard and Printing Controls: Disables copying, pasting, printing, and right-clicking during assessments to safeguard against data breaches and cheating.\n\t•\tSingle Screen Enforcement: Ensures that only one screen is active during the test, blocking connections to external devices like HDMI or USB drives.\n\t•\tEyes and Face Tracking: Monitors and analyzes eye and facial movements to detect and report any suspicious behavior during the exam.\n \nThese robust features work together to create a secure and controlled testing environment, allowing educators to administer exams with confidence and trust in the results.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://simplifiediq.com/privacy-policy/"
