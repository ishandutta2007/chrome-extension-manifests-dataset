It encrypts your internet traffic directly within your Chrome browser, offering a convenient way to browse securely on public Wi-Fi or access geo-restricted content.\n\nHow the Internxt VPN protects you online\n- Prevent targeted ads\nThis VPN significantly reduces the number of targeted ads you see. This makes it more difficult for advertisers to track your browsing habits and build a profile on you. Since advertisers can't target you as effectively, you'll see fewer ads based on your interests when you browse the web.\n\n- Bypass annoying Geo-restrictions\nOur private VPN scrambles your data, making it unreadable by websites. Since the website can't pinpoint your location, it can't enforce geo-restrictions based on your location. This allows you to access content that might be unavailable in your region.\n\n- Protect your online privacy\nWe offer the best security and encryption at lightning-fast speeds. Our encryption protects your connection as it travels between your device and the internet. This is particularly important when using public Wi-Fi networks, where your data could be vulnerable to hackers.\n\n- Strict no-logs policy\nWe do not save any user connection logs, meaning our free VPN doesn't record or store any data about your online activity. This includes information like the websites you visit, the files you download, or the apps you use. We keep this information completely private and anonymous. \n\n- Increased online privacy\nSurf the web in complete privacy without anybody knowing where you’re connecting from. \n\n- Surf the Web Anonymously.\nAvoid your ISP from monitoring your activity and prevent websites from ad tracking and targeting.
