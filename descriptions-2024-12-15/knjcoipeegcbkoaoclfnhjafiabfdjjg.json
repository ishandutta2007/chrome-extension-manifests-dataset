We had television for that.

Our tool, which is completely unaffiliated, offers you several features like rating from top review sites like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, TV.com, etc.\n\nWe are gearing up to provide you completely unbiased watch recommendations which keeps you at the center and not the platforms or content affiliations.\n\n\nKey Features:\n- We provide you ratings for the movies or other content you watch on streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, and etc.\n- Want to watch a movie but not sure about the rating, one-click on our extension helps you find it out\n- Unable to decide whether to watch a movie or not, one-click on our extension helps you understand what ratings websites like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, etc. have to say"
