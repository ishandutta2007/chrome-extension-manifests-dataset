The aim of this extension is to cover as many music video sites as possible.\nAll credits to David Å abata!\n\nThis is developer preview version, may be buggy but will be released faster than official release.\nFor official release refer to:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastfm-scrobbler/hhinaapppaileiechjoiifaancjggfjm\nAs this is open source, you can see check differences between canary and official release here:\nhttps://github.com/Bonaducci/web-scrobbler/tree/canary-beta\n\n!!! IF THE EXTENSION STOPS WORKING, REPORT ON GITHUB ONLY !!!\nhttps://github.com/david-sabata/Chrome-Last.fm-Scrobbler/issues\n\nWhen you firstly come to a supported website a new tab opens where you have to authorize the extension to use the Last.fm API. You need to do this only once, when the extension is firstly installed; it isn't needed on updates (which are automatic, of course).\n\nThe status of scrobbler is shown in the omnibox (the addres field) on the right by the icon. Optionally you can enable desktop notifications and Youtube specific statuses (as shown on the extension preview). \nNote that it may take a while to contact the server and the \"Scrobbling\" text won't be added until Last.fm server confirms the reqest.\n\nIf the song doesn't get recognized, you can manually correct the title by clicking on the scrobbler icon. (This works only when song is not recognized - question mark icon.)\n\nTo temporarily disable scrobbling, click the status icon in the omnibox.\n\nSee the extension about page for more info and changelog."
