We allow you to designate from our drop-down list of non-profit organizations which organization you want the proceeds of your link to go to (we currently have over ten, with more coming very soon!). \n\nThis extension allows you to create gale.io links in one click, by appearing in the context menu when you right-click on a link on any webpage. First, click on the top popup bar to select a non-profit from our current list; that non-profit will get the proceeds of any links you shorten and share (until you change it by clicking on the popup again). Then, whenever you see an interesting link online, just right-click, and the option \"Shorten as a gale.io link\" should appear. By clicking that, you now have a gale.io link you can share!\n\nYou can learn more about us by visiting http://gale.io (we've also been featured on Product Hunt at www.producthunt.com/posts/gale-io)."
