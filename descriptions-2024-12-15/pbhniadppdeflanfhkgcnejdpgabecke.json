Then the marked text will be put into a template and copied to clipboard automatically, and you'll be automatically redirected to chatGPT page, so you can paste it.\n\nYou can change the template on extension options, you can also change which link do you want to be redirected to.\n\nExample template: \"Please tell me about {text} in a very simple way as if I was 5 years old kid\". Here {text} is the placeholder for the text you marked.\n\nE.g. If you mark a text like \"Himalayan mountains\", right click and click on \"Send2AI\" on the context menu (the menu that appear when you right click), you'll be redirected automatically to the ChatGPT (or any link you set on extension options page) having this on your clipboard ready to paste:\n\"Please tell me about Himalayan mountains in a very simple way as if I was 5 years old kid\". \nwhich is based on the template abovce. You can change the template on the extension options-\n\nInstall this extension to avoid the hassle of having to open ChatGPT and write the same type of prompt every time. Here just write a prompt once, and let this extension make it easier for you to use the ChatGPT when you browse online. For example you can use it to let ChatGPT explain you something you read online fast, make translations fast etc."
