By default, 25 items are shown in the popup, but you can change this from the options page. Each item has a title and a favicon (if available). Within the UI bottom section, there are few buttons. On the bottom-left side, there is a button to open all closed tabs. There is also a button to open the history tab. On the bottom-right side, the first button is to reload the UI. Next is the settings button to open the options page. The last two buttons are for the support page and donation.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/undo.html)."
