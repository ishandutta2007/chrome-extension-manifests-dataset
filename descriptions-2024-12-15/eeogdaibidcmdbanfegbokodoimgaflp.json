Ads, popups and notifications are among the most prominent ones, but there are also more subtle and pervasive ones: links.\n\nLinks are first class citizens on the web. One could even argue that they *are* the web. However, when it comes to reading, they can be a massive hindrance. They force the reader to make a micro-decision not to click on every link in that important article, resist the sirens of serendipity and contend with the fear of missing out. That's a lot of extra work.\n\n## It is more than ok to miss out: it is inevitable\n\nRiding the wave of the popular adage \"Ignorance is bliss\", Lyf turns pages into dead-ends (or *leaves* in tree structure terminology) by blending links back into the page's text. Links don't stand out anymore, and you can enjoy a more peaceful, intense and focused read.\n\n****\n\nPositively inspired by Maria Popova's extremely well cross-referenced articles (brainpickings.org), which I could never go to the bottom of without opening an inordinate amount of tabs."
