This extension demonstrates the working of the model Cross-SEAN which detects fake news on Twitter by employing an end-to-end mechanism.\n\nWhen the user clicks on the Chrome-SEAN icon, it automatically recognises if a Tweet Status is present on the userâ€™s screen and takes the tweet ID as input.\n\nThe tweet passes through our Deep Learning model, predicting label (Fake/Non-Fake) along with the confidence score. Moreover, the user has an option of Reporting a tweet fake or genuine in case there is a contradiction in opinion, this helps us improve our model."
