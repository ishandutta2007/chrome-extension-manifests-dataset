Additionally, links to foxnews.com on all other sites are disabled and replaced with the text \"[Fox News BLOCKED]\".\n\nThe extension works in two ways:\n1. When attempting to navigate to foxnews.com, the request is blocked before navigation begins  and you will see a \"www.foxnews.com is blocked\" error message instead.\n2. When visiting a website which contains links to foxnews.com, those links are replaced with a dummy link that reads \"[Fox News BLOCKED]\".\n\n\nUpdates:\n\nVersion 1.0.2:\n- Badge count fixed to accurately reflect number of links blocked on the current page\n- Minor bug fixes and optimizations"
