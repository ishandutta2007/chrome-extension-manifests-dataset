It has not been optimized to work on Genesis yet. This is handy when going through matches to quickly identify people who match a list of related individuals. There is also an option for building a database, should you wish to add kits you find are related to someone on the list.\n\nMatches will be highlighted on the GEDmatch page and a summary of the matches along with the total match size in cM will be generated.\n\n1.3.0 plugin now works with GEDmatch Genesis!\n1.3.2 version corrects for, hopefully, changes made in Genesis HTML.\n1.3.4 fixed issue with highlighting not functioning in some searches.\n1.3.5 fixed issue with double counting duplicate kits (either due to multiple copies of same kit or different kit numbers but same name.\n*****\n1.4.0 settings option for showing database now functional.\n1.4.1 few bugs fixed. Should now work on matches two kits on Genesis.\n1.4.2 one more bug caught.\n*****\n1.5.0 added ability to ignore matches with listed overlaps below 100,000\n1.5.3 bug fix and change to color highlighting scheme\n*****\n1.6.2 added option for automatically marking all matches for visualization options. Can be enabled in extension options.\n1.6.3 caught minor change in table layout for free searches on Genesis between Tier 1 and free account. Made it so free account did not work right.\n1.6.5 minor bug fixes.\n1.6.6 Genesis is merged with Gedmatch now. Corrected URL parsing so search works correctly again."
