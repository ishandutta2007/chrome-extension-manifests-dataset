Please read the support page to get more info on how to use the addon. Once the addon is fully trained, please click on the - Start - button and make gestures (Up, Down, and Stop) in front of the camera to scroll the active tab. Also, make sure to place your face/hand exactly in front of the camera (within the grey rectangle). As long as the camera is ON, the addon will look for your gestures and take action accordingly. If you want to stop the inferring process, please click on the - Stop - button once.\n\nNote: This addon is using the new AI engine called TensorFlow. Please visit the (https://www.tensorflow.org/js/) page to get more info about this new technology.\n\nTo report bugs, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/gesture-based-scroll.html)."
