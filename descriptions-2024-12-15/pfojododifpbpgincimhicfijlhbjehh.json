If there were some bookmarks at different directory or different name and the URL was the same it always gives you the first one.\n    It only moves in the folder, I thought I will get lost so I didn't implemented it.\n\nREASON:\n    As my bookmarks have grown the depth(folders) have also grown. All I wanted was go to the next bookmark but when I click the bookmark icon the depth was awaited. It was so tedious therefore I created this extension."
