There is NO LONGER the music check feature. In the development and deployment of 9.0.0, a serious bug was introduced. Until this bug can be solved, the extension features are being rolled back to the 8.0.0 version. A new version number is necessary when publishing to the web store, but version 10.0.0 has the exact same features and functionality as 8.0.0 did.\n\n9.0.0 UPDATE!\nThis is a major update that introduces a new feature: the detection of music videos! The extension now has an option to detect music videos and reset speed to 1 if it does. This only works for music from official YouTube™ Music channels (the ones with the little music note by the artist name). By default this is disabled so as not to disrupt the typical experience but it can be turned on in the options page!\n\n8.0.0 UPDATE!\nThere are no major User-facing changes in this update, however the extension now uses Manifest v3. This is necessary because Google will soon remove support for Manifest v2 from Chrome. No features or options should change and this update should be entirely transparent. \n\n7.0.0 UPDATE!\nText fields no longer mess with the extension's functionality. By default, when typing text on a webpage, the extension will ignore your hot keys so the speed doesn't change, and you can write comments in peace! You can still turn this option back on if, for some reason, you like changing speed while typing in the options page. \n\n6.1.2 UPDATE!\nReplaced Icon and text due to guidelines\n\n6.1.0 UPDATE!\nContributions from @jclaveau on GitHub to enable features in embedded YouTube™s and iframes from YouTube. \n\n6.0.0 UPDATE!\n\nThis is a breaking change. In an effort to make the extension work as closely as possible to how it was in 5.1.0 provided no options are changed, the following things were done\n1. 'keypress' was changed to 'keydown' this due to how macOS reports codes in keypress. This should be transparent to the users\n2. The options page no longer uses `keyCode` it now uses `key`. `keyCode` is deprecated and inconsistent between platforms and more opaque to use.\n3. `event.preventDefault()` is now an option and no longer forced on. Not calling preventDefault() is the old behavior of 5.1.0 so this decision is so that the extension more closely works like 5.1.0 if no key bindings are changed\n\nThis will make the extension act more like it did before 5.2.0. It does however break the keyboard shortcuts that people might have set until now\n\n\n5.2.0 UPDATE!\n\nNEW FEATURE: Change the keyboard shortcuts for the app! You can now change the keys that control the extension. Below (in the description) you can see the default keys used to control the extension. You can use the new options page to change which keys do what. There is also (though there has been for a while) the option to disable keyboard controls entirely if you prefer.\n\n---\n5.1.0 UPDATE!\nThis update has all of your favorite features of the last update PLUS now you can change the values of the buttons in the extension to whatever value you want so you have easy access to your favorite speed settings.\n\n---\n5.0.0 RECENTLY UPDATED!!! BUGS FIXED!! I noticed that when ads play it resets the speed the video. I have added a mechanism that ensures the speed is always moving at the current setting when the video is playing even after an ad interrupts it!!\n\n5.0.2 Fixed issue with the grave key and added number formatting so there are no long decimal points\n\n---\nThis extension lets you change the speed of YouTube™ videos in a more granular way than the default options in the player. The player on YouTube™ let's you change the speed to 0.25x, 0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, and 2.0x the normal speed. This extension lets you change the speed of playback to between 0.1x to 8.0x normal speed by steps of 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, or 0.05.\n\nOnce you find a speed you like, you can also save it as the default speed which all YouTube™ videos will play at when opening.\n\nYou can also program up to 7 \"preset speeds\" that allow you to simply click a button and set the speed of the YouTube video to your stored preset.\n\nBy default this extension adds a the ability to control the speed of a YouTube™ video and some playback with keyboard shortcuts.\n\nThe '+' and '-' keys to change the speed by 0.1 and to the '*' and '/' keys change the speed in increments of 1.0.\n\nIf you hold shift while pressing these, '+' and '-' move in steps of 0.05 and '*' and '/' move in steps of 0.5.\n\nIt also assigns '`' to reset the speed to 1.0x normal speed.\n\nFinally, it uses '[' and ']' to move through the video in time steps proportional to the speed of the video, rather than in increments of 5 or 10 seconds.\n\nThese shortcuts *can* be disabled on demand if you prefer not to have them and can be re-enabled at any time\n\nI made this extension for fun and because it really made my YouTube™ experience better. I published it because I thought it might be useful for other people as well. I cannot promise every single YouTube page and video will work perfectly with this extension.  YouTube has a lot of places like gaming, educational playlists, livestreams, etc.\n\nThis extension is open source on GitHub (see website) link, and I am open to suggestions, issues, and fixes but I cannot make any promises about what I will do with those things if i receive them.\n\nYouTube™ is a trademark of Google Inc.
