However, we're looking for beta testers, so if you're interested in getting early access please email info@synapcard.ai. We're particularly keen to hear from medical learners (med students, professional exams), but any learner is welcome!\n\n---\n\nInstructions:\n\nAfter downloading, add the extension to your toolbar. You can do this by clicking the \"Extensions\" button (in Chrome, top right of browser, looks like a puzzle piece), scrolling to the Synapcard extension, clicking options and selecting \"Show in toolbar\".\n\nTo use the extension, highlight a piece of information you wish to learn. For example, this could be the text \"the capital of France is Paris\". When you do this, you can click on the Synapcard icon to submit the fact. One it has been processed, a green tick will show on the Synapcard extension icon in the toolbar. You can then click the extension to see the formatted card.\n\nIn the current version, this extension is designed to interact with Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/). For this to work, you must: 1) Add the AnkiConnect add-on (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159), to allow communication with the App; 2) Have Anki open whilst using the extension. You can then select your deck, add cards and include custom tags, as with the normal Anki interface.\n\nBy default, the app allows processing of web pages. However, with host permissions enabled, it will also allow users to use the interface on PDF documents. **To use the document with local PDFs, go to the extensions page and check the \"Allow access to file URLs\" checkbox.**\n\n*Although anyone can download the extension, only those with an account will be able to access the functionality"
