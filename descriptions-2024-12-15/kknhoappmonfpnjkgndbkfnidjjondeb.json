Please, remember the password from your main e-mail, and do not use it anywhere else. You will need it in case of complete failure of your other endeavors. This password is the ultimate one. If you forget your master password, you can restore it through that e-mail.  \n\n2. Please think of master password. Remember this password, and using our Google Extension, you will generate securely protected passwords to access any website you are registered at. Just put the cursor at the \"enter password\" field, and then press the \"key\" extension button. You will be asked your master password, and then using the secure algorithm, the extension will generate the unique password to the website, USING THE  WEBSITE NAME AND THIS PASSWORD, and put it in the \"password\" field."
