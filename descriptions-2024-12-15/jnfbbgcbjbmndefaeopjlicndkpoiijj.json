The Sound Enhancement is a very good tool for you.\nYou can select sound configuration, such as Pop, Jazz, Rock etc. Otherwise, you can do it manually.\n\nNOTE: If you cannot switch video to the fullscreen mode, please press F11. This is a Chromium bug that Chromium dev still cannot solve yet.\n\nℹ️ The functionality of the extension periodically updates its configuration by fetching sound themes from external sources. To ensure optimal performance of the sound enhancement themes, we periodically improve them based on the latest insights and update them within the extension.\n\nHope you enjoy it!"
