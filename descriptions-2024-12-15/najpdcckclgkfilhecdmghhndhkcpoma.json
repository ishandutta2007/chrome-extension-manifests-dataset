This makes videos resume where they left off in the event that chrome is closed accidentally, crashes, or a tab is suspended through another means such as with the extension \"The Great Suspender\".\n\nKnown issues:\n  - Hourglass button looks broken in full screen mode\n\n0.0.0.7:\n  - Fixed an issue resulting in the tab icon blinking sometimes, or sometimes causing a memory leak.\n\n0.0.0.6:\n  - Minor changes\n  - Icon and screenshot added\n\n0.0.0.5:\n  - Hourglass button turns red when timer is disabled\n  - URL is updated to look like \"t=3m21s\" instead of \"t=201\" for times over a minute\n\n0.0.0.4:\n  - Fixed cases where the button may not show until after the page fully loads\n\n0.0.0.3:\n  - Added a button on youtube videos to disable the timer. Useful when sharing videos from the beginning.\n\n0.0.0.2:\n  - fixed a bug that spammed the right click menu of the back button"
