Not cool...\n\nFrom now on, you can use this Google Chrome extension to log in as any user directly without navigating away from the currently open Salesforce page. Additionally, you can directly access the user's settings, profile, and even their role.\n\nPretty awesome, right? 🥳\n\n⭐️ Features ⭐️\n◦ Query all active users with a standard Salesforce license\n◦ Search the list of users by first name, last name, profile name or user role name\n◦ Login as any user by a single click\n◦ Directly jump into the user settings\n◦ Logout again at any time and automatically get back to the page where you came from prior login\n◦ Directly open User, Profile or Role in Setup\n\n⭐️ Remarks ⭐️\n⚠️ Login access policies must be configured for system administrators.\n\n⚠️ Check Setup --> Security --> \"Login Access Policies\" and make sure \"Administrators Can Log in as Any User\" is enabled\n\n⚠️ When you logout as a user, you might have to completely re-login again. This is a setting, which can be configured in your Salesforce org:\nCheck Setup --> Security --> \"Session Settings\" --> check if \"Force relogin after Login-As-User\" is unchecked"
