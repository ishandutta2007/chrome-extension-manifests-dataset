You can view the daily funding chart directly on the Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign page. \n\nAS A BACKER, you can see if your favorite projects are on track to meet their funding goal. You can also sign into BackerKit and see if you have surveys that require your attention in a bar above the Kickstarter project pages you visit. \n\nAS A CREATOR, after you launch your campaign, you can see a trend projection for the remainder of your campaign to see if it is on track to meet its funding goal. \n\nOur projection model compares a projectâ€™s funding curve and backer count against the historical performance of past projects to find all campaigns that had similar performance over the same number of days. The model finds the median performance of those similar projects to plot a projection trend through the remainder of the campaign."
