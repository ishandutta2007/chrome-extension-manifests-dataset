We think that’s a problem. We’re on a mission to make the law easy, dispute resolution faster and our society fairer. That’s why we built technology to solve this problem. \n\nCourtCorrect pulls the most important information about money, data and anything unusual out of the terms of products linked to sites you visit. While browsing the web, the icon will light up and display the number of products it has found for the site you are currently on. You can then check the main terms of the site to make sure you're always in control of what you're doing with your money and data."
