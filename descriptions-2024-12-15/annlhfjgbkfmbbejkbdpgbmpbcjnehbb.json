All you have to do is click the \"save\" button that appears below snippets or just select text anywhere and right-click to save! You can organize your code in collections and access it anytime from the web hosted on thiscodeworks.com.\n\nThis extension syncs with the web app and Visual Studio Code extension. You can also share your snippets as a link, image, or embeddable HTML iframe.\n\n(If you come across some bugs or issues, please let us know right away at info@thiscodeworks.com. Thanks!)"
