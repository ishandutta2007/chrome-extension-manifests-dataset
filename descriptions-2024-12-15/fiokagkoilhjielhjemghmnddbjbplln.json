It was easier in old UX, but with the new UX, a lot of garbage is copied as well. They have a copy link button, but that wasn't really useful for me. I wrote this extension out of frustration, which adds a standalone button next to the JIRA ID, to save you from the hassle. Feel free to give it a try.\n\nI try my best to keep it updated to latest and also support old versions of JIRA. In case it does not work for you create an issue at https://github.com/AdeshAtole/copy-jira-id/issues/new OR drop a mail"
