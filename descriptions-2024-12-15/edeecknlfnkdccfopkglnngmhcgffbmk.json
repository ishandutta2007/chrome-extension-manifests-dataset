No more guessing how many bids a competing bidder has placed on the auction, just simply open up an auction and let this software do the rest.  It will show you the current bid count for each bidder for as long as you have the auction open.\n\nIf you close out an auction and revisit it, it will pick up where it left off (but cannot track bids placed by bidders while you were away from the auction).  The first step in winning more auctions on DashDeals (it's called DealDash actually, but it's a common typo) is to know how many bids your competitors have placed.\n\nSo go ahead and arm yourself with a powerful new tool on DashDeals...it's completely free and will surely help you on your way to winning more auctions."
