Then, review your content, and click “post.” \n\nThat’s it. Only a few seconds, and your post will be instantly published! \n\n-- Settings -- \n\nJust enter your WordPress URL, username and password, and you’re good to go. \n\n~~ WP version 3.8 and above ~~\n\nThis extension has been tested with Wordpress version 3.8.
