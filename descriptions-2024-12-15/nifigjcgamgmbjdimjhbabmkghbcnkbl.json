Furthermore, it also allows users to freely Search, Close and Jump between Tabs without much efforts(e.g. Users may encounter difficulties in properly managing large number of opened Tabs as the Tabs shrinks smaller when it grows large in number). \n\nNow, we give the freedom of choice back to you to choose the Tabs you desire.\n\nThis extension also supports on all mobile tablets running on Windows operating system. \n\nCurrently supported features in this version:\n\n1) Jump to different Tabs by clicking at the icon of a website.\n2) Close any Tabs from your current Tab.\n3) Determining the Important Tabs(disables the Close Tab function to avoid closing tabs accidentally). \n\nFurther improvements will be added on the upcoming release updates. Currently, the developers are working on upgrading the features specified. So, stay tuned and help us to support by reviewing your comments and feedback.\n\nÂ©2013 by Ideators Corp.
