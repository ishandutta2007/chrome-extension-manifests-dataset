Just click the red icon with zb and you’ll get your citation. It keeps track of your recent references which you can clear anytime.\n\nI’m not associated with Zotero, they don’t have their own extension for ZoteroBib. I used the code posted in their forums under “ZoteroBib as a chrome extension” They do have their own free extension and tools for the more academic (heavy duty) Zotero and they’re awesome.  They provide zbib.org as a fast and simple version (just no extension).  There are other citation websites such as citation machine (which Purdue Owl uses), but I believe that zbib.org is better.\nHelp for Zoterobib is on the bottom of the page (zbib.org) and they have a great FAQ and user forums. \n\nHopefully this makes your writing a little easier."
