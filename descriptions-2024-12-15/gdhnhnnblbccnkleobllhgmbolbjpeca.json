This will kick off a new merge evaluation, which kicks off another build. And so on.\n\nHaving to sit and wait for this to go through and to remember to come back right after the build finished so that you can check in, is a real pain and wasted time.\n\nThe extension will click the re-evaluate button for you, wait until builds are finished, click the complete pull request button and will alert you to any problems."
