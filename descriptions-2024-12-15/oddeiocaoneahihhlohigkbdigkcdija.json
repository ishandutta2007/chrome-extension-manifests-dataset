By uniting calendars, docs, and tasks, Hugo makes it easy to share meeting agendas, collaborate in real-time, and ensure that actions don't slip through the cracks.\n\nFrom customer calls to team meetings to one-on-ones, Hugo unlocks an incomparable way to work, that equips people not only to run better meetings but to be better teammates who are the best at their jobs.\n\nIntegrations with Google Calendar, Slack, and other apps ensure that meeting outcomes can be seamlessly shared with colleagues, even if they're not Hugo users themselves.\n\nThe result is that people show up to meetings prepared, customer calls are more productive and teams know what’s happening whether or not they were in the same room.\n\nThe Hugo Chrome extension replaces your empty Chrome tab with a quick view into your upcoming meetings. It’s the perfect launchpad to prepare for and run your meetings.\n\nKEY HUGO FEATURES\n• 📝 Prepare agendas and write notes in your browser\n• ✅ Track tasks and action items\n• 💼 A library of 80+ agenda templates\n• 🚀 Quick access buttons on Google Calendar entries\n\nCOMMITMENT TO PRIVACY\nBecause Hugo connects to your calendar data, we’ve made sure it’s the safest place for your meeting knowledge. \n\n• 🕵️‍♀️ Private. Your data is private, accessible only by you (or your team with your permission).\n• 💂‍♀️ Safe. Permissions to read and change site data allow the extension to work, not track you.\n• 🔒 Encrypted. All information is encrypted during transit and storage.\n\nPRICING\nHugo is **free** for individuals and small teams. The Pro plan starts at $6/user/month.\n\nLearn more at www.hugo.team"
