IT ONLY SHOWS YOU LINKS. You cannot tweet or read your @replies. There are no Twitter Cards, Favorite links or follower counts. Tweets in your timeline have no attribution - neither profile photos nor usernames. In fact, you cannot view any tweets which do not contain links.\n\nWhile Twitter.com truncates external links within your timeline, SelfishTwit shows you the full URL. If you want to bypass Instagram or Foursquare links to get to the news or longform writing you want, viewing the full URL really helps. Many CMSes also include a blog post’s full title at the end of its URL path, so SelfishTwit can even function as an slightly garbled headline scanner.\n\nWhen you hover over a link, you can also see the full tweet that link belongs to. It’s a good way to get context if you’re not certain what a link leads to."
