With this Chrome extension, you can generate unique screen recording request links to send to your customers with one click.\n\nCustomers can then use your unique link to record their screens without having to download/install anything. Once they're done recording, the video is saved for you to review and you're notified by email.\n\nIt's an ideal way to solve complex customer support issues, without having to get on a screen sharing call or have a back-and-forth email exchange."
