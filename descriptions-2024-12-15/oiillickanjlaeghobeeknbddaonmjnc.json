Please join us in our mission of making the legal system more equitable and competitive.\n\n - If you use PACER, this free extension will save you money. Every document you purchase will be uploaded to the \"RECAP Archive\" and every document others have purchased since 2009 will be available to you for free as you use PACER.\n\n - You can use this extension to create email alerts for federal dockets.\n\n - This extension has already added millions of federal filings to the Internet Archive and to a searchable archive at https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/. \n\n - As of 2021, we have nearly 500 tons of filings, if they were all printed on single-sided paper.\n\n - The more people that use this extension, the more money we all save. Help your friends by uploading content and tell them to install RECAP for you too.\n\nRECAP has four main features. First, when you purchase an item on PACER, RECAP anonymously uploads that item to our archive hosted at https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/ where it can be searched or downloaded for free by others. \n\nSecond, before you purchase an item that is in our collection, a link will be provided for you — right inside PACER — to get it for free. Any of the millions of items that have been uploaded so far are already available to you for free.\n\nThird, as you're looking at dockets on PACER, you'll see links to get alerts for those dockets via our website, CourtListener.com.\n\nFinally, allows you to search our archive from your browser URL bar by using the \"recap\" shortcut.\n\nAll of the items that you purchase are also uploaded to the Internet Archive for historical preservation. We are not creating a walled garden.\n\nRECAP is compatible with ECF logins and will not upload documents from sealed cases.\n\nLearn more at https://free.law/recap/"
