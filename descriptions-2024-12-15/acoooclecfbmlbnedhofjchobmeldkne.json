Various news sources are taking advantage of that by linking to sources, but it's not always clear that they're linking to external sources.  It's even less clear whether they're linking to trustworthy external sources.\n\nThis project has a few goals:\n\n1. Make it clear whether a news article links to any external sources that readers can use to independently verify that the news is being reported accurately.\n2. Highlight the links to those sources\n\nIcons made by Eucalyp from www.flaticon.com"
