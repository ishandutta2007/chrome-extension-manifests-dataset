The artist reflects, \"I believe the reason we’re captivated by songbirds is because we see the magic in their flight and their ability to find home in different places, something we sought to do for ourselves after the Vietnam War.\" \n\nKhôi Phạm is a Saigon-born, Brooklyn-based Vietnamese artist. His works investigate and distort the quiet vibration within the mundane. Drawing inspiration from everyday objects, Khôi amplifies these items, expanding their meaning and presence past the obvious."
