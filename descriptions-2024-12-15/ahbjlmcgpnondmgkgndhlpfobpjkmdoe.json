There is a niche internet hobby where people modify the html of these boxes to make alternate timeline wikiboxes. My brother and his friends are really into it, so I made this chrome extension to help them.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Right click on an element to change it's color easily (great for borders below portraits on election boxes)\n- Select a range of text and change it's color easily with right click\n- Election map creation tool in the Options menu\n- Automatically calculate the popular vote, seat total, and percentage for an election map\n- Sliders for each state to set how split the vote was, adjust popular vote percentage accordingly.\n- Save and load map SVG files to edit later\n- Find and replace text on a wikipedia page (case sensitive)\n- A clear visited links button in the right click menu that resets all link styles."
