This extension remains fully supported, but will remain on MV2 as long as possible to retain support for older Chromebooks and oppose other issues with MV3 highlighted by the EFF – https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation.\n―\n\nBy default, certain parts of Discord's interface, such as emoji reaction buttons, can be difficult to tap on a touch screen.  This extension makes them larger and easier to touch.\n\nThe Discord team has improved a lot of things in the past few years, such as the “⋮“ menus on individual messages, so the changes with this extension are less drastic than they were at launch, but I will continue updating this extension until the entire interface is touch-friendly.\n\nDeveloped by Zachary Yaro - ZMYaro.com.\nThe source code is available at github.com/ZMYaro/discord-touch.\nThe apps and extensions I develop are supported in part through donations on ko-fi.com/ZMYaro and patreon.com/ZMYaro."
