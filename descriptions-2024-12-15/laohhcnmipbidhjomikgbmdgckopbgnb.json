Launch it before you get down to a task, select the time limit and choose how you want to be notified when you’ve run out of time.\n\nThe stopwatch and timer come together in a simple extension featuring a sleek no-frills design. Ultra timer can work in both online and offline modes.\n\nThe timer can be set for any number of minutes up to 999 which makes it possible to use it for different timeboxing methods including “pomodoro technique”.\n\nWhen the time is up, you’ll either hear a timer alarm or see a notification from the countdown timer. It’s that simple."
