Ever wondered to yourself, \"How could I go back in time and see how this page used to be?\"\n\nThe Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/web/) is a massive repository of snapshots of web pages over time. It provides a way to do just the kind of time-travel you have always longed for. But it is annoying to have to navigate to https://archive.org/web/ and then paste in the URL of the website you're interested in searching for. This extension enables you to do just that in one click!"
