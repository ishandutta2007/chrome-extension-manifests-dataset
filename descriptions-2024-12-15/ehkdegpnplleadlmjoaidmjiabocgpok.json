DynamicHistory will scan every website you visit and remove any pages containing the word 'bad-history' from your history.\n\nThe filters can be modified in the extension preferences.\n\nAny page that will not keep history will have a red border around it along with it's tab's name changed, if you do not see this on a page you specified to not be tracked, check your filters again! These indicators can be toggled in the extension preferences.\n\nYou can click on the DynamicHistory icon to access the extension preferences.\n\nCookies and cache data WILL NOT be removed. The page may also appear on the recently visited page or also in the recently closed tabs list (if the page is closed) so be careful!\n\nDynamicHistory can also modify history entries as they are being added. You can use this to do crazy things like turn all your history entries into \"Rick Roll\" links.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nDynamicHistory does not function properly with Chrome's history sync enabled. Instructions to disable history sync will pop up after you install DynamicHistory."
