It can be used both to answer clickbait titles or summarize informative articles. Makes the browsing experience less annoying.\nOpen source, check it out on github: https://github.com/marksverdhei/save-me-a-click-chrome-extension\n\nHow to use:\n\nFor a first time setup, you will need an OpenAI api key. Here are the steps to obtain one if you don't have one already:\n\n1. Create an account at https://openai.com/\n2. Register your account as a paid account https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview (free trial does not work)\n3. Create a new API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys (copy it and save it somewhere)\nThis currently only works for paid accounts (ass opposed to free-trial accounts)\n\nNow that you have obtained the api key, simply click the icon of the extension in the top right corner of your browser, and paste in the key, then click save.\n\nFor your own usage, save me a click should be very cheap in terms of api costs,\nbut we recommend setting a hard limit of your usage costs here: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits (e.g. of $1)"
