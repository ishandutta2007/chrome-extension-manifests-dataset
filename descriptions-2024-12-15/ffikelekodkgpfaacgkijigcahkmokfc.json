By enabling request tracking, up to 200 Mapp Intelligence track-requests can be listed in the popup window.\n\nFeel free to configure the request list fitting to your needs. Use predefined filters for various request types (teaser, product, events, media and more) or a custom RegEx.\n\nSet the parameters that are displayed for every single request – click on a request to see a table with all parameters and their available values.\n\nUsage examples:\n\n- Enable the decoupled window mode so the window does not disappear when you click on a link and load a new page\n\nor\n\n- Open the window on a browser tab, and monitor the request from a second screen.\n\nThe Mapp Cloud Debugger provides a special debug mode for Mapps Smart Pixel technology. Enable the debug mode in the Smart Pixel, and you will see all method calls of Smart Pixel in the JavaScript console. You can even add the stack trace – this way you can easily find out which data is being tracked.\n\nIf you have Mapps Marketing Automation implemented on your site, the Mapp Cloud Debugger can help you review running campaigns. Highlight custom HTML containers and re-trigger recommendations and Audience Streams."
