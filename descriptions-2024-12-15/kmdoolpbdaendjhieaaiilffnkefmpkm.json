This extension allows you to keep a folder of webcomics updated with two clicks each time you stop reading. \n\nAn example morning for me involved going to xkcd, scrolling back to the last one I read, then reading from then on. That was annoying and took far too many clicks, so I wrote this extension to help. Now I just go to my bookmarks folder, click xkcd and I'm on the last one I read. When I read through as many as I have time for I can just right click and save my place for the next day.\n\nIf you don't have a folder named \"Comics\" in your bookmarks bar it will create one when Chrome loads, this may require you to restart Chrome. From then on it will update that spot in the folder each time you update your saved page.\n\n------------------------------------\nKnown issues have been fixed. Let me know if you find anything new."
