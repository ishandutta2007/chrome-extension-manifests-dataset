That’s why Tangata Whenua have created Pīkari Mai, a plugin designed to shut up the headline-hungry royal family.\n\nPīkari Mai rids the internet of royal articles by replacing them with the latest Māori news drawn from a range of local media publishers. Honouring Kaituhi Māori (indigenous writers) by prioritising news stories written by, for and about indigenous people."
