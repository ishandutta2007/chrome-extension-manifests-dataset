AnkiTab gives you a selection of flashcards each time a new tab is opened, allowing you to mix in tiny chunks of card reviewing through the day, which leads to a more lightweight and productive learning.\n\nFeaturing built-in deck interleaving, which has been scientifically proved to improve the learning process [1][2][3][4].\n\nThe extension is totally open source and all the code is licensed under The Unlicense, which is extremely permissive. The code repository can be found at https://github.com/corollari/ankiTab.\n\nIf you find any issue/bug or want to request any feature, email me at ankitab@albert.sh or create an issue on github.\n\n[1] Pan, Steven C.
