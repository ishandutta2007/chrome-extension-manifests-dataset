Dynamic elements are any aspects of a webpage that may not be displayed immediately as the page loads, such as an image slider, dropdown menu, or questionnaire. These elements are usually JavaScript-based and may require some user interaction.\n \nYou can browse your site and drop hints along the way with Hintify mode. Right click on anything you want to add a hint to and the Veeva Web2PDF Chrome extension automatically translates your clicks into hint actions that you can easily preview by generating a PDF directly from the Chrome extension. These hints are saved locally to your computer and you can share them with others by downloading a .json file from the Hint Tab. You can also download your hints as a .js file to make them permanent on your website via touchless hints.\n \nTo learn more, please visit https://www.veevaweb2pdf.com."
