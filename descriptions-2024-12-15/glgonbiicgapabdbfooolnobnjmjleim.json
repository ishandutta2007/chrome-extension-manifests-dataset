It works not only on addresses but also on city names, neighborhood names, and zip codes.\n\nBy default, the extension pops up a small summary window displaying just the walk, transit, and bike score badges. You can click through to the full detailed view from there.\n\nYou may configure the extension to skip the summary popup window and load the full Walk Score page directly into a new window or tab instead.\n\nIf you will be searching in only one city, you may also configure the extension to always qualify searches with that city name. This expands the functionality of the extension so it can cope more impressively with incomplete addresses and unqualified neighborhood names.\n\nFor more details see the README file on the GitHub repo:\nhttps://github.com/sarahhagstrom/chrome-walkscore/blob/master/README.md"
