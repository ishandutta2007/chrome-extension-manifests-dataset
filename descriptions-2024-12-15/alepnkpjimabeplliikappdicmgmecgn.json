Your goal is to move the red dot along the white path to the orange exit without hitting the blue borders or the moving paddles. A timer at the top shows how much time you've spent on each level.\n\nThe big difference in the pro version is the moving black paddles. These paddles move up and down, with random initial heights. Their starting positions are fixed at the beginning but bounce off the top and bottom edges of the game area and switch directions. The paddles can even overlap, making it tricky to predict their movementsâ€”this adds more challenge.\n\nThere are 10 levels, and they get harder as you go. After finishing one level, you'll move to the next. Once you complete all levels, you can see how much time you took. If you fail a level, the game restarts automatically on current level, and you can use the reset button to go back to level one whenever you want.\n\nTo start the game, just click the extension icon in the top-right corner of your browser, and the game will pop up right away. Be ready to avoid those moving paddles and beat all the levels!"
