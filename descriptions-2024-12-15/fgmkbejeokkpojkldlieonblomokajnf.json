I'm not sure exactly when this will happen, but at some point soon, POTD will no longer receive new documents.\n\nI hope you had some magical discovery moments opening new tabs with us over the last few years.\n\nThank you to everyone who supported me on this journey. It was a lot of fun.\n\n-----\nPaper of the day is a fantastic way for you to get a glimpse of different trending academic articles from a range of disciplines from the comfort of your browser. Make each new tab opened the start of a beautiful intellectual journey.\n\n--------------\n*TESTIMONIALS*\n\n\"Finding new computer science papers has never been so MUCH fun!\" - Data scientist in the Mendeley Office, 2019\n\n\"I downloaded it as a productivity app, but really it's an excuse to see what pretty pictures the app pairs with random academic papers.\" -  Mendeley Product Manager, 2019"
