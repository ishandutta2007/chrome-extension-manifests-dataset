If you’re new to Replay, install at replay.io to get started.\n\nCurrently only supported in MacOS.\n\nWhat is Replay?\n\nReplay is an application recorder, time travel debugger, and powerful developer collaboration tool, all in one. Replay lets you record a browser session to produce a shareable replay for collaborative debugging. The replay isn’t just a video — everything from the browser is recorded so you can inspect everything including HTML elements, JavaScript execution, network requests, user events, and even the state of your React components at each and every moment in time.\n\nUsing the Extension\n\n1. Whenever you are ready to record, click the Replay extension icon in the browser toolbar, then select “Record this website.” Note: The Replay Browser must be installed before recording. You can also install the browser from the extension.\n2. The first time you record a new site, the browser will prompt you to allow opening the browser. Select the checkbox to prevent this step next time, then click “Open Replay”.\n3. The Replay Browser will launch to the exact URL already open in Chrome and begin recording automatically. From here, record and share as you normally would!\n\nGet support and share feedback at replay.io/discord.\n\nWhen to use Replay\n\nThere is a lot of information packed in each replay, so the possibilities are extensive. Replay is primarily used by developers to reproduce and debug issues with web applications.\n\nSome common uses cases include:\n\n- Recording bugs in development to share with a team\n- QA or Test Engineer defect reports\n- Recording automated tests in CI to easily debug failures\n- Reproducing user issues to submit bug reports for Support\n- Documenting pull requests"
