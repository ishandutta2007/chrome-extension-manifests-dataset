We've all been at that point where we have 20+ tabs open not knowing exactly why, but also too afraid to close any of them. This extension aims to address that problem with the simple solution of giving the users a little bit more control over their research! \nQuickly add notes to tabs in the Sticky Tab interface, choose a color and bang! context for your open tabs, simply hover over the tab and reveal the full note.\nRespects theme colors and notes clear on browser refresh.\nIf you research or constantly have dozens of tabs open this tool is for you!"
