Its main purpose is to forward printing commands generated by the web application to the desktop application and acquire their result. \nOn the extensionâ€™s options, the local http address of a service running in the desktop application is stored. The extension uses this address to forward the printing commands to it. \nThis extension makes no changes to your browser. \nAnyone who runs the Epsilon Net's web applications and wishes to forward the printing of documents directly to a local printer, should install this extension."
