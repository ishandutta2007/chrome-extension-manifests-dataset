This timeline based plugin helps you view any thread that has more than 3 emails in an intuitive way. Select a thread in Gmail, and the timeline loads up as an overlay which you can then use to navigate to any conversation from that particular thread. \nThe timeline displays dates on which emails have been exchanged. The numbers above each date denote how many messages have been exchanged on that day. The dots on the timeline are clickable. The orange dot indicates the selected date. Clicking on the green dot will take you to the very first email in the thread.\n\nClick on any message in the list view to see it open in the background (gmail) panel. Clicking in on the message body to then reply/forward, etc. automatically minimises the Thrdzz panel. \n\nSelect a participant name at the top to filter and see conversations only from that user. \nEasily find attachments and additional information of when someone was added to the thread \n\nThrdzz aims to make email threads the productive feature it was always meant to be. Go ahead, start using it and experience the change in the way you deal with threaded communication."
