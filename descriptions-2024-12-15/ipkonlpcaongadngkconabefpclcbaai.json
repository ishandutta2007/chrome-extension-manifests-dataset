If the listed price is $9.99, for example, Shopperman will round it up to $10.00. \n\nHOW SHOPPERMAN WILL SAVE YOU MONEY: charm pricing is a marketing strategy where retail prices are often expressed a little less than a round number, e.g. $19.99 or $2.95. Consumers tend to perceive “odd prices” as being significantly lower than they actually are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit. Thus, prices such as $1.99 are associated with spending $1 rather than $2. Now, with Shopperman, you will valuate a merchandise at its true value rather than falling into marketing gimmicks. \n\nYou can choose which websites Shopperman will work on. It does not round up prices without your permission!"
