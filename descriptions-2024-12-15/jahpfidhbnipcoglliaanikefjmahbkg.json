The Best Gift Site (https://www.thebestgiftsite.com/) lets users create as many universal wish lists as they like, on to which they can add items from any store.  Wish lists can be created for any occasion, and can be private, if you want to keep a reminder of gifts for others or for yourself later.\n\nThe Best Gift Site Browser Extension makes adding items to existing wish lists, from online stores, as simple as pressing a couple of buttons.  If you see an item you would like to add to a wish list, just click on The Best Gift Site icon, which will bring up a small window.  Here you can select an image to be added to your wish list, check the price, update the quantity and add any specific requirements, such as size and colour, before selecting the wish list(s) on to which you want to add the item.  Easy! To use this extension, users must have already registered for an account on The Best Gift Site (https://www.thebestgiftsite.com/) and created at least one wish list.\n\nAlthough you can add items without this extension, it makes adding items so much easier.  You can also check out the site’s Gift Inspiration page, to see if there is anything there that you like.\n\nThe Best Gift Site is currently only in English, but we will be looking to expand in time.\n\nAs for privacy, when users register for an account at The Best Gift Site, they are asked to provide some personal details so that any wish lists they create can be assigned to their account, such as their name, contact details, date of birth, Country and Gender.  The content of wish lists are used to make recommendation on trending items.  The demographic data is also used to make gift recommendation for specific demographics.  No user identifiable data or contact details are shared by the site.  Creators of wish lists can, of course, share their wish lists with others.  Contact details may be used by The Best Gift Site Team to remind users that a friend’s Occasion is due shortly, or to inform users of specific deals relevant to their wish list or a wish list they are following. \n\nThe Best Gift Site Extension is also available for Chrome, Edge and Safari."
