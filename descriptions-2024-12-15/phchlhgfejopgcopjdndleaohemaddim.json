There are currently no plans to update it.)\n\nThis extension attempts to make Newgrounds (www.newgrounds.com) more SFW by filtering out more stuff related to mature content, and makes other small changes so that you know where you're going within Newgrounds. It does NOT block any content itself or remove it from view, only thumbnails of mature and adult content are affected. This is so you don't encounter these types of thumbnails if you don't want to.\n\nThe extension is customizable. You can choose to filter only a-rated items instead, you can choose to only block specific pages on Newgrounds.\n\nNaturally, if there are any user suggestions I'm all ears. Leave a review here or a comment on the relevant page on my website, or PM me (bcdefg123) on Newgrounds.\n\nI do not own Newgrounds, I am just a user. The extension is subject to break at any time if the site changes. Also be aware that the content on NG is self-rated, meaning things might still get through that this extension would otherwise address."
