An ever increasing number of companies use censorship to harm others. These practices take many forms. They can stop you from earning a living or participating in the digital public square.\n\nThe Alternatives To Big Tech extension helps you fight back against corporate censorship!\n\nIt notifies you when you visit a website with a history of censorship. Then offers alternative companies for you to consider.\n\nStop the censorship and hit the big guys where it hurts most â€“ their wallets."
