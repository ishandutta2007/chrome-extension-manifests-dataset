Not endorsed by or affiliated with Percussion Software.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nSkip2Edit\nSkips straight to edit page when you double click a page within Editor.\n\nSave Scroll\nRestores your scroll position after saving a page or template.\n\nAlso includes an options page to toggle features on and off individually (accessible from the icon, or from your Chrome Extensions list at chrome://extensions).\n\nA NOTE ABOUT PERMISSIONS: Although Chrome will tell you it can access any website you visit, it's actually restricted to pages which match the URL structure of Percussion. We could not restrict it by domain because, aside from CM1 SaaS customers, Percussion installations are self-hosted, on a variety of different domains."
