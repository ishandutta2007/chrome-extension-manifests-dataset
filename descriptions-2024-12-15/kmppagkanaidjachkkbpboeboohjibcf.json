When we find the energy pursue our big ambition, we often find ourselves alone, filled with self-doubt, wondering if this might only ever be something we dream about.\n\n37SevenEight is for those people who are saying this time it's going to be different!\n\nThe chrome extension acts as an accountability buddy, keeping that thing you most want in front of you.\n\nUsing two simple journal prompts, what have you done? And what will you do? The tool encourages daily reflection and intention setting that is proven to help build momentum and progress towards goals.\n\nThe witness feature is a wonderful way to be seen and celebrated by those that motivate you. Use it to add a friend, partner or coach so that they are notified whenever you complete a reflection.\n\nI hope you get as much value from this tool as I have. Please reach out if you have any questions or feedback.\n\n- Ray\n\n---\nInformation about the extension:\nThe chrome extension displays the 37.78 prompt cards when you open a new tab in your browser.
