This widget is a small special window that stays in the foreground even when you minimize Chrome. It displays your portfolio value by the asset or the total in a chart and figures that are updated every second.\n\nInstructions:\n\nWhen you open eToro you will see a button on the top right of the screen that opens the widget. The widget can only collect data while you are on the portfolio overview. The tab does not have to be active, however, and Chrome can be minimized. The widget will still stay in the foreground, display and work properly.\n\nTo reset the data in the widget click into the chart -- as shown on the screenshot.\n\nPlease leave a rating!\n\nRelease Notes:\n\n1.6 [2024-10-06]\n  1 - Detailed Mode! Track your portfolio by the asset in the live diagram!\n\n1.5 [2024-10-03]\n  1 - Fixed tracking system theme immediately\n\n1.4 [2024-10-03]\n  1 - Dark Mode\n  2 - \"Reset\" overlay stuck fixed by closing it after 1 second\n\n1.3 [2024-03-01]\n  1 - Display currency and monetary change per hour in info bar\n  2 - \"Reset\" overlay is now animated and the overlay getting stuck is mostly fixed\n      (unfortunately not 100%, however, due to a Chrome issue)"
