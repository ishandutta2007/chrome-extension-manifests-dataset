When you receive a feed notification alerting you of a new message, group invitation, follower, or anything else, a desktop notification appears, allowing you to instantly take action.\n\n## WHY DO I NEED IT? ##\nThe Soundation Community is a tremendous feature, and one of the best parts of the site. One thing it lacks is a truly practical notifications system. The site will display a summary of new messages, follows, invitations, and memberships, but these are visible only within the site. Modation delivers these notifications to you immediately, adding an accessible, seemless experience without sacrificing usability.\n\nModation also improves the Soundation website itself by offering user tagging, group list filtering, a more accessible comments box on tracks and groups, and other Community improvements. Each of these mods can be toggled on or off via the options page, accessible from the popup window on the toolbar icon. This popup also shows some quick actions for showing or clearing all current notifications, and the icon itself will show the number of unread notifications. \n\nRead more here: https://djmarcolesco.me/modation"
