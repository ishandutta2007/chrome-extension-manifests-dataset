After installation you will be able to see the data from your Intercom customers right inside your Gmail. Data such as location, company name, monthly spending, tags, social profiles, your notes, etc. is pulled for each customer from your Intercom account. \n\nThe benefit of this extension is that when you open an email in Gmail sent by a customer, you can see the customer profile on the right panel next to the email. This extension has functionalities similar to Rapportive for LinkedIn in showing user profiles. \n\nAfter installation, you must first set your Intercom API credentials (App ID and API Key) in the settings. You can find these informations by going to your Intercom account; then go to \"Integrations\"; and then go to \"API Keys\".  \n\nRequirements: You need to have an Intercom and Gmail account."
