You'll be able to click to the methods, variables or classes and go to their definitions, and also click to the declarations to find out where they are used at. It works both for the tree views and pull requests, so whenever someone sends you a pull request, you'll be able to review it more efficiently, since you actually can click on the methods and see where they come from.\n\nYou can check https://github.com/astashov/crosshub-chrome-extension for instructions how to add it to your TypeScript project and for the source code."
