Wouldn't it be nice if there was an easy way to specify your preferred payment information and for it to be a platform that doesn't take 30% of the donations you receive? That's what this extension is all about.\n\nPayCreators is a small extension that works in two steps:\n\n1. Creators add a small meta tag on their websites with payment methods information\n2. The extension reads that information and display it to the person browsing the page\n\nThis way, people can easily identify ways to tip and donate to content creators in a fast and non-invasive way. No need for distracting pop-ups or banners.\n\nPayCreators currently supports these payment methods:\n\n- Buy Me a Coffee\n- Crowdfundly\n- Ko-fi\n- Patreon\n- Paypal\n- Tipeee\n- Venmo"
