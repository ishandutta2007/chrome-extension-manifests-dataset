Through the right-click menu you can search for an individual term, or translate an entire page of jargon all at once. It's brought to you by the Signal Cartel corporation and it's automagical!\n\nEntire page translation: will auto-replace jargon on the current web page with plain language. ie: MWD will be replaced with MWD (Microwarp Drive). This option, however, does not replace every term it finds. There are many more terms in the dictionary than are used in the full-page translation. This also does not provide the full definitions. For other terms, or to get a more in-depth definition, use the single term lookup.\n\nSingle term lookup: by selecting any term and right clicking, you can look up the term in the NEWB dictionary and get the full definition if one exists.\n\nIf you have suggestions, or comments on NEWB, come visit us on the Signal Cartel public forums at https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/6346/new-tool-to-help-new-eve-pilots or send me an email directly."
