We reduce the amount of time you spend answering repetitive employee questions by helping  surface quick answers from your HR docs. Simply point us at your employee handbooks, benefits information and policies anywhere they live and instantly be able to ask questions against them. \n\nYou can use Winslow through our web app or directly inside Gmail with our Chrome Extension. In Gmail, Winslow automatically extracts questions from employees emails and suggests not only the correct information related to their question but also provides a complete email response you can use to reply.  Common email responses can be edited, saved, and shared with your HR team to standardize communications. \n\nWinslow also provides you cross-team visibility into the questions being asked by category and theme so you can identify proactive training or new policy opportunities. \n\nAt Winslow, our singular goal is to reduce the time you and your team spends on necessary but low-value activities so you can focus on strategic initiatives for your company and employees again."
