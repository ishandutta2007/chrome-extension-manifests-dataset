Long-term goal is an extension which provides a very clean almost text based experience for the amazing Google Play Music app. \n\nThis initial versions is being pushed out to serve a very specific need. My daughter only falls asleep to a specific playlist, but the way Google Play Music renders on my laptop, I can never find the playlist that I need. By hiding the REDUNDANT 'Recent Activity' panel from the Library page, I can easily access this content."
