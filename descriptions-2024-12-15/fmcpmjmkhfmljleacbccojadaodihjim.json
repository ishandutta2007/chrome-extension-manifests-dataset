But how do you know somebody is waiting for your review? Constantly check the list of reviews assigned to you? Never miss an annoying message from a Slack bot? Traffic light icon in the Chrome toolbar is the solution. When it's red just click on it as soon as you're ready to spend some time on reviews.\n\nIt's open-source. You can build it yourself and add to Chrome manually, see https://github.com/artie-shevchenko/pr-review-your-turn?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started"
