Analytics Tracker is a devtool and will be available in the developer tools after installation. It adds a new tab in the developer tools by the name 'Google Analytics'. You can view it by More tools -> Developer Tools from the Chrome Menu. Hit the Start recording button to start tracking the analytics data. You can now start browsing/using the website generally and it will show you all the data that the site is logging via analytics. You can stop/restart/clear this data at any point. \nThis extension can also be used by developers to validate if they have covered all checkpoints for logging data to analytics and test out the logging as a user."
