It works with Google Docs but not with the right-click option or with the keyboard shortcut because Google Docs blocks those from working. Here are the instructions for Google Docs:\n1. In Google Docs, select the text to copy.\n2. Click on the extension icon â§‰ on the Chrome toolbar\n3. Click on the \"Copy as Plain Text...\" button in the popup.\n4. Paste in the program of your choice. It will preserve new lines.\n\nDoes it work with PDFs in the browser?\nYes! It works with PDF files in the browser if you are using Google Chrome's default PDF Viewer. However, it will not preserve line feeds and the user has to use the right-click context menu > Copy as Plain Text... > Copy as Plain Text... It will not work with a keyboard shortcut or the button in the popup with PDFs.  In other cases, the PDF viewer used or the PDF file may have a security policy that doesn't even allow the right-click context menu to read any data. If that is the case, and the PDF allows copying of rich text, then an option is the in-app purchase for the button in the pop-up called \"Convert Clipboard to Plain Text\".\n\nWhere is the extension icon on the Chrome toolbar?\nIf you can't find the extension icon  on the Chrome toolbar then following these instructions:\n1. Click on the \"Extensions\" icon ðŸ§© that looks like a jigsaw puzzle piece in the top right corner of the browser toolbar.\n2.
