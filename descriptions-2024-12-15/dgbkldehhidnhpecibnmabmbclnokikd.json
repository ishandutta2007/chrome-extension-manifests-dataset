Our reviews provide an overall score and recommendations to optimize the page for search engines. While you can see the review of any web page, Site SEO Analysis is intended to be used by webmasters and content managers for their own pages. If you wish to analyze an entire website, you should create an account and add the website to that account.\n\nWhy Use Site SEO Analysis?\nIf you maintain a website, there is really no good reason not to use Site SEO Analysis. The worst thing that can happen is that our search engine optimization analysis tells you that you have already perfectly optimized your website, which in turn might put a smile on your face. If we see room for improvement, you can utilize our recommendations to better optimize the web page for search engines. Greater optimization usually leads to higher rankings in the search results, which is also likely to put a smile on your face. With that logic, using Site SEO Analysis cannot only help you rank higher in the search results, but it can also put a smile on your face and a sense of accomplishment on your back.\n\nHow Does The SEO Analysis Work?\nOur SEO review consists of several factors like a site’s architecture, content, linking structure, social media efforts, and its trust on the internet. After analyzing these factors, we generate a summary and a detailed SEO Analysis. The SEO Summary provides an overall score and important recommendations to better optimize the web page for search engines. In the SEO Analysis, we break down the overall score into SEO elements and their own properties. Each property is given a color code that represents how well it is optimized. If it receives less than a perfect score, you will see at least one recommendation on how to improve this property. Using Site SEO Analysis’s recommendations, you should be able to optimize any of the web pages on a website and rank higher in search engine results."
