The memes can be created by adding text on the image. \n\nIf available, the information about the source image, such as  the owner of that image and any licensing restrictions will be displayed. You can use that information to ensure that your image wonâ€™t violate any copyrights and honor the restrictions set by the original owner. \n\nAfter creating your meme,  you can attach a Creative Commons License and share the meme on the Web. Currently the tool supports sharing on http://imgur.com, http://photorm.org and http://imagehare.com. You need to be authenticated via Google credentials before uploading to photorm and imagehare, but anonymous uploads for imgur should work by default.\n\nThe tool also supports auditing any resources that you have contributed to the Web! You can check who has viewed, downloaded and shared your images on websites that support a special data and usage restriction handling protocol called HTTPA."
