However, if you use ChromeOS these shortcuts are not available to you. This tiny, unobtrusive extension fixes that.\n\nShortcuts\n\n  Move active tab left - ctrl-shift-pgup\n  Move active tab right - ctrl-shift-pgdn\n  Move active tab to first position - ctrl-shift-1\n  Move active tab to last position - ctrl-shift-9\n  Move active tab to nth position - ctrl-shift-<2..8>\n\nChangelog\n\nv2.01\n - Fixed for Mac\n\nv2.0\n  - Manifest v3 support\n  - Only needed on Chrome OS now!\n\nv1.7 Thanks Yonathon Randolph!\n  - Listen on keydown instead of keyup\n  - Update to manifest verison 2\n  - Prevent events from reaching webpage\n  - Minor code cleanup\n\nF.A.Q.\n\n  Q:  It's not working on this page!\n  A:  Please note that NO Chrome extensions with a content script (such as this) are allowed to run in the Google Chrome Webstore (i.e. this page!) \n\n  Q:  It's not working on other pages!\n  A:  Tabs you had open prior to installing this extensions need to be reloaded before this will work. Otherwise check your org's policy on Chrome extension as it may be restricted by your administrator.\n\n\n  Q:  I sync my extensions across different Operating Systems. Will this break things on e.g. Windows?\n  A:  No. The extension does nothing on Linux to avoid ctrl-shift-pgup/down moving the tab twice.\n\n  Q:  Still having problems?\n  A:  Let me know and I will fix it. Don't make me ask for obvious details though. I would need browser version and operating system. Did you try it with no other extensions installed?"
