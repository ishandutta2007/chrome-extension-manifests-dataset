This extension makes using Policies even easier by adding an upload button to policy generators Termly.io, Formswift.com, and Getterms.io.\n\nYou will also need an account at https://policies.june07.com.  Once you have created an account the upload button inserted to the document generator site (termly.io for example) will directly upload your document to your Policies account and will then be hosted and under git control.\n\nSupport Issues can be opened on GitHub: https://github.com/june07/policies-extension\n\nAlso due to the delay with publishing to the store, the most up to date version can be downloaded directly from GitHub and installed by dropping into your extensions page.\n\nMost up to date version: https://github.com/june07/policies-extension/releases\n\nPlease go easy on the ratings and reach out to support before leaving any negative (less than 4) rating. Thanks kindly."
