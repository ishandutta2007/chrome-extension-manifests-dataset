While it's gathering reviews you will be able to see a number in a badge that represents exactly how many have been processed. In that zip file there will be a JSON file with a list of objects that represent a review.\n\n*NOTE* This chrome extension performs everything locally. There are no analytics and no round-trips to 3rd party servers. The extension will load a content_script for the play.google.com/apps/publish page, and nothing will leave your browser."
