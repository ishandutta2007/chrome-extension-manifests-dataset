Do it by hovering over the icon, clicking the dropdown arrow and picking the resolution. If the dropdown does not appear, it means there is no resolution choice for this video.\n\nIf you have a video which is password-protected, you can still download it with the extension. Do it by entering the password in the extension popup (appears after clicking the extension icon *in the extensions toolbar*). Best if you remove the password after you have downloaded the video.\n\nOn some videos it is possible to download the subtitles (captions). You can do it by choosing 'Captions' in the resolutions menu. This functionality is still in beta stage.\n\nIf you found a site where this extension isn't working, please check the following:\n1. Is the video you're trying to download in fact a Wistia video? Wistia videos usually allow you to right-click them and have an option 'About Wistia'.\n2. Are you using a VPN? Sometimes using a VPN prevents the extension from working properly.\n3. If you were using this extension to download Teachable videos, please note that that platform has recently switched away from Wistia, and so their videos can no longer be downloaded using this plugin.\n\nIf you're still having problems and the video can be publicly accessed, please share the link in the Support tab with a description of the problem and we will try to fix this."
