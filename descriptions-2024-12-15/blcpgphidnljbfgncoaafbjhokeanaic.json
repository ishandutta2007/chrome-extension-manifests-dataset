The extension offers a dark mode for ease on the eyes, and adjustable settings to control the number of links per row.\n\nThe 'Custom Link' functionality allows you to add personalized resources, complete with custom names, URLs, and colors. Moreover, you can review and manage any links you have removed, giving you complete control over your browsing experience.\n\nA standout feature is the real-time badge updater, synced with the EHHS school schedule. It keeps you updated about current and upcoming periods by displaying the remaining time on the extension's badge, changing color based on the time left.\n\nThere's also an integrated feedback system for users to voice their suggestions or concerns, promoting a user-centric experience. For convenience, a dedicated schedule section is available, letting you quickly glance at the day's layout.\n\nThe EHHS Chrome Extension is more than a tool; it's an indispensable companion for every EHHS student's digital journey."
