Once clicked, your color will give you it's Hexadecimal and RGB value. Along with that info, it will appear in your recent colors so that you can go back to it if you want later. If you did want to go back to a color in your most recent section, you can click on the box which will display all the information about that color again. \n\n**This extension is only compatible with Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. **\n\nSome buttons that come with the extensions are 'clear' and 'delete'. Clear button deletes all your recent colors while delete deletes the specific color you have selected."
