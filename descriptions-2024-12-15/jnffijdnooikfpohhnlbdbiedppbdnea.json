It will not transmit any information whatsoever. This extension cannot access user information or student information in any way. The extension only interacts with the url and the save button via javascript of instructure.com assignments pages.\n\nUsage:\nThe teacher must be logged in to an instructure.com account. If the user is on the instructure.com domain in assignments when the button is pressed, the url is checked for \"/edit\". If it's not found, javascript is used to remove GET variables and append \"/edit\" to the url. If it is found, javascript is used to press the \"Save\" button.\n\nChangelog:\nv0.2 - fine tuned url restriction for instructure.com extension will only work on canvas assignments."
