Start the same presentation in a second view, step on slide forward and synchronize both views. With each navigation step, the second view will stay one slide ahead. Tada - Preview!\n\nAdd more fancy to your presentation by feeding two projector views at the same time!\nRun translated versions in parallel, add captions and explanations, or just use a bigger projection space for more awsomeness - the sky is the limit! (well, actually it is the number of interfaces on your display adapter)\n\nAs an addon feature, syncs can autoplay your slideshows with configurable display time and loop point.\n\nUSAGE\n\nSyncs can be activated/deactivated for each browser tab individually by clicking the syncs icon. Activation will be indicated by a highlighted icon.\n\nAn active syncs extension will send keyboard and mouse events to all other browser tabs with active extension. \n\nOPTIONS\n\nRightclick the extension icon and choose \"options\" to enter syncs options to configure and operate the autoplay features and shared events.\nPlease refer to the option page for more details .\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nAs Syncs just shares events between browser windows, it is widely compatible with all slide show frameworks supporting basic navigation events. Keyboard Arrow right/left (as used by presenter devices) should be available in all frameworks.\n\nSyncs has been tested with the most popular slide show tools, such as:\n\n* Reveal.js\n* Prezi\n* Slides.com\n* Webslides\n* JessyInk\n* Impress.js\n* Deck.js\n* Bespoke.js"
