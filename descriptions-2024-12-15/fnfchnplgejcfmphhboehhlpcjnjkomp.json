Store link in the popup!\nâœ… List updates\n\nðŸ’›\n\nðŸ’¬ Say hi on PorNo!'s subreddit, r/ourlastpornblocker\n\nðŸ’¾  Porn URL-detection algorithm:\nhttps://github.com/mrvivacious/PorNo-_Porn_Blocker\n\nðŸ¤³ Android app:\nhttps://github.com/mrvivacious/PorNo_Android\n\nâ€“â€“â€“ IMPORTANT â€“â€“â€“\n* THIS APP IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT\nThe porn-site detection algorithm is still being improved. Therefore, not all porn/adult sites will be blocked, yet. More sites and improvements to the algorithm are added with every update, but keep this in mind if you are considering on using this tool for other purposes (a porn blocker on a child's computer, for example).\n* This app uses Google Analytics. The data is anonymized.\n* WE NEED MORE WEBSITES IN ITS DATABASE\nThe websites currently saved in the algorithm are the ones found in the USA, where I live and develop. Instructions for contributing ARE AT THE BOTTOM...assistance on globalizing the algorithm for more languages and countries will be greatly appreciated!\n* PorNo! IS A TOOL, NOT A CURE\nFor one to truly overcome porn addiction and use, it depends heavily on the person's own commitment, determination, and perseverance. There will be failure and hard times, but with enough effort, success is possible. All the best.\nâ€“â€“â€“ IMPORTANT â€“â€“â€“\n\n**** FEATURES ****\nâˆš ANONYMOUS(!) user mode\nâˆš Out of the box porn blocker\nâˆš Redirect users from porn sites to wholesome sites -- the PorNo! algorithm\nâˆš Custom ban-lists\nâˆš Support for NSFW Subreddits\nâˆš Streak to track your progress!\nâˆš Add local files as redirect links!\nX Cloud sync -- your saved links go everywhere you do (currently unavailable)\nâˆš Live updates to the algorithm\nâˆš \"Emergency\" button \nâˆš Resources for extra help and support inside the app\nâˆš How-to instructions available inside the app\nâˆš Privacy policy\n******************\n\nWelcome to PorNo!, an attempt at creating the last porn blocker anyone will ever need (we still have much to do, though ~).\nPorNo! is, by default, a porn-blocker, but with a twist: Instead of being greeted by a standard \"Site Blocked\" page, user will be redirected to sites that inspire and empower the user when s/he visits a porn site.\nInside a porn user's mind are many connections and pathways that have associated pleasure with porn. By redirecting users, we make an attempt to reroute these connections to associate pleasure with more wholesome and joyful content, overwriting the influences porn has left behind. \nThe idea is to convert unwanted sexual/pornographic dependencies into personal, meaningful energies, energy now used in wholesome and forward-moving outlets.\n\nClick the yellow heart in your browser for more information. \nAdd links to sites that inspire you, empower you, encourage you to do great things, to do your best....etc. Sites, articles, videos, music, add whatever! Included inside the popup are resources for support, instructions to use the app fully. To access the instructions, simply click on \"How to use PorNo!\" at the bottom of the popup. Instructions for anonymous use are also included on the how-to page.\n\nPlease email me (jvnnvt@gmail.com) all the porn sites you know exist as well as any sites that aren't being blocked. I've included a The source code for the algorithm is here: https://github.com/mrvivacious/porNo_open_source.\n\nGood luck in your efforts! \n\nâ€“â€“â€“\n\nView additional projects at mrvivacio.us.\nDonate at paypal.me/mrvivacious"
