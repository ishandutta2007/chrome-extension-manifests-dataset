To the Nazi masses, the only \"fair and balanced\" reporting came from media organizations allied with, or owned by, the party.\n\nFlash forward to America in the present day, and we have Donald Trump doing the same thing (albeit in his allegedly native English) whenever his own dishonety, incomptence, or duplicity is exposed. The media, to Trump and his allies, are either sycophantic, or 'dishonest'. \n\nThis extension helps to remind us of the historical context of Trump's words when he uses the phrase 'dishonest media'.\n\nIf you like the extension, feel free to throw me some cash via Patreon at the \"Website\" link below! \n\nOr, go to:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=4787989"
