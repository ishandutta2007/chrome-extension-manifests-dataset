Over. And. Over. And. Over. Again.\n\nThe conversation above has been repeated by GAFE teachers everywhere, and has led to the ever popular trick of changing the URL to ‘Force A Copy.’ Let’s be honest, modifying a URL is a ‘pro-tip,’ and is not a reasonable expectation of many teachers. This is the every teacher’s solution to this problem. Once sharing settings have been turned on, with the click of a button, the teacher instantly has a new URL to share with students on Classroom, E-Mail, Tone,  or whatever other means of communication the teacher prefers. \n\nConnect with Curt @Curt_Truc \n\nA special thanks goes out to @CYoungEdTech and @EdTech Heroes.\n\nSuggestions and bug reports are always appreciated."
