It is also open source!\n\nIf you use tab grouping or couldn't use it due to lack of options, Tabius is a must have extension for you.\n\nThe extension is packed with useful features like:\n\n✔️ Automatically create new tab groups when you open a link in a new tab.\n✔️ Auto Collapse inactive tab groups.\n✔️ Limit the browser to only create groups if the new tab matches the original tab's domain.\n✔️ Create custom tab grouping rules: always create tab groups with a specific name and color from your favorite websites!\n✔️ Save your favorite tab groups and restore them for later use!\n✔️ Don't want to create tab groups from a specific site? Create a blacklist from the settings or add the site to the blacklist right from the toolbar!\n✔️ Option to close an existing tab group when there is only 1 tab left in it.\n✔️ Limit maximum number of tabs allowed in a group.\n✔️ Automatically name tab groups based on domain/subdomain or the full URL.\n✔️ View current tab groups and act upon them by clicking on the extension icon right from the toolbar.\n✔️ Sync all your settings, tab groups, and custom lists with browser.\n✔️ ..and many more features.\n\nI created this extension from my need. I use tab groups all the time and the extension helps enhance this feature.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to email me: dev@faisalbin.com.\n\nThis extension is made with ❤️ in Munich.\n\nWhat's new in v2.0.5\n- Fixed width of popup when no tab groups are present\n- Other fixes.\n\nWhat's new in v2.0.1\n- You can now use the opener tab's title as the group name.\nTo do so, select \"Group Opener's title\" from Settings>Group Naming Convention\n\nWhat's new in version 2.0\n- Tabius has gone through a major redesign.\n- The extension has been rebuilt from the ground up.\n- You can now save your favorite tab groups for later.\n- Amend saved tab groups.\n- The popup is now more useful.\n- \"nameless\" group naming option.\n- Fixes scrolling issue if custom rules get too long.\n- Lots of bug fixes."
