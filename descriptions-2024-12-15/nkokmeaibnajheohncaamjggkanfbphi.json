These images are small, but their format is not widely recognized yet. By converting the image to PNG, you will be able to use it in image editing programs, and/or upload it to online image hosting sites such as imgur.\n\nThe extension has a low footprint: It does not use any memory or CPU unless you use it by clicking on the context menu option.\n\nOriginal release date: 3 Augustus 2013.\n\nUpdate (4 January 2014): If you use Chrome 30 or lower, then you cannot save the image from some web sites (such as the Chrome Web Store). Update to Chrome 31 for an optimal user experience.\n\nNotice (30 June 2014): Chrome 35 on KDE (Linux) has a bug that causes Chrome to crash whenever the Save As dialog is opened by an extension. Downgrade to Chrome 34 or upgrade to Chrome 36 to solve the problem.\n\nUpdate (2 June 2024): Manifest Version 3 and improved cookie / network partitioning and cache reuse."
