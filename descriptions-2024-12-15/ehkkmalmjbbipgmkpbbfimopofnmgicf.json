This is a useful tool becuase there are times when desiging a website that you want to replicate the design or functionality that a different site has, which may not be possible if the referenced site isn't a WordPress site. WordPress Detector makes it easy to determine if the site your looking at is built on the WordPress platform and provides insight into the tools they used to create it."
