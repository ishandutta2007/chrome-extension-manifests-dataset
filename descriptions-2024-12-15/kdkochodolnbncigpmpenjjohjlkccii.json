WebWall is the only all-in-one internet security and privacy extension you need. \n\n✓ Permissions \nWebWall uses the minimal amount of permissions necessary to enforce security and anti-tracking.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- WebWall never sends any of your activity or data to our servers or any other servers. We fully respect your privacy and security. Everything WebWall does to protect you runs locally on your computer and never requires interaction with 3rd party servers unlike every other internet security & privacy extension.\n\n- WebWall shows you exactly how websites are using your data, attempting to track your internet activity, and what actions WebWall took to block undesired tracking & suspicious internet activity.\n\n- Alerts you of potential phishing websites and other convincing security threats.\n\n- Blocks privacy trackers & tracking cookies\n\n- Blocks fingerprinters by obfuscating the data they use to track you.\n\n- Disables screen recorders & blocks analytics software on websites from recording your internet activity.\n\n- Sends the \"Do Not Track\" signal to tell companies / websites to not track you and seamlessly blocks network requests that disobey your desire to not be tracked.\n\n- Automatically enforces best practices for internet email security & privacy across most popular email services (Gmail, Yahoo, etc)\n\n- Increases web page load times by up to 20% by blocking unnecessary analytics and tracking scripts that don't need to be loaded.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n★ Reviews - Users (we are proud of)\n\nTom Aetler - ★★★★★\n\"WebWall saved me from a very convincing phishing email supposedly from \"PayPal\". I am extremely grateful.\n\nJessica Swarton - ★★★★★\n\"Does everything it claims and shows exactly what it's doing too. It's crazy what websites were doing with my data.\"\n\nDaniel Kramer - ★★★★★\n\"I have had WebWall for a week and so far it is working exactly as promised. Everything loads fast and my information is not going to places that I do not want it to go. I have not been blocked from any sites but a few of them have asked me to turn off my ad blocker. So far I very much like this extension and I have stopped getting ads that I do not want and my internet security feels enforced.\"\n\nPeter Mitchell - ★★★★★\n\"WebWall is fantastic it blocks everything and lets you know, I never realised how much of your information is grabbed by every site you visit. Thanks Webb wall\""
