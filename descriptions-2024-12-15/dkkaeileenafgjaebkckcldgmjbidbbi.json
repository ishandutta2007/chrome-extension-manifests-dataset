The extension will allow you to generate a bearer token. Once completed, the extension will inject the client id you provided, and the generated access token in requests made to api.twitch.tv/helix, allowing you to browse the API in your browser (as you would prior to the requirement of these fields).\n\nChanges: \n\nv1.4:\n- Bug fix related to automatic refreshing access token.\n\nv1.3:\n- Support for automatically refreshing access token at the determined expiration date/time\n\nv1.2:\n- Support for Chrome's Manifest v3. This means removing webRequest and webRequestBlocking in exchange for declarativeNetRequest permission.\n- Adds support for using one time \"code\" values, which are exchanged for bearer and refresh tokens.\n\nAs always, you can see the changes at the repo here: https://github.com/swiftyspiffy/Twitch-API-Injector"
