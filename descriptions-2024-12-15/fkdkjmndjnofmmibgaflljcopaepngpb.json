This tool will randomly generate valid meter numbers for both electricity (known as an MPAN) and gas (known as an MPRN). Both types of meter numbers must be generated to a specified format in order to be valid. Generated numbers can then be copied to the clipboard and pasted into a form field in web applications which accepts either a MPAN or MPRN.\n\nBoth MPxN's (shorthand for either MPAN or MPRN) have to be of a specified length and have a checksum calculated at the end of the number to verify the rest of the digits in the number are valid. The first couple of digits must also be in a particular range (e.g. MPAN's can only have the first two digits in the range of 10-36).\n\nThis MPxN tool will therefore save web developers and QA testers time in generating valid numbers when they are testing their applications."
