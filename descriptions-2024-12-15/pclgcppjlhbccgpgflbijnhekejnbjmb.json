Strange formatting, popup ads, and long introductions can get in the way of finding actual ingredients and instructions. \n\nMealClip wades through the nonsense for you, and provides a simple, consistent list of ingredients and instructions for easy viewing, downloading, and printing. Click the MealClip icon and a recipe will appear at the top of your screen.\n\nBasic use:\nMealclip will automatically load a small button in the top right corner of any page that appears to contain a recipe. Clicking on this button will open your formatted recipe. This feature can be turned off in the extension options. Recipes can also be loaded by clicking on the extension next to your search bar.\n\nDownloading and Printing:\nTo download a recipe, click the button labeled \"save\". To Print, click \"print\" and you will be able to print directly from the page. Make sure the recipe is formatted the way you want it before saving or printing.\n\nEditing:\nMealClip isn't perfect. If a recipe is not loaded correctly, you can click and edit any part of it manually before downloading."
