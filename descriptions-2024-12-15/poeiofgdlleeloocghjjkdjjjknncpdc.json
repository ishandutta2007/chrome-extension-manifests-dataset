Why would one want to do this? If you wanted to know how many images exist on a page. If you wanted to know what domains the page is using or pulling from. If the page is obfuscating a file or media you want direct access to. This would help with all of that.\n\nversion 1.2\n- Fixed variable setting for XHR pattern\nversion 1.1\n- Fixed how default values were set in storage but not shown in popup menu.\n- Updated how events are handled so that even in pages with chrome:// url's (extensions page, for example), the popup menu should still function.\n- Updated so any input in popup menu fields should highlight the save button to make it known to the users that manual changes requires a save to persist."
