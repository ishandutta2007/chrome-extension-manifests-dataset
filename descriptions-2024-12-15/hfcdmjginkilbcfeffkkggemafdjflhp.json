You can organize, categorize, and name them, then restore individual tabs or tab groups at any time. You can even sync them across devices!\n\nTab++ is inspired by similar extensions like OneTab, only with **WAY** more features... Like folders, cloud-syncing, easy backup and restore, and more!\n\n# Note: Usage help can be found in the options page. #\n\nNEW IN v1.7.1\n- Code minified to save space\n- Fixed version name glitch\n- Adjusted drag delay\n- Dragging a tablist triggers a view redraw as it should\n\nNEW IN v1.7.0:\n- Ported to the new manifest v3 API.\n- Total codebase rewrite with asynchronous architecture and service workers, for massively improved performance and stability.\n- Fixed graphical bugs on loading screen in newer Chrome(/Chromium) versions.\n- More error messages (instead of failing silently, without telling you!)\n- Automatic restore-from-backup on critical sync error. Say no more to the sync tab eating your tabs into the void because your internet is slow.\n- INFINITE SCROLLING! (Yeah boiii, now you can legit have 10,000+ tabs with zero lag! Tabs load via pop-in, as you scroll, similar to Discord and other messengers.)"
