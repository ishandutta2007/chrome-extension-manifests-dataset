If you're sick of people retweeting Trump into your timeline then you can just mute him, but this way you'll get periodic notices of nice things to make Twitter a more cheerful place.\n\nThis extension is designed to only affect Trump tweets in a timeline. If you click on a tweet's permalink you can see the original. This way you can check out a real Trump tweet if you need to without turning the extension on and off.\n\nMade by @GeneticJen."
