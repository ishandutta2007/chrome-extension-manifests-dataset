You also have the advantage that you can synchronise livestreams and videos which have been blocked for embedded play. You also can use the features YouTube has to offer e.g. liking the current video, storing the current video in your private playlist and many more.\n\nFeatures\n-------------\n- Synchronising videos and livestreams directly on YouTube\n- Basic permission system\n- Queue functionality\n- Autoplay functionality\n- Reactions\n- Dark and light mode (depending on your YouTube setting)\n\nIf you think there is anything missing then just create a feature request.\n\nWhat changes after installation?\n-------------\nAfter you installed the plugin you will see a few more buttons on YouTube when you watch a video. These buttons can be found directly next to the like/dislike buttons below a video. With these buttons you can create a sync room, leave a sync room, or add a video to the queue.\n\nUsage\n-------------\nSimply create a sync room directly on YouTube, copy the URL and give it to your friends. Now you can watch the videos together.\n\nFor a detailed summary on how to use this plugin please visit the GitHub Repository."
