Currently in production. This browser extension allows you to use ChatGPT directly, using your ChatGPT authorization token as authentication. The extension provides a small icon in the upper right corner, that when clicked, reveals a modal to input information into ChatGPT. You can choose to either input highlighted text on a webpage, or have ChatGPT's output processed as input. The extension provides an easier user interface for ChatGPT, and can be used across any webpage. This allows for a much more efficient and productive workflow. A gmail addition to the extension was also implemented, which implements a secondary ChatGPT icon when a composing an email on Gmail. This portion of the extension will send any information in the message body of the email to ChatGPT,  allowing the user to draft, rewrite, and respond to emails. This ChatGPT extension cannot access past emails or webpage information, and will only send user selected text to ChatGPT\n\n-Gmail capability added 2/23/2023\n-All webpage access added 2/26/2023"
