If this small text is enlarged, the page and website becomes easily readable (especially for far-sight condition of eyes).\nThis extension enlarges text, makes text colors a contrasting black / white color and a few subroutines.\nFont size within threshold is enlarged inversely with font size. That means small text made bigger than large text.\nText contrast can be increased by the 'Strength' slider, with high positive values making text more black / white and negative values keeping text color unchanged.\nThe strength slider also determines the Zoom %, with default zero strength giving 175% (1.75) zoom value.\nAll text within size of Threshold setting is increased in size with text closer to Font Threshold size increasing less than text much lower size than Threshold, depending of Font Increase % setting."
