The Saba Meeting Chrome Connector combined with the Saba Meeting App provides everything needed to attend virtual meetings and classes. The Saba Meeting Chrome Connector does not access or collect any personal data from users.\n\nNote that the Saba Meeting Chrome Connector alone is not enough to attend a Saba Meeting online session. It is merely an extension of the Saba Meeting App which is only available to Saba customers. The Saba Meeting Chrome Connector interacts with the Saba Meeting App to read its version number and to launch a user into a Saba Meeting online session.\n\nWhen clicking \"Add to Chrome\", users will see a warning that the Saba Meeting Chrome Connector can:\n\n     -Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\n     -Communicate with cooperating native applications\n\nRegarding \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\":\n\nThis is required since the URL format of Saba Meeting sites are varied â€“ the Saba Meeting Chrome Connector must request access to all websites visited by the browser. The Saba Meeting Chrome Connector looks for a key identifier in the web page that identifies it as a Saba Meeting application and will only act on those pages.\n\nRegarding \"Communicate with cooperating native applications\":\nThis is required for the Saba Meeting Chrome Connector to communicate with the Saba Meeting App (a native Windows/Mac application) on the user's client. The Saba Meeting Chrome Connector does not communicate with any other native applications."
