Calm for Chrome will invite you to take a deep breath before letting you check a website on your “blacklist.” It doesn’t block you from doing anything but instead just makes you more mindful of what you are doing.  If you realize, after taking a deep breath, that you were mindlessly checking a site, you can, at that point, simply close the page, or alternatively, take a healthier break offered via www.calm.com.\n\nWe believe this extension will work better than a website blocker or an extension that completely blocks websites, because those types of extensions eventually becomes so annoying that we uninstall them.  \n\nIf the breath bubble is occurring too frequently for you, we offer a number of ways to adjust this extension.  You can add and remove sites from your blacklist.  You can also make the bubble occur a smaller percent of the time (e.g., if you only want an occasional mindfulness reminder), and you can set a minimum amount of time that must pass before a breath bubble is allowed to occur again (e.g., if once you start taking a break you want at least 15 minutes of time without a mindfulness reminder). \n\nWelcome to a calmer chrome!"
