And it's not even compatible with the category filtering.\n\nCurrent features:\n- projects loaded with the page (as opposed to through the god-awful AJAX script) are upgraded with a status bar that is fetched from the widget card.\n\nCurrently in development:\n- work around the AJAX script so that all projects get this improvement and not just the first page.\n\nVersion history:\n\n0.10: Bugfix (Kickstarter switched project links to HTTPS, but it doesn't seem to agree with the jQuery GET, so switched back to HTTP to get widget info)\n0.9: Complete overhaul to start coping with the new page.\n0.8: Fixes to now defunct Firefox extension.\n0.7: Fix to adapt to the new Kickstarter layout\n0.6: Performance optimization (and some code cleaning)\n0.5.3: Bugfix (goals funded at over 999% are now correctly evaluated)\n0.5.2: Added anti-chronological order\n0.5.1: Small fix (padding)\n0.5: Sorting by chronological order\n0.4: Sorting by alphabetical order\n0.3.1: Changed the behavior of tab buttons and added Show/Hide links.\n0.3: Filtering by status.\n0.2.1: Time and CPU load optimization.\n0.2: Merge of multiple pages.\n0.1.1: Added icons.\n0.1: Initial version of the project with only color by status."
