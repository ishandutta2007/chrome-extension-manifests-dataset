The solution? -- LIO. LIO is a lightweight batch image optimizer.\n\nI want to help others be able to spend more time editing, and less time preparing pictures for the web. Right now LIO can only compress pictures, but in future releases it will be able downsize, sharpen, and apply minor adjustments to pictures."
