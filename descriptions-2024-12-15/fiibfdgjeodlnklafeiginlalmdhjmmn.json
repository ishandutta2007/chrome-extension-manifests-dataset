StudyIQ's chrome extension provides a smart way to use time-stamped summary of all the topics (chapters) discussed inside a video. You can use topic summary to jump to any part of the video. You can also search for topics using a keyword OR revisit the video using previous/next topics.\n\nAbout StudyIQ\n\nStudy IQ is one of India's leading Test Prep companies especially in Tier II & III markets.
