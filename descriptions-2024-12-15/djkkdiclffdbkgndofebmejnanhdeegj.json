Why? We want to copy it quite often! Usually to add the sender to a CRM, or search for the sender in our inbox. It made sense for us to finally add a copy button where we need it the most, next to the sender's email address. With this extension... we also want YOU to save 2 seconds!\n\n💻 How to use the extension:\n🔸Add the extension\n🔸Open a conversation/email in Gmail\n🔸Click your new copy button\n🔸Voilá! The sender's email address way now copied.\n\n❓ Frequently asked questions:\n\n📌 What does this extension do?\n- It copies the sender's email address.\n\n📌 Do you save any data?\n- No\n\n📌 How does it work?\n- When you open a conversation/email in Gmail, the extension will look for the sender's email address. Two pixels to the right, it will add a nice and clean copy button. If you would click this button (we recommend you do), you will copy the sender's email address!\n\n📪 Contact us:\nDo you have any suggestions of how we can improve the plugin? Let us know!\n\nGmail mockup created with https://www.figma.com/community/file/1023006155932070158/free-gmail-gui-inbox-2021"
