Before, whenever you saw either the name or address of a certain place, you had to do all these steps: highlight the address, copy the address, open a new tab, go to google maps, paste the address, click search. With Easy Address Search, all you have to do is right click the location and we will show you the map. Something new about this extension is that we don't navigate you away from your current tab when we show you the map! Instead, you see the map as a smaller popup; after you are finished looking at the map, you can hide the popup and get back to whatever you were just doing. \n\nHighlight, right click, search!"
