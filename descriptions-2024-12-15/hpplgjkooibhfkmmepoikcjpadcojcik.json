Every time you open a new tab, you are teleported to a procedural planet in space with random terrains, oceans, atmosphere, and biomes. The random planets, stars, gas giants, and asteroids provide you an infinite number of 3D space themed wallpaper for your new tab. Since every planet is rendered in 3D, the space wallpapers are interactive! You are able to move the camera freely to explore the planets in space. Each planet in space comes with its own unique name and stats such as temperature and habitability. \n\nCurrently, there are three types of celestial space object in the Tabiverse: planets, stars, gas giants, and asteroids. Each space object might have a ring or moons. We are adding more space objects such as black holes and space anomalies very soon. You are also able to save and share your planet coordinates with your friends so that they can explore the same planets. More features such as an account system and multiplayer are also in the works.\n\nFollow us on Twitter and join us on Discord to share feedback and get the latest news:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tabiverse\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/MUgRGwE\n\nChangelog\nVersion 0.0.0.16 - Feb 27th, 2020\n- Made the gas giant's planet ring align with its planet's axis\n- Made planet orbit camera's animation base on time instead of fps\n- Animations no longer skip frames when tab is in the background\n\nVersion 0.0.0.15 - Feb 23rd, 2020\n- Added a brand new type of celestial object: gas giants!\n- Added multiverse system to preserve planets in the past versions\n- Removed FPS setting.
