Typically, your eyes jump around the page, a process known as saccadic movement, which can slow down the overall reading process. By reducing these movements, you can focus more directly on the content, leading to quicker comprehension and less cognitive strain.\nVersion 1.4 UPDATE:\n*Updated Slider UI\n*Track your progress!\nVersion 1.3 UPDATE: \nPAGE PACER PRO!!!
