Please note, this extension functions exclusively when the https://plan.tomtom.com tab is active.\n\nConversion Options:\n\n• Manually convert and download as OV2, then import into \"TomTom Plan/My Items/Places/POI Files/Import OV2 File.\"\n\n• Alternatively, utilize the Convert & Upload to POI files feature for direct conversion. A new POI File with the name \"_favorite-(current date, e.g., 21032024).ov2\" will be uploaded.\n\nNotification and Activation:\n\nYour TomTom device will notify you once your places have been updated. Subsequently, activate the new POI list through either of the following paths:\n\n• Settings > Appearance > Show PDI list on map\n• Settings > Map & Display > Show on map > Points of Interest\n\nVerification:\n\nZoom in on one of your favorite locations on your TomTom device and verify the presence of a double pin. This indicates successful conversion and upload of the POI. Once confirmed, you can safely delete favorites manually.\n\nFAQ:\nQ: Inconsistencies between TomTom Plan and TomTom Device Favorite Locations\nA: Discrepancies may occur when plan.tomtom.com adjusts the point's latitude and longitude to the nearest street address if saved without an address on the device.\n\nQ: Security Concerns\nA: This extension utilizes public API data provided by TomTom. All requests are handled client-side, ensuring no data leaks can occur. It is advisable to create a backup of your POI/GPX data before usage.\n\nQ: Supported Languages\nA: English, French, German, Italian, Romanian, Spanish.\n\n⚠️ NOTICE\nThis Chrome extension is not authorized, endorsed, or created by TomTom International BV.
