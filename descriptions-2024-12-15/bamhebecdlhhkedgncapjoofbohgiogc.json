Not only do I read the initial response, but I also check the listed sources. Very often, I want to save the question and answer to study more later without having to leave dozens of tabs open or repeat the same search more than once.\n\nSo, I've created this simple extension that grabs the answer and question from FastGPT and creates a nice markdown, copying it to your clipboard. I know FastGPT's answer is already in markdown format, but the extension gives me a more convenient way to copy and paste."
