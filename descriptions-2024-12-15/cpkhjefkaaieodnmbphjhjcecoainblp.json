Here’s DogeCam to the rescue!\n\n• Tons of cool Video filters and the possibility to combine them together.\n• Want to be on the video but not have people see you? Just Blur yourself.\n• Maybe try the spooky “invert” filter.\n• Or better yet, show up as a pixelated version of yourself!\n• Perhaps even record a video of yourself and have that loop instead \n  of being \"live\"!\n\nMake your video calls Doge-y today!\n\nThe User can easily configure their Filter (Or Filter combination) by:\n |1| Clicking the extension’s icon. \n |2| Saving the desired settings.\nThe settings can also be changed on the fly mid-call!\n\n\nSupported/Tested Apps:  \nMeets || Hangouts || Zoom || Slack || Teams\nShould _ideally_ work with any page that requests Video.\n\nNotes: \nTeams currently does not support the Pixel/Blur background mode.\nThe Pixel/Blur background mode is quite compute-intensive and as a result, may impact performance. \nIf any mode/filters fail to work as intended try disabling video and waiting 5 seconds before re-enabling the video."
