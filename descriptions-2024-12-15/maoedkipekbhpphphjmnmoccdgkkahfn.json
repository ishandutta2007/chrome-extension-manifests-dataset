The figures vary worldwide, but in the USA it might be even 80% according to NBC. However, not all medical information sources can be trusted.\n\nWebsites for Health Assessment Tool plug-in is here to help you!\n\nThis extension allows to assess the credibility of medical information online. It gives the websites scores from 0 to 10 based on averaged responses of medical experts and other Internet users.\n\nThe project was created by Health-IT enthusiasts during NHS Hack 2020 in Cardiff and is fully open source."
