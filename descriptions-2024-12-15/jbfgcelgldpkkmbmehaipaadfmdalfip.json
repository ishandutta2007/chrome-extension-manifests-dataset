Don’t be a robot: humanize your digital interactions with Daphne. Go to the TUTORIAL section below to get started.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nEngage with your customers/followers online in a rapid, scalable, and human way across all supported digital platforms (social media, chat apps, email clients, CRM software). Quickly personalize and send pre-saved snippets using keyboard hotkeys and engage in hundreds of parallel conversations in a matter of minutes. All your snippets and hotkeys are saved on your local machine for enhanced security and performance. You can use your snippets even when you are offline. Daphne is based in Switzerland and compliant with strict Swiss privacy laws. No personal information is required to create your account and we don’t even ask for your login information to connect to your social platforms. Your privacy comes first.\n\nAt its core, Daphne is a human augmentation software with a focus on enabling real humans (not bots) to rapidly send messages and have authentic text-based conversations with other humans online. Daphne is NOT a chatbot, and does not use AI at the moment. If you already use a chatbot or conversational AI tool, Daphne can be used to complement your work and provide a human touch to your online conversations. Daphne also works well with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Social Media Management (SMM) software and has been used extensively for science communication, customer support, conversational marketing, and conversational recruitment activities on popular social media platforms.\n\n \nTUTORIAL\n\nFollow the steps below ( OR visit https://daphne.tech/tutorial.html )\n\nInstall\n\n1. Install Extension available on Google Chrome Store\n\nSupport: Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Brave, Opera, Microsoft Edge, etc.).\n\nKnown Issues: Be sure of clicking on Extension Icon while being in a supported website ( e.g. Playground ) after reloading your current tab.\n\n2. Open Sidebar clicking on Extension Icon.\n\nKnown Issues: In case you can't find Extension Icon, click on the puzzle-piece-like button (on the top right corner of your browser to display all extension icons).\n\nRecommendation: To easy access, Pin Icon to be always shown on your toolbar, clicking on its corresponding Pin-like button.\n\n3. Create an account clicking on the link below Sign In button\n\n4. Agree to terms and conditions to use the extension.\n\nRecommendation: To remember your credentials locally, click on Remember Me\n\n\nUsage\n1. Visit a supported website to begin with ( e.g. Playground )\n\nKnown Issues : Extension works based on URL Site and Path Site, which may include multiple context sites per path site. To access the list of supported contexts, check the bottom part of side panel where contexts are shown as platform icons.\n\n2. Define a hotkey with any capital letter, number, or symbol ( i.e. \"H\") and hit the \"+\" symbol ( blue button at the side panel ). This will create a textbox associated to the chosen key.\n\n3. Write a message within the textbox ( i.e. \"Hello World\" ) which will be saved automatically at any keystroke.\n\nExtra: Change your message in the textbox to modify the associated snippet. Delete occurs on clicking delete icon wich will free hotkey for new usage.\n\n4. Enable Extension pressing on your BLOQ MAYUS ( or CAPS LOCK ) key at the left side of your keyboard.\n\nExpected Behavior: Message input at the selected platform will be rounded by a YELLOW BOX on activation. When extension is enabled, PRESS your chosen KEY ( as defined when creating your snippet ) to send the associated message.\n\nOptional: SWITCH ON / OFF the auto-send button according to your preferences. It will switch from gray to purple on auto-send activation.\n\n\nScenario: Call-To-Action\n1. Define a \"Hello\" message as greetings to open a conversation ( i.e. What's up? How are your these days? )\n\n2. Define an \"Anchor\" message as general reply according to the most likely answer expected, anchored to a call-to-action (i.e. Awesome! May I ask you a quick favor? )\n\n3. Define a \"Conversion\" message as a call-to-action waiting for approval first ( i.e. Could you please share my most recent post? )\n\n4. Define an \"Key\" message which includes a link to a webpage according to the call-to-action requested. Don't forget say thank you (i.e. I owe you one! You know what to do then... this is the link [link] )\n\n! Recommendation: Use mnemonics to help you remembering what key is associated to what messages. In the example above, keys have been carefully chosen. Even further, we could refer to this simple structure as a \"H-A-C-K\" structure but you could have used \"1-2-3-4\" (or whatever random keys you prefer to use)\n\n5. Choose some contacts on any supported platform where you have, well, contacts and send \"H\" and wait for a response, then \"A\" if they reply to previous message, then \"C\", and so on.\n\n! Expected Behavior: Most likely, not all your contacts will reply to all of your messages. This is an opportunity to recall the concept of marketing funnel for which you can estimate (or precisely compute ) the conversion ratio of a given sequence ( i.e. H/A , A/C , C/K ) meaning how many replies you get per messages sent in an defined interval of time. A low conversion in a particular step, is an opportunity of asking whether a particular messages does not works as expected, so it can be changed to try again.\n\nFEATURES \n\nSNIPPETS – save your knowledge base and responses to frequently asked questions in a single accessible location in your browser and avoid repetitive typing forever.\n\nHOTKEYS – connect your snippets to single keys on the keyboard and rapidly personalize and send your snippets using keyboard hotkeys.\n\nAUTO-SEND – enable auto-send to engage with customers/followers even faster or disable auto-send to customize your messages before sending them.\n\nPRIVACY – Daphne is based in Switzerland and compliant with strict Swiss privacy laws.

Your privacy comes first.\n\nSECURITY – all of your snippets and hotkeys are saved on your local machine for enhanced security and performance.
