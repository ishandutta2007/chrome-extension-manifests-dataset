Well, now is your chance to take the party to any website of your choice! Expanding your professional network on LinkedIn can be a chore sometimes, but you will only have a better experience if you further bloat their UI with Katy Perry's Left Shark or an overweight Spiderman getting down to Hotline Bling. Just install the GIF Dance Party Chrome Extension, and click on the disco ball to the right of Chrome's address bar to get the party started!\n\nDISCLAIMER: This extension does not work on the chrome web store, chrome extension settings page, nor a blank new tab page but it should work on any other site. If you then click the disco ball and nothing happens, just try refreshing the page and clicking it again. Should work like a charm afterwards.\n\n* Customize your party *\nAlthough this Chrome Extension already comes with an army of GIF dancers and a bumpin' set of audio loops, you probably have some awesome GIF dancers or songs in mind that we aren't aware of. You can toss those dancers or songs into the bunch when this Chrome Extension is running to make your party even better. Just pop open the ADD DANCER or SELECT SONG menu and paste in the corresponding URL.\n\n\n* Share your party! *\nNo party is fun by yourself! We encourage you to record or take screenshots of your GIF Dance Party and send them to your friends! Heck -- you can even encourage them to install the extension as well. If you can't seem to share it enough, then send it over to GDPExtension@gmail.com since we'd love to see it too!\n\n\n* Make the party better *\nIf you have ideas on how to make the party better, feel free to send your feedback to GDPExtension@gmail.com. We also might be updating the Chrome Extension with more GIF dancers and music. If you think that you've found the perfect media for this Chrome Extension, then we might push it out!\n\n\nP.S. We're open source! (https://github.com/jlyneu/GIF-Dance-Party-Extension)\n\n\n* Update - 6/2/16\nYou can now add a custom song from YouTube by providing a normal YouTube url in the 'Add a custom song URL or YouTube link' input field when selecting a song. In order to comply with YouTube's terms of service, the video itself will be displayed next to the other menu buttons.\nYou can now also add a custom gif dancer by providing a normal Giphy url in the 'Add a custom GIF URL' input field when adding a dancer.\nAdded the song form http://www.breadfish.co.uk to the song list (BREADFISH).\nAdded several more gif dancers to the list.\n\n*Update - 12/31/15\nAdded a new SHAKE button at the bottom of the screen\n\n\nCreated by Jimmy Ly and Tyler Krupicka"
