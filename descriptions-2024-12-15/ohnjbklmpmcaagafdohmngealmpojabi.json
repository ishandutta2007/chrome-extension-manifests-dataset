This chrome extension shows a list of languages and with a click it will take you to the same content in another language.\n\nKhan Academy is a non-profit educational organization that provides free videos, articles and exercises in over 36 languages.\n\nThe list of languages is customizable.  Hitting the \"Language Options\" button will bring up a list of languages to pick from.  Select the languages you want to see in the extension, and deselect languages you don't want to see.\n\nYou may have to log in once for each language you're using.\n\nIf content is unavailable in the selected language you'll get a \"page not found\" error.  Hitting \"back\" will take you back to the content in the previous language.  Certain pages like classroom and home pages are not available in some languages.\n\nThis project was created during a Khan Academy hackathon and is provided as-is with no support, but we hope you find it useful.\n\nThis code is open source and available at https://github.com/Khan/language-toggle.  See the README there for more information."
