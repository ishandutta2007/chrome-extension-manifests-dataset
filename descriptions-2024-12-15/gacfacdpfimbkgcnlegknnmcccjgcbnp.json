Oh, and you can practice writing with it too.\n\nCan be used by native Chinese speakers to learn English as well.\n\nInstantly makes any web pages in Chinese as your learning resources.\n\nSuddenly remembers a Chinese word (or needing to quickly know the Chinese word(s) of an English word(or phrase)) that is not in the page? CWS has a searchable dictionary (üîç icon in CWS toolbar pop-up) that you can use in this situation. You can also use your device's microphone to search the word instead of typing it out.\n\nSet your own learning priorities by color-coding and/or annotating the words with Pinyin(or zhuyin/bopomofo), HSK, or Familiarity. You already know how to pronounce most words, and you need reinforcement on their tones? Just color-code or annotate the hanzi(Chinese character) with tone. You just want to learn the Chinese language without needing to learn hanzi? You can make CWS convert the hanzi to pinyin automatically. The learner decides what to learn based on his/her priorities, not the tool.\n\nWords separator for page and dictionary.\n\nDemystifies Chinese readability by words separation and pinyin(or zhuyin/bopomofo) annotation.\n\nDemystifies a Chinese character by separating it to its component characters, this can be done in the dictionary by right-clicking the character. Multi-characters word can be separated as well.\n\nMine sentences from imported Offline sentence miner.\n\nMine sentences from 10 or more online mining sites.\n\nLearners can add more sentence mining sites by themselves without needing to ask the developer to update the list of 10 online sentence mining sites.\n    \nHover less, read more using the extension's sentence mode dictionary, saves a lot of time.\n\nLook up the meanings of a Chinese word and phrase while browsing the web.\n\nLookup the Chinese word(s) of an English word and phrase while browsing the web.\n\nEasily change the hanzi's size and font of the page to make reading more relaxing.\n\nEnhances tones memorization by using pin1yin1 IME.\n\nQuite configurable, and easy to use.\n\nCan be made to remember 3 websites visited for each word, this can be enabled in Recall and Rewrite modules.\n\nRead the complete functionalities of CWS in https://chinese-words-separator.github.io/\n\n**********\n\nHOW TO USE THE DICTIONARY:\nSimply go to a web page in Chinese. Then to use the dictionary, hover the mouse cursor over any Chinese words (i.e., Chinese characters or even Chinese words that are not using pure Chinese characters, e.g., 3Q, AAÂà∂) to pop up the sticky note-like dictionary that shows the English translation of the Chinese word(or phrase) along with its pinyin (or zhuyin/bopomofo) romanization; on phone or tablet, just tap the Chinese word or sentence(or phrase).\n\nHOW TO USE THE WORD OR CHARACTER SEPARATOR IN THE DICTIONARY:\nRight-click the word(or phrase) or character in the dictionary. On phone/tablet, swipe the word(or phrase) or character to the right.\n\nHOW TO USE THE WORDS SEPARATOR IN THE PAGE:\nChoose any of the following: Beginner, Lower-intermediate, Intermediate, Advanced, or configure it in More Settings (‚öô icon in CWS pop-up toolbar) screen.\n\nTo make the extension work on Android, install Kiwi browser on your Android device, then install CWS from chrome web store:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser\n\nTo use the extension on Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, install CWS from:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/app/chinese-words-separator/id1598790017\n\nFor Chinese-French, Chinese-German, Chinese-Hungarian definitions, follow these instructions:\nhttps://github.com/chinese-words-separator/chinese-words-separator.github.io/issues/27#issuecomment-2235239809\n\n**********\n\nLatest version (optimizations):\n\n* Optimized the words separator's processor, it is now using just a 160 KB memory lookup to perform a task.\nIn the past, it was reading the word's HSK level from a big file which causes the words separator memory consumption to spike up to 100 MB; now the words HSK level info is embedded directly into the code, which is just 160 KB in size\n\n* Optimized memory footprint for CWS's dictionary, it can now be just 26 MB.\nCWS's dictionary can now be made significantly more lightweight than other dictionaries despite CWS having over 180K words (others have 120K words). This can be made possible by making CWS read the dictionary from the database instead of from file. To configure CWS to read the dictionary from the database instead of from file, go to CWS's Options screen and click the button labeled *Save the dictionary to database*. With database use, the dictionary's memory footprint will be reduced from 108 MB down to 26 MB\n\n    Other file-based dictionaries' memory footprint:\n    * Zhongwen: 42 MB\n    * LiuChan: 82 MB\n    * Inkah: 76 MB\n    * Zhongzhong: 45 MB\n\nVersions: https://chinese-words-separator.github.io/versions.html\n\n**********\n\nDictionary sources:\n* CC-CEDICT - Over 120K words\n* CedPane - Over 70K words, plenty of names and proper nouns\n\nIf you need to contribute word definitions, prefer contributing to CC-CEDICT:\nhttps://cc-cedict.org/editor/editor.php?handler=ListChanges\n\nIf you need to contribute names and proper nouns, prefer contributing to CedPane:\nhttps://github.com/ssb22/CedPane"
