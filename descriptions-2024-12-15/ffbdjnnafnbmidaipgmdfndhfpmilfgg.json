The extension offers a dual-tabbed interface that segregates functionalities into two main areas: Semantic Entities and Images, making it user-friendly and highly organized.\n\nKey Features:\nSemantic Entities Tab:\n\nEntity Extraction: Users can extract semantic entities from any web page. This feature is particularly useful for SEO and content optimization, allowing users to understand key subjects and terms associated with the content.\nAPI Key Integration: Incorporates TextRazor's powerful API to analyze web pages and extract entities. Users can enter their API key once, and it gets saved for future sessions, enhancing convenience.\nCopy to Clipboard: Extracted entities can be easily copied to the clipboard with a single click, facilitating easy data management and usage in other applications or reports.\nImages Tab:\n\nImage Extraction: Automatically gathers and lists all images from the current web page, including background images that are often missed by standard image download tools.\nDownload All Images: With a single click, users can download all images found on a page. Images are zipped and saved locally, which is ideal for designers and content managers.\nDownload All Images as JPEG: Converts and downloads all images in JPEG format, regardless of their original format. This is particularly useful for maintaining consistency in file types for project uploads or presentations."
