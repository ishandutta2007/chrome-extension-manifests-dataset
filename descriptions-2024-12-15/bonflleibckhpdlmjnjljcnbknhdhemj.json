Sometimes it does not count reliably because it does not use heavy libraries for bigrams and trigrams, in addition some of the text is sometimes loaded dynamically.  But for quick removal of positions and analysis on the fly is ideal. \nSend recommendations on how to improve the script to your friends on Twitter or Telegram.\nI write more complex versions of the script in Python using complex libraries for trigrams (2-3 words) without case sensitive, but they are complicated and need a separate server.\n\nAdditional information about me: I automate personal sites in igaming niche, write parsers and scripts to automate link building strategy."
