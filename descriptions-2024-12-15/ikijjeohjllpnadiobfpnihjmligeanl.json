You see others outgrow you every day while your posts sink into the abyss never to be seen by human eye. \n\nI know 'cause I'm there (sad face).\n\nBut Kieran's got certain frameworks that got him out of the abyss and blasted him into the sky farther than Musk's SpaceX rockets. The Triple Tap Writing Approach, The Success Story Framework,  The 90-Day Sprint, to name a few. Using them, he escaped his 9-5 and became an internet entrepreneur. \n\nHe lays out all those frameworks in his course, High Impact Writing.\n\nBut this extension hands you strategies from that course for FREE. \n\nYou get a writing or audience-building principle every time you open a new browser tab. In a minimalist, professionally designed page.\n\nHow come it's free? Did you pirate the guy's course?\n\nNo.\n\nI'm a happy customer who's got great value from High Impact Writing. \n\nI enjoyed it so much that I created this extension at my own cost, as a gift for Kieran. He's on board with unveiling some of his tips because he believes in giving free value (he does that a lot on X & LinkedIn). \n\nAnd we're both using this extension every day.\n\nNow...\n\nThese are valuable secrets at no cost, right in your browser.\n\nYou've got nothing to lose.\n\nHit \"Add to Chrome\". ✌\n\n***\n\nPS: This extension doesn't collect any data. \n\nPPS: You can find out more about:\n\n• High Impact Writing at highimpactwriting.co\n\n• Kieran at @ItsKieranDrew on X\n\n• Me at @iamEduardCosmin on X (DM me, I would love to hear any feedback from you, or just say 'banana' cause 'hello' is too boring)"
