When you hover on any link element, the underlying - href - will be displayed as the link's title. Moreover, a colored footer will also be displayed at the bottom of the page showing the link href.\n\nIf the underlying domain for the link is similar to the page's domain, this color will be BLUE. If the link is third-party the color is GREEN. For a situation where the displayed URL in the link's text content is different than the underlying href, the footer color will be RED. The toolbar icon color will also be updated according to the above rules. For any link, if you right-click and select - Scan link for threats, the add-on scans the link with the SafeBrowsing JavaScript API (https://safebrowsing.google.com/). When you first install the add-on, please visit the options page to activate the safe-browsing API. From the toolbar popup, you can also turn the add-on ON or OFF. Moreover, you can hide the page's footer if you find it inconvenient. Please note that you can still scan links for threats even if the page footer is hidden.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/link-revealer.html)."
