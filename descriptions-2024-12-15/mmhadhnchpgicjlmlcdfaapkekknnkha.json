It sanitizes the URL (stripping it of the '?' character, if existing, and everything that follows it) and then sends it to archive.today in a way which requests the most recent archived version of the URL.\n\nFor example, clicking the extension's button when at https://somesite.com/home?kj345d will automatically redirect Chrome to https://archive.is/newest/https://somesite.com/home.\n\nThis lets you effortlessy view the most recent archived version, and at the same time solves the problem of archive.today mistakenly thinking that your URL does not exist in their archive merely because it includes the '?' character (archive.today seems to treat each URL as unique even if the only differentiator is '?' and some subsequent characters).\n\nTo use this extension, browse to the desired web page and simply click on the extension's icon. It will automatically sanitize the current URL and transfer you to archive.is, where you can view the most recent archived version of the web page, or request that the page be archived if it has not been archived yet.\n\nThis extension is NOT affiliated with archive.today and is offered by me, just a fellow user of archive.today, as a tool to more easily utilize archive.today.\n\nThe extension's icon is courtesy of flaticon.com.
