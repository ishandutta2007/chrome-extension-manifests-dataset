Only about 1% of website homepages meet the ADA standard for accessibility. So it’s no wonder that the use of computers by people with disabilities is 50% less than those of people without disabilities.\n\nHere, at Reforge, we have leveraged a suite of tools to help make viewing and browsing the web easier for multiple types of disabilities. Our initial set of features are listed below!\n\nCurrent Features:\n- Focus Content: It will blur the content around the page, keeping important headers like navigation bars, in order to make the process of activities like reading a Wikipedia article more efficient.\n- Text Highlighting: This makes reading paragraphs and text alike a lot easier. It will highlight the text you are reading in order to make for a smoother reading experience.\n- Text-to-Speech: It will speak whatever text is being selected using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Lifelike Speech Synthesis. \n- Increase Text and Button Sizing: This helps increase the size of buttons, and users can select color to make buttons easier to read. \n- Keyboard Auto Scrolling: This lets you scroll through content easily without using your mouse! \n\nAll of these features have a use for different types of disabilities like ADHD, limited motor control, visual impairments, and more. \n\nTogether, this suite of tools allows for those with disabilities to access the web more easily and without relying on other people!"
