Many things don't look good, some may not function very efficiently. Don't worry about your data though since this extension only reads it and never write on it.\n\nSome features from this extension may make it into the tracker itself eventually (and would look a hundred times cooler for sure).\n\n1.5.4 changelog :\n- Fixed mastered terrors not initiating properly."
