It eliminates that annoying one step. However, Google Flights often fails in providing the best price. Many of times, it failed to find connecting flights which would make last minute trips cheaper. Similarly, it would find the exact same flight as other sites, but label them at a higher price, somewhere around 5% to 15%.\n\nTravel Helper looks to take advantage of the easiness of Google Flights and the ability of the more powerful sites such as Skyscanner and Kayak in order to provide users with the lowest price possible for their next destination.\n\nTo use the extension, all you simply need to do is search for your destination using google search. A small portion of google flight should be visible in the search results. Just click \"Show Flights\" to see your current flight. All that's left is to filter your number of passengers, dates, and cabin class, and finally select which sites you want to compare from our popup.\n\nThis extension does not save any user data. It simply gathers your inputted information on google flights by opening the popups for passenger, destination, and dates. This information opens your preferred sites for comparison.\n\nSafe travels everyone."
