This intuitive extension for the Audible web player introduces a much-needed feature: a dedicated volume slider. Designed to harmoniously blend with the player's existing layout, it appears as though it's always been a part of it.\n\nYou can also use it in Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/voluble/)\n\nWith Voluble, you gain precise control over the audio level directly within the player, eliminating the need to adjust your computer's system settings or resort to external applications. This innovation addresses a notable gap in the Audible player's functionality, which, until now, lacked a built-in volume adjustment, leading to experiences that were often too loud or too quiet.\n\nVoluble stands out as a simple yet effective solution, offering enhanced control over your audiobook listening. It's not only completely free but also open-source, ensuring your data and tokens are never shared with third parties or the developer. You're invited to explore and contribute to its development on Github: https://github.com/Vito0912/Voluble\n\nCurrently, Voluble supports all languages available on Audible. While other languages are compatible, they are automatically translated into English, which may sometimes result in minor text overflow.\n\nShould you encounter any issues, or if your language isn't supported, feel free to reach out via email for assistance."
