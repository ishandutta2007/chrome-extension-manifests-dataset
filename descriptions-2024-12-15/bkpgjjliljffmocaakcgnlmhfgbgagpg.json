Bearblog is your best bet - core HTML elements make a faster, easier web. Everyone should use it.\n\nA core focus of Markdown is wrapping text in characters like asterisks or underscores to style it with italics or underlines, respectively. Normally, if the text is already typed, you would have to arrow over to the beginning of the word, type your character, and then arrow over to the end of the word to type the final character. This is time consuming.\n\nThis extension allows users to select the text they want to wrap, press whatever key they want to wrap the selection with, and automatically wrap the word.\n\nSupported characters:\n\"markdown\" \n\n{markdown}\n\n*markdown*\n\n_markdown_\n \n$markdown$\n\n`markdown` \n\n~~markdown~~ \n\n==markdown== \n\n[markdown] \n\n(markdown)\n\nNote: $text$ is used for MathML and LaTeX compatibility, while backticks are used for code.\n\nThis extension also allows for image linking and link creation with [text], and automatically creates the complete Markdown format for links in the form: [link](). Your cursor will be inserted into the open parentheses to paste in a link. For images, select your alt text and press  ! to insert the markdown syntax for an image.\n\nFor more Markdown syntax, see this link https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/.\n\nThis extension was inspired by VSCode, which provides helpful text editing features for markdown editing and faster code completion.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nWe respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
