Or, maybe an editor of a publication hosted on Medium? In either case, you have probably more than once copy and pasted a signature or sign-off that hardly ever changes into your articles.\n\nWith Signature, the days of copy and pasting or manually typing out a signature and styling it again and again are over. Simply type your blog's signature once, style it as you see fit, and save it. Now, whenever you're ready to insert your signature, simply click on the Medium \"+\" button and select the nib icon - Signature automatically pastes your saved signature for you!\n\nFeatures include:\n\n - emoji support just like Medium (use a colon (\":\") followed by a few characters to bring up some options)\n - native styling (bold, italics, code, quote, etc.)\n - toolbar button and keyboard shortcut (\"Alt + Shift + S\") to open settings page"
