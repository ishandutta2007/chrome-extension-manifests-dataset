You can view the main chat, and the secondary chat window at the same time. For the secondary chat, you can filter who's messages appear in the chat. This allows you to create a specialized chat where you only get messages from your moderators, or special VIPs. Can be very helpful for extremely noisy Picarto chats with lots of people.\n\n-=INSTRUCTIONS=-\nYou can toggle the plugin on and off by clicking on the blue filter icon added in the upper right. Blue means off, green means on. Once the plugin is toggled on you can adjust the size of the new chat window by grabbing the invisible resize bar at the bottom of the window. You can also add people to the filtered chat by typing their names into the text area that appears in the toolbar. Separate the names by a space, a comma, or newlines. Feel free to mix and match separators.\n\nYou can add or remove people from the filter list, and their messages will be retained. You can also toggle the plugin on/off by clicking on the filter. Again, everything will be retained if you toggle the plugin."
