Originally, these NFTs were minted without the four distinct rarity levels: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Therefore, this crucial information isn't visible in the metadata on the jpg.store marketplace, making it challenging for collectors and enthusiasts to identify the rarity of their NFTs at a glance. Our extension elegantly solves this problem by seamlessly integrating rarity information directly into the jpg.store interface, allowing you to effortlessly view the rarity of each NFT."
