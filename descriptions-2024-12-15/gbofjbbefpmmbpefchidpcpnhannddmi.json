If you have a list of links that you would like to always have in the pinned, then this is an extension for you.\nOften it happens that all pinned tabs disappear. It is an incredible pain to remember all your links and pinn them again.\nWith TabPinner you can store all your links in it and if your pinned tabs has been lost, you can easily restore them with one click.\n\nDesign by Max Terry.
