All of them generate todo, but there doesn't seem to be a todo app in the world yet that can unify all of them and queue them up easily and securely.\n\nI don't want something that works with all those SaaS todo.\n\nI just want a todo app that allows me to queue up selected text as a todo.\n\nThis chrome extension fills that need.\n\nAfter installing it, select a sentence on a website and click \"add hub todo task\" in the context menu to add the task to your todo.\n\nThe added todo tasks will be listed in the extension popup in the upper right corner.\n\nClick the link button on the list, and the page will move to a new tab where the selected sentence will be highlighted using the \"Scroll To Text Fragment\".\n\nTodo lists can be deleted and reordered by dragging, and the lists are synchronized by Chrome.\n\nCHANGELOG \nv1.0.0 - Added the feature to add todo from the address bar (omnibox) as well.\nv1.0.1 - Fixed permissions and icon"
