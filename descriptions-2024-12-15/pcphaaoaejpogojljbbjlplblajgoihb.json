Yandex bot is a web crawler which surfs the web extensively to build a searchable index for the Yandex search engine (making it - together with Googlebot - one of the most influential Internet users. Only what it sees is indexed and can later be found by other users through Yandex search, the most popular search engine in Russia). By changing your settings to match those of Yandex bot, you become one of thousands of Yandex web crawlers browsing the web to index its contents.\n\nSurfing the web as Yandex bot gives you access to what is referred to as the grey web, a layer of content only visible to bots. In some cases it might give you access to websites and archives that are usually hidden behind a paywall. Because while the website owner will present the regular user with a login page, they will give web crawlers access to their full archive in order for it to be represented in Yandex’s search results.\n\nStep 1:\n💻 Install the web extension\n\nStep 2:\n📡 To start surfing as Yandex bot, click on the new icon in the browser toolbar\n\nStep 3:\n🏄🏾‍♀️ Surf your favourite websites\n\nStep 4:\n🌐 Check RYBN's Double Negative Capchas to see if you pass the bot test.\nhttp://www.rybn.org/projects/1000scores/\n(You might have to take the test twice until it works.)\n\nStep 5:\n🖱 Also download 1000 Bots, the addon that enables you to surf the webs as Googlebot\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1000-bots/ecpdhlloflbgbfjklnpedhiapeckiapa\nYou can compare the two bot-experiences\n\nRefuse to be human is an art piece by !Mediengruppe Bitnik commissioned by Transmediale and Open Berlin.\n\nThe source code [1] for refuse to be human is free software and published under the GNU GPLv3.\n\n<3 !Mediengruppe Bitnik\n\n[1] source code: https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/data/code/1000_bots_webextension.zip"
