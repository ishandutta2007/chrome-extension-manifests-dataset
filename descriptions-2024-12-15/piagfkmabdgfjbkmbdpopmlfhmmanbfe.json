And whenever you need a hex code, you have to hunt it down.\n\nEven if you have all the hex codes stored on a single page, you still need to have a second window or tab open, go to the page, double-click, copy, go back to Klaviyo, then paste it where you need it.\n\nYou've got no choice but to rack up \"mouse mileage\" just to get those sacred hex codes...\n\nWith the Hex Code Wizard, you can save every brand color for every brand you work with and grab the hex code you need in just 2 clicks, without leaving Klaviyo's email editor.*\n\nNo more jumping between tabs or windows, navigating bookmarks or design files, or interrupting your workflow.\n\nBring brand colors directly into Klaviyo with the Hex Code Wizard.\n\nv.1.0.2 Fixed bug where Hex Code Wizard would disappear after clicking on elements within the editor.\nv.1.0.3 Fixed bug where Hex Code Wizard would not load when opening the email editor."
