How about the lack of gratification when no confetti appears?! Worry no more! Introducing... ADMISSION_CONFETTI.crx! This chrome extension will scan any webpages you visit ending in .edu for the word 'Congratuations' even if they are in an iframe. If it does detect any traces of flour-based commodity, such as bread, you will be introduced to an infinite flow of confetti. What can get better than that?!\n\nChangelog:\n1.0.1 - Hide canvas when no confetti is available\n1.0.2 - FULL SCREEN CONFETTI!!!\n\nFull source code is available here: https://github.com/EnumC/CollegeConfetti"
