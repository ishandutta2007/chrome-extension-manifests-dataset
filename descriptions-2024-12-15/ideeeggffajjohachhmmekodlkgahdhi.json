This allows administrators to provide safe Internet access to your Chromebook users, whether theyâ€™re on or off of your network.\n\n\n- Single sign-on, user-based access.\n- Policies are cached on the Chromebook, ensuring that if it loses contact with the Barracuda Content Shield, last-known policies are still enforced. No need for the extension to fail open or closed. \n- The extension works on or off network.\n- Policies configured on the Barracuda Content Shield Portal are synchronized to the Chromebook periodically.\n- All Chromebook user access to websites is logged and the logs are available on the Barracuda Content Shield Portal.\n- Create customizable block page through the Barracuda Content Shield Portal.\n- The administrator can use the Barracuda Content Shield Portal report generation feature to generate reports on Chromebook user web access.\n- The Barracuda Chromebook Security Extension comes with the Barracuda Content Shield subscription at no additional cost!"
