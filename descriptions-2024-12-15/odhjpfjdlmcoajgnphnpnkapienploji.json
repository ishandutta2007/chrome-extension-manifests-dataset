By embedding a website as opposed to redirecting to a URL, you don't have to wait for the tab to load before typing anything into the search bar. The address bar will keep its focus (unlike on redirect), allowing you to start typing immediately without having to click anything. Optionally you can also prevent the iframe from scrolling to hide any scrollbars.\nBecause this extension uses an iframe, not all websites will allow themselves to be embedded. This includes websites like google.com and many other big-name service providers that would rather you visit their sites directly. \nThis project is open source and released under the MIT license.
