Russell is rough and tumble reporter looking to get out of the news racket by marrying and becoming a house wife after her divorce from newspaper publisher Grant. Just when she is about to leave town with her husband-to-be the still lovesick Grant drafts her to cover one final breaking news sensation.\n\nAlong with plenty of laughs and fast paced dialog this film provides a witty and cynical look at news business.\n\nThere is a slight audio sync problem in the first couple minutes of the film. It is present on the source medium and is very brief.\n\nThe Movie is yours to keep and Download just right click over film and save as."
