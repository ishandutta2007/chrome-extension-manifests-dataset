This extension adds a simple yet powerful feature that allows users to hide or unhide the chat title sidebar with a single click. Whether using the chat service in a public location or a shared space, SideHide empowers you to maintain your privacy easily.\n\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, designed to simulate human-like text conversation. Its interface shows a sidebar with a list of all your chat titles. While this is convenient for switching between conversations, it can expose sensitive information if someone glances at your screen.\n\nThis is where SideHide steps in. With our extension, you can instantly hide the chat titles in the sidebar, preventing others from seeing them. When you need to switch conversations, you can just as quickly bring the sidebar back into view. The toggle is smooth and intuitive, ensuring a seamless user experience that doesn't interrupt your conversation flow.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nOnce you've installed SideHide, you'll see an arrow icon next to the chat sidebar on chat.openai.com.\nClicking this arrow will hide the sidebar, covering up your chat titles. The arrow will then move to the left of the screen.\nTo bring back the sidebar, click the arrow again. The sidebar will slide back into view, and the arrow will return to its original position next to it.\nOur extension is designed to blend into the ChatGPT interface, offering functionality that feels like a natural part of the website. It's easy to use and doesn't require any complicated setup or configuration. All you need to do is install it, and you're ready to enjoy enhanced privacy on ChatGPT.\n\nYour privacy is important, and SideHide is here to help you protect it. Install the extension today and experience a more private, more secure ChatGPT."
