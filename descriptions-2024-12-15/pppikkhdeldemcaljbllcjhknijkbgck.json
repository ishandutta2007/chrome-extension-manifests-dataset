(Average falls between a 0.20–0.24 and 0.70–0.74)\n› See the grades needed to reach 0.25 or 0.75 in these subjects.\n\nDisclaimer: \n› I am in no way affiliated with Kanti Baden. This is a personal script created to simplify average calculations because frankly, it annoys me to calculate them every time.\n› Currently, it works exclusively with the Kanti Baden website. If your school uses Schul-Netz and you'd like support added, feel free to reach out to me.\n\nContact\n› Discord: Reazn999 (preferably)\n› Email: reazn.dev@gmail.com"
