See the included FAQ for why.\n\nIf you play Megapolis on Facebook, you will love this utility.\n\nYou like playing Megapolis and you have many neighbors, but gifting them all takes too long, and it's a lot of work to satisfy everybody.\n\nIt's also hard to keep track of which neighbors are gifting you back.  Somehow you don't get anywhere near as many gifts as you send.  So a lot of your neighbors aren't gifting you back, but which ones?\n\nGiftHelper automatically calculates an optimum gifting list.  Typically it satisfies 90% of your active neighbors on the first gifting period, and everybody else on the second period.  Very customizable; you have total control over what it does.  Or click the 1-click gift button and *bang*, it's done.\n\nGiftHelper also tracks which neighbors gifted you, and records whether the gift is on your wishlist, was recently on your wishlist, or just wasn't.  It calculates a gifting score from the accumulated data, and in a few days it's obvious who's gifting you back with assets you want and who isn't."
