By simply noting down the secret recovery phrase generated by Tonkeeper, you can start transacting, sending, and receiving Toncoin immediately.\nTON is a network designed specifically for speed and throughput. The fees are significantly lower than other blockchains, and transactions are confirmed within seconds.\n\nThe YepWallet plugin also converts the corresponding URLs on Twitter pages into the user’s Web3 interface.\n\nYepWallet analyzes the corresponding URL on the page, generates an appropriate operation interface, sends the user’s operation request to the relevant website’s API, receives the transaction data returned by the API, and uses tools like ethers.js and solana-web3.js to call the corresponding wallet, helping users complete transactions."
