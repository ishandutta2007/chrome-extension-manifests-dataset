All of the data read will be used solely for research purposes. Each document you read, you have the choice to give it a rank from 1 (the worst) to 5 (the best). Within the extension popup, you can then see the amount of Wikipedia pages you have viewed, the amount you have voted on, and the number of hours. See how many votes you can rank up!\n\nWikiSurf: Now going on pages you can \"surf\" to any other page based on the contents of your current page. This feature will continuously evolve, but will also give you an option to understand more about how this system works! Some of the suggestions are likely to be a bit of a surprise. Feel free to comment about any interesting connections you found.\n\nALL NEW! WikiRecommend: On each page when you have inputted data you can now see a few recommended pages based on all pages you have looked at. You can scroll through the page intro to see if you may like that page, and then click on it when you are ready to jump to that page!"
