Instead, this extension encourages you to close other content to focus on whatever you are doing. Alternatively, this can be a good tool if you want to speed up your browsing experience, as more tabs = more RAM = slower computer. \n\nThe extension should be pinned to the toolbar, as a badge will show up telling you how many tabs in total you currently have open. If you are well below the limit, the badge is green; otherwise, the badge will be orange, or red if you are very close to your set limit. You can change the limit by right-clicking the extension and clicking Options.\n\nThis extension is open-source, and will always be. Check out and star the repo here:\nhttps://github.com/jesalgandhi/TabCap\n\nLet me know if you like/dislike the extension, think it could use some work, want me to add a feature, or have anything else constructive to say in a review. I appreciate it!\n\nContact me at: jesalgandhi.com"
