Never again will you have 20 planetterp tabs open going back and forth trying to figure out which professor you just searched for and what their rating was. Now, just look under the name of each professor, and if planetterp has a rating, it will automatically be displayed.\n\nIn the near future, Better Testudo will also add additional filtering options to make searching classes easier. Features like removing schedule conflicts, and removing classes that you don't qualify to take automatically will make searching for classes so much easier."
