The extension automatically scans all their past comments & submissions and calculates the top five subreddits they visit based on engagement. All submissions and comments are also sent to Perspective API for analysis, providing valuable insights into users' toxicity and incivility levels. These scores are displayed only if they exceed a threshold of 75%.\n\nThe development of Reddit Insights is based on the scientific principle that enhancing the humanization of others leads to more productive and positive online discussions. The extension is open source and also available on GitHub."
