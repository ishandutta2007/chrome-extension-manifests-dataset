Bias Shield springs into action while you're using one of these online translators and gives you access to the following debiasing tools:\n\nDeBiasByUs: You can use Bias Shield to report gender-biased translations to DeBiasByUs, a project which is collecting a database of gender-biased translations. Also, Bias Shield warns you when the translation you have been given has previously been reported as gender-biased, and offers you an unbiased translation instead (if one is available).\n\nFairslator: Fairslator is an application which automatically detects and corrects machine translation biases caused by ambiguities in gender and forms of address. Bias Shield plugs Fairslator right into Google Translate and DeepL Translator, so you can use Fairslator's debiasing features without leaving their websites."
