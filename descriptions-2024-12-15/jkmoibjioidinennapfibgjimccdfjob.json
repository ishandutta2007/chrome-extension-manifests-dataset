This Wikipolicy Chrome extension replaces the names of notorious mass murderers in the US with text that takes away their narrative power and rightfully shames them for their actions. Our next version will include a link to a petition urging the media to avoid making them famous.\n\nWhen this extension is installed, you will receive a message stating that the extension needs access to your data on all websites. This is the standard message that Chrome displays for all extensions of this type. The extension works by searching webpages for text and then replacing that text on the page. No user data is collected or retained.\n\nThis is the first of a suite of extensions planned by Wikipolicy. Please follow Wikipolicy on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/WikipolicyUSA."
