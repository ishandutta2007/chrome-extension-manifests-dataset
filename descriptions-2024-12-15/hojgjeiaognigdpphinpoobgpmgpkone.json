Many of the English words that cause the most problems are those containing redundant letters. Just eliminating redundant letters solves many spelling difficulties without significantly changing the appearance and use of written English.\n\nThis idea was developed by Christopher Upward and colleagues into Cut Spelling. This simple reform removes redundant letters, along with a small number of letter substitutions, to improve English spelling and speed writing.\n\nCUTSPEL\nCutSpel implements a subset of Cut Spelling to automatically 'cut' the text of any webpage. CutSpel has two modes.\n\nBasic Mode\nModifies the 1000 most common English word language while avoiding the more disruptive Cut Spelling changes such as eye -> y. Names of people and objects are left unchanged. The text generated by this mode is very easy to read.\n\nAdvanced Mode\nModifies the 4500 most common English words and uses the full Cut Spelling substitution rules. The text produced by the advanced mode requires slightly more effort to read, however most people quickly adjust and are reading at a normal pace after only a few hours."
