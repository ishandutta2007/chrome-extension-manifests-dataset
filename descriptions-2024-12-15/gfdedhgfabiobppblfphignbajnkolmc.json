You need to have a Walmart account and be logged in order for the extension to search for appointments.\n\nOn page load, the extension will query each Walmart location shown in the \"Find a Pharmacy\" list for vaccine appointments that are available in the next seven days. If a location has appointments, they will be listed in the frame on the right side of the page.\n\nIf you update location criteria (zip/city/state or distance), the checker will automatically search for appointments again. If you want to manually check again, use the \"Check again\" button at the top of the page.\n\nYou can choose to auto-check for appointments every 20 seconds. Your must keep the website loaded for the auto-checking to happen. After running for about 15 minutes, you may have to log in again to the website. You'll get an alert if this happens."
