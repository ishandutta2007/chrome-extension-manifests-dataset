When windowed mode is set, your browser will open windows wherever possible rather than use tabs.\n\nIt is based on the extension Tab-less. Unlike the original, this version allows you to toggle between windowed and tabbed mode by clicking the icon or by using a keyboard shortcut.\n\nUpon being installed, the extension begins in tabbed mode. This mode does absolutely nothing, allowing tabs to be created without being converted into windows.\n\nTo switch to tab-less mode, click the icon. This immediately converts all open tabs into separate windows. In tabbed mode, for every instance a new tab would be created, an appropriate new window is created instead.\n\nTo switch back to tabbed mode, click the icon again.\n\nNote: switching back to tabbed mode does NOT collapse the individual windows back into tabs. If you have many tabs open and switch to tab-less mode, all the tabs will be separated into individual windows; there is no way to undo this without manually recombining the windows one by one.\n\nAll the code for this extension is open-sourced and can be found online at https://github.com/ei14/tab-less-togglable. I'd be happy to receive any feedback, hear about any bugs or accept any pull-requests for new code at that address.\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n* Why would you want to disable tabs?\n\nBecause I sometimes find it difficult to find the tab I'm looking for. Tabs can sometimes obscure the browsing experience, and I sometimes find it easier to browse the web when I can see all of my windows at once. Most modern operating systems can arrange windows elegantly and efficiently, making tabs defunct in many cases.\n\n* If you don't like tabs, then just don't use them! You don't need an extension for that\n\nIncreasingly, browsers force tabs on you by default. It does not provide an option to default to using windows rather than tabs. This extension lets you override that behaviour to open windows instead, to make it seamless for users like myself.\n\n* Why should I use Tab-less-togglable rather than New Tab, New Window?\n\n1. Tab-less-togglable does not require any access to your browsing history at all (most extensions require access to your browsing history or the current page you're viewing).\n2. It's designed to be as light-weight and simplistic as possible.\n3. There's no magic, it just moves tabs to a new window, whenever they're opened, whenever windowed mode is on (using the default settings for a new window)."
