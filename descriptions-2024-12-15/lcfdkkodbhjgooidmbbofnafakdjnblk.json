Tumblr has historically failed to provide this functionality to users, with many resorting to third party alternatives. \n\nOn Quora: On Tumblr, how do you view somebody's original posts?(https://www.quora.com/On-Tumblr-how-do-you-view-somebodys-original-posts):\n\nIf what you’re referring to is how to find someone’s original posts in their blog, that can be difficult. Some people who keep their blogs organized tend to tag their own posts. If that’s the case with that “somebody” then just find which tag they’re using for their original posts and check it out. If they don’t tag their original posts then it’s going to be quite hard to find them without navigating all the way through their blog.  \n\nUsage\n\nAdd the extension to Chrome and personally uploaded posts will now show a green indicator on a blog's archive. To toggle highlighting on/off for a blog, click the green application icon.\n\nWhy an extension?  \n\nThere exist dedicated online tools which perform this function, such as https://jetblackcode.com/TumblrOriginalPostFinder. However, these tools are trying to deliver dedicated web experiences, and impose behavior such as pagination or very limited filter/sort functionality. This extension enhances your native Tumblr browser experience, giving you the freedom to use Tumblr's own filter/sort functionality and UI. \n\nThe application is built to support Chrome 68 and above."
