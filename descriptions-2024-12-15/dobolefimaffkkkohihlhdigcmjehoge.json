Teachers have the flexibility of emailing an entire class or a select number of students at time. Classroom automatically launches Gmail with the assignment name and student emails pre-populated in an email.\n\nFor districts that use Microsoft Outlook instead of Gmail, this amazing feature is unavailable. \n\nWith Email-My-Students, teachers can unlock the full potential of the email feature. Email-My-\nStudents automatically launches Outlook with student emails and the assignment name in the subject field.  \n\n***Note: teachers must be logged in to their Microsoft Outlook for this extension to work.***\n\n***You must purchase a license to use this product (see LICENSE section below).***\n\nHow it Works:\nAfter purchasing a license, simply download Email-My-Students from the Web Store/relaunch your Chrome browser.  Make sure your browser is logged in to your Microsoft Outlook Account. \n\nThat’s it! You can use Google Classroom as you normally would.  You may need to refresh the page. When you click the mailbox icon or the ‘email’ item from the Google drop down menu, you will seamlessly create a Microsoft Outlook email that can be sent to your students.\n\nShould you want to turn off Email-My-Students, simply click on the icon in your browser and toggle it to the 'off' position.  If you have already purchased a license and Email-My-Students does not recognize your account, you may need to toggle Email-My-Students 'off' and then back 'on' again for it to recognize your license.\n\nPRIVACY & USE-OF-DATA DISCLOSURE:\nEmail-My-Students transmits the user’s email address to our servers via modern cryptography for license authentication purposes. Upon purchasing a license, the provided email address is stored encrypted on our servers.\n\nEmail-My-Students does not store, collect, share, or sell any student data at all for its own purpose or that of any third party.\n\nLICENSE:\nA yearly license for this product can be purchased for $1; volume discounts are available. Currently this app is only available to educational institutions. If you are interested in purchasing licenses for your school/district, please email us at sales@razorsparrow.com. \n\nPERMISSIONS:\nActiveTab → read data on the currently active tab in the active window\nWebNavigate → read the URL to determine if Email-My-Students should be active\nTabs → open and redirect web traffic\nStorage → save settings for the app\n\nChange Log:\nv1.0.2 - now works with both Outlook 'Bcc' field visibility settings"
