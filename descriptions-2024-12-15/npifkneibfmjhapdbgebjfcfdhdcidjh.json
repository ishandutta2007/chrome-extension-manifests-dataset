This revision heavily revamps the look, switching to softer, more neutral colors, Helvetica instead of Verdana and lots of whitespace to maximize readability.\n\nStats for each article (i.e. comments, descriptions and time posted) are completely revamped and turned into graphs on the right side of each story row. From top to bottom I reference points, comments and time posted (short bars were just posted, long bars are two days or older.) Stats are activated by row mouseover, and a hover for an additional few seconds will list the exact numbers by each graph bar. As noted in the below keyboard shortcuts, to keep stats always on (not just on mouseover), tap the s key. \n\nKeyboard shortcuts (on story listings only)\nc: Open hovered article comment link in new window\ns: Toggle statistics always on/off\nv: Open hovered article link in new window\n-: Switch to compact visual mode\n+: Switch to normal (larger) mode"
