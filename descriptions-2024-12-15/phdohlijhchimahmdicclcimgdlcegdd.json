Only review what you are soon to forget, and even focus your review sessions on problems by difficulty and type.\n\nMost people struggle with DSA because they don’t consistently revisit and practice problems they’ve already learned. Without regular review, it’s easy to forget key concepts. SpaceDSA sets you on a spaced repetition-based study routine that keeps you practicing and reinforcing past topics. Unlike other tools, SpaceDSA isn’t a curated list—use any problem list you choose and automatically schedule reviews to keep you on track. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews or honing your skills, this extension ensures you’re continuously re-engaging with problems and mastering data structures and algorithms more efficiently than ever before."
