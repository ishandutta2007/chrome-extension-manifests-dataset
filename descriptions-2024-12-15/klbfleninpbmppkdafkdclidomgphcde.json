If you develop websites and frequently find yourself wanting to switch to the development/production version of the page you're on, this addon is for you.\n\nIt is a port of the excellent Server Switcher addon for Firefox, which I had used for a long time before switching to Chrome.  The Firefox addon can be found at http://hermann.czedik.net/projekte/switcher/\n\nNote about multiple servers - I've had a number of requests in the reviews and bad reviews because I only support two servers per profile.  I have no plans to change this - my extension is for a quick switch between live/dev.  Adding more servers requires either a dropdown (2 clicks) or multiple icons, neither of which are not what I intended.  If you need support for multiple servers per profile, I suggest you try multiswitch, rather than leaving a bad review saying that my extension doesn't do what it's not intended to do!\n\nSource code for the extension can be found at https://github.com/richardlawley/server-switcher\n\nRevision History\n-----------------------\n0.3:  Updated to Manifest version 3\n0.2:  Allowed single hostnames in URL, such as http://localhost/ and http://development/\n0.1:  Initial Version"
