The game also features a discrete prank mode where the player can subtly change how they type the questions to force yes or no answers. This is great for pranking friends as you can pretend the game knows everything about them!\n\nHow to play:\n    1) Type a question in the text box at the top of the page. End the question with a question mark to submit it\n    2) The stars will align with either a yes or no answer!\n\nCheat mode:\n    Instead of typing a '?' at the end of your question, type a '/' while this mode is enabled. This will force the answer to be yes. To force a no answer in this mode, type a regular question mark. This is especially discrete (even if someone watches you type) since a '/' is just a '?' without holding SHIFT."
