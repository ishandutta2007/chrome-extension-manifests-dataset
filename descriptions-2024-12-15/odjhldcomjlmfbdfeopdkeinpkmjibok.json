Don't regularly search within your bookmarks? This extension is designed to help with this kind of problem.\n\n\n/// Features ///\n\n- When searching on a search engine the search term is also sent to your linkding instance and results are added in a new box in the sidebar right to the search engine results.\n- Supports the following search engines: google, duckduckgo, SearX/SearXNG*, Brave Search, Kagi, Qwant\n- Automatic light or dark theme detection\n\n* experimental, please read https://github.com/Fivefold/linkding-injector/wiki/SearX-SearXNG-support if you have problems\n\n\n/// Usage ///\n\nAfter installation the extension needs to be configured and connected to your linkding instance. Either open the extension options in the browser extension manager or follow the link in the new linkding injector box on the search page of google or duckduckgo.\n\nOnce the extension is properly configured linkding search results will show in the right sidebar. If there are no search results nothing will appear.\n\n\n/// Permissions ///\n\nThis extension needs to request permissions to all websites because the linkding instance URL is not known beforehand and it's not possible to send a request to the linkding instance otherwise. The only websites it actually accesses the data of are the listed search engine websites and the configured linkding instance. \n\nThe search term is sent to your configured linkding instance to get results and display them on the website. The extension saves no search-related data, only the settings of the extension itself are saved (locally). \n\nFor a more thorough explanation see here: https://github.com/Fivefold/linkding-injector/wiki/Why-request-permissions-for-ALL-websites%3F\n\n\n/// Changelog ///\n\nTo see what's changed go to https://github.com/Fivefold/linkding-injector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"
