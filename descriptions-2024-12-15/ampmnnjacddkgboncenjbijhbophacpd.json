Restrictive mode hides some things yes but not nearly enough. Plus there are no tracking/monitoring or filtering methods parents can use. On top of that the \"suggested\" and \"trending\" videos very often have content I personally wouldn't want my kids watching. \n\nThis extension is a very simple hack to hide most elements on the YouTube site and only show the basics. These lists may change over time but for now here's what is shown/hidden:\n\n----------------------\n  ITEMS SHOWN\n----------------------\n* Search Bar\n* Playlist menu/list\n* Subscriptions \n\n----------------------\n   ITEMS HIDDEN \n----------------------\n* Suggested / Next Up videos\n* Number of items in the left/side-menu on YouTube site\n* The GOD AWFUL \"Trending\" link\n* History link (harder for kids to clear history)\n* Video description\n* Video comments\n* Misc YouTube Header/Footer stuff\t\n\n----------------------\n   HOW TO USE \n----------------------\n\n1.) Install this extension. Enable it for \"Private/Incognito\" mode if necessary. \n2.) Go to YouTube\n3.) Enjoy a VERY minimal/bare-bones YouTube user interface \n    with 85% of the crap hidden.\n\n----------------------\n   DISCLAIMERS/NOTES\n----------------------\n\nA) Yes this is not super secure and anyone (incl kids) \n   of a certain age/technical skill will find ways around this \n   but it's better than nothing for people in my situation with \n   no other options.\n\nB) Please note that this extension may stop working to varying\n   degrees in the future if/when YouTube changes their site. I'll \n   update/fix if possible when time permits and/or I (or others)\n   are still using this.\n\nC) This extension is not meant to eliminate the need for parental\n   attention of what their kids are watching on YouTube - it's\n   just to help make parents' job a little bit easier and less stressful.\n\nD) This extension's toolbar icon is *intentionally* invisible so it's not\n   immediately obvious where/how to remove it. However it can be removed\n   in the usual extension/setting location.\n\nE) This extension is similar to the similarly-named extension \n   \"Safer YouTube\" by another person but that one didn't go far enough \n   (for me) in what it hides/shows so that's why I made my own. \n   Reference: https://goo.gl/TKqRtW.\n\nF) Finally, this is a test/work in progress. Please leave any \n   ideas/feedback anyone has here: \n  https://emersondesignlog.blogspot.com/2019/03/safer-youtube-ui-for-kids.html\n\n\n----------------------\n    CHANGE LOG\n----------------------\n1.0.017: YT Channel/YT Studio links removed from dropdown menu\n\n1.0.016: Adjustment requests from an end-user\n\n1.0.015: Resolving a chrome manifest V3/permission issue.\n\n1.0.014: The channel and subscribe buttons are now visible. The show-as-you-type search results is now hidden.\n\n1.0.0.13: Updated extension to V3 of Chrome manifest format. Also added few new YT items to hide on request from an end-user. \n\n20210627211035: Hiding couple additional items on YT home page (some, not all recommended \"channels/topics\").\n\n20210510075148: Google still rejecting app for configuration reasons (?) - still trying to resolve.\n\n2021042x: Google requested some configuration changes - attempting to resolve.\n\n\n20210407: Addressing some Chrome technical issue that came up and slight tweak to the extension to hide a couple more things on YT.\n\n20190319: Trying out hiding SUBSCRIBE button and AUTHOR/CHANNEL links.\nBy the way I *may* eventually make these toggles not global/hard-coded hide/show decision."
