It provides a text area where you can enter a set of search queries, such as finding emails for a particular company. Each line of the text area will generate a search button, allowing you to perform multiple searches at once. You can easily switch between search engines like DuckDuckGo, Google, and Bing, making it easier to filter and compare results dynamically. All of this happens within the same tab where the extension is open, providing a seamless and efficient search experience. This tool is ideal for researchers, data analysts, SEO specialists, digital marketers, and students or professionals who regularly perform detailed searches and prefer a streamlined, multi-query tool."
