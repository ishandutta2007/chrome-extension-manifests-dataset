When a proofpoint rewritten URL is detected, the original decoded destination of the rewritten URL will be displayed. \n\nThis extension is based upon the v0.3 release of Link Revealer\n\nThe only difference between this and the original Link Revealer, is that it has been modified to only perform the Link Reveal action on Google's Gmail website.\n\nOriginal source code can be obtained here:\nSOURCE-CODE:\nhttps://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/chrome-link-revealer"
