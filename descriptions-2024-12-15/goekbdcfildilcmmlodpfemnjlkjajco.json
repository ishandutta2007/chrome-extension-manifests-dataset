It simplifies working with repeatedly used sentences or command lines. All your data is stored offline in your own browser locally and nothing is transmitted over the network.\n\nUnlike text editors, Snippet-Fu doesn't require you to first select the text before copying which reduces chances of over-writing and errors. Unlike clipboard manager apps, Snippet-Fu keeps only what you explicitly put into it and doesn't get littered with everything copied to clipboard.\n\nDo not save passwords or other similar sensitive information in Snippet-Fu. Do not rely on Snippet-Fu as the only storage place for your data since Snippet-Fu data may be lost if Chrome data is fully cleaned."
