If you don't have the Important Dates sidebar normally, this extension will only partly work. It will still function via the popup but the list won't show up on your home page.\n\nClick an assignment to open a preview window, or right click it to go straight to it's page. Assignments due today will show up in orange and missing assignments will show up in red."
