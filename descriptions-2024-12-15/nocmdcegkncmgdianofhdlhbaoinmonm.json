I believe so.)\n\n- Can't support absolute time for reminder, e.g. 14:00 Call Mom\n- Can't support combined way of configuration , e.g. 1h20m Go Home\n- Can't cancel/stop ongoing timers\n- Help info is not so readable for newbie, especially if they don't have habit to read the webstore page\n- Peronsally I am not so in favor of the page style of option page, icon and font, etc.... but just personally\n\nThat's the reason I fork and create the extension: https://github.com/shinemoon/omnibox-timer.git ( from https://github.com/taicki/omnibox-timer.git )\n\nAnd also there is kind contribution from @nocaoper, author of Omnibox Timer FIX, who had provide pull request to merge his fix features into this one.\n\nReally thanks.\n\nHow to Use It:\n\n1. Focus in the address bar;\n2. Type 'ta' and hit space key, then you will see it invokes extension prompt for further input;\n3. Use syntax like below example to define the reminders for timer;\n    + [Number]s|m|h [Reminder Description](e.g. 10m Have Dinner) , or\n    +  hh:mm [Reminder Description] (e.g. 20:20 Go Home)\n4. Reminder will pop up by defined time;\n5. Options and Timers can be managed via this page.\n\nPatch contributed by @nocaoper:\n1. Support the quick clear function in address bar : after the Omnibox Timer Activated , type 'clr' and return, you can clean all reminders;\n2. Prediction in alarm time when user typing in the address bar;"
