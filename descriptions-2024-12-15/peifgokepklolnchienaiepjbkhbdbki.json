And you probably do one of these two things.\n\n1. You leave the tab open... And another one. And then another one... This can quickly get messy!\n2. You save it to bookmarks, but it introduces a disorder among the important stuff you keep there - besides, bookmarks are not so lightweight to manage. At least not by one click.\n\nWell, FleetMarks try to be something in-between.\n\nThis browser plugin introduces lightweight bookmarks. They are accessible with one click in one place. You can easily add a page to FleetMarks and close its tab within one operation. And when you open the bookmark, it disappears from the list.\n\nIsn't it wonderful?! Well, I guess it's not - let's have some respect to the superlatives.\n\nBut it's still pretty cool, right?"
