Add a simple, 2-click BUY BUTTON to any site in the world for buyers to receive guarantee payment upfront - Verihold immediately secures buyers' funds in PayPal's escrow account.\n* Put another way: sellers get paid upfront (without completing the transfer) before potentially wasting their time on unsure or \"scammy\" buyers who need to \"see the item.\"\n* Buyers pay in only 2 clicks.  After click #2, buyers have placed a hold (all the work necessary on the buyer side).\n* When buyers \"hold\" an item, PayPal secures the funds, keeping them in its escrow account until the item has transferred. \n* Sellers confirm transfer (either via shipping or local meetup), at which point the funds move from PayPal's escrow account into the seller's PayPal account.\n* Both buyers & sellers* receive PayPal protection\n\n*Sellers only receive protection for shipped items.  Only buyers receive full PayPal protection for transfers that occur via local meetup.\n\nGreat for:\n- Quickly getting rid of expensive electronics and giving buyers a \"money back guarantee\" so they aren't worried about defects.\n- Guaranteeing the authenticity of a designer brand accessory or garment\n- Alleviating concerns around faulty autos (since buyers always have complete PayPal protection)\n- Selling tickets when you can't make it to the game last minute\n- So many other use cases\n\nEnjoy Verihold Everywhere!"
