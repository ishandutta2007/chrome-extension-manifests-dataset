This extension is about wave spamming, where you control a small triangle, the wave, that moves up and down as you tap or click the screen. Your goal is to get the wave through the tight spaces without hitting the edges.\n\nThis is a great way to improve your skills and get better at wave spamming in Geometry Dash.\n\nWhether youâ€™re a noob or a pro this extension will help you get better at those hard levels that require fast tapping or clicking."
