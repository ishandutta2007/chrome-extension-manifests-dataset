This works across teams and even environments, and it doesn't require authentication.\n\nTo get started:\n1. Visit a project you wish to copy\n2. Open the extension popup and click the copy button\n3. Now go to the project into which you are trying to transfer the data (if you are trying to duplicate a project, you would create an empty one in this step)\n4.Open the extension popup, and in the paste area uncheck any data that you do not wish to transfer over\n5. Click the paste button and leave the popup open until the process is finished (you will be notified of progress and completion)"
