Break their websites or subtly mess with them. It is all just harmless fun.\n\nPage Pranker edits the websites you visit to make them look different. You can change the frequency of these edits and change how much they affect the websites. The extension is always on, and works in the background.\n\nThis extension is heavily inspired by the Prank 'em extension, but i got tired of waiting for new updates and wanted more spice to my trolls. I will update this extension more in the future and add lots of cool stuff"
