This extension tracks your weekly habits and how well you are following them. Perhaps you want to start meditating, or read for 3 days a week - with its customizability, you can clearly and easily track your progress.\n\nThe Advice panel is tailored to your performance - do well, and perhaps you can do more. Struggle, perhaps, and Habivator will try to help.\n\nDo give feedback in the support form - this is still under active development.\nIf you have any ideas, please send to josephch405@gmail.com\nSource on Github:\nhttps://github.com/josephch405/Habivator"
