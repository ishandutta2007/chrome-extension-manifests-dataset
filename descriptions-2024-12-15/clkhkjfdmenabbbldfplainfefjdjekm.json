Meeting Caller will play a sound to alert you when a meeting starts. You can accept or reject the call within the extension and accepting the call will open the Google Meet in a new tab!\n\nYour calendar is checked every 10 minutes for updates and will show you your meetings for the next 12 hours. Settings allows you to control which meeting response types calls you. Maybe you only want accepted meetings to call you, this defaults to accepted, maybe and \"requires action\".\n\nThis extension does not store/use any of your calendar data other than to display it to you and to set the alarms.\n\nAs per Google's strong suggestion, your authorisation token is not stored in Chrome storage. Once logged in, your token is stored as a local variable that can only be accessed by this extension."
