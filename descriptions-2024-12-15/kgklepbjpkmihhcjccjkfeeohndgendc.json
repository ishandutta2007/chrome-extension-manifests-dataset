It takes one click to save a webpage offline, and another click to cite it in the AMA, APA, MLA, or Turabian / Chicago formats.\n\nSave Webpage to EazyPaper is open source (https://gitlab.com/eazypaper/save-webpage-to-eazypaper/), but supported by a commercial company (https://eazypaper.com) so you get timely support. It saves all the website images and code in a single MHTML file, making it easier to move the archive file around without breaking the saved webpage.\n\nThe EazyPaper addon to Microsoft Word (https://eazypaper.com/download) will read the website, book, magazine, newspaper, or journal articles that you saved with this extension and create the AMA, APA, MLA, or Turabian / Chicago Manual of Style citation for you. So not only can you save the source article in a single click, but you can cite it in another."
