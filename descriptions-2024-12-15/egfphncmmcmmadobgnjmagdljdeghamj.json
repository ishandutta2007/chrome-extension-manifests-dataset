Try a free trial at www.routific.com to optimize thousands of stops. \nNeed a transit or cycling route?  Sorry, we can’t do that yet! But check out our other recommended apps:\n🚌For public transit: https://www.routific.com/blog/google-maps-alternatives#best-google-maps-alternatives-for-public-transport\n\n🏃For running: https://www.routific.com/blog/running-route-planner\n\n🥾🚲For hiking and biking: https://www.routific.com/blog/google-maps-alternatives#best-google-maps-alternatives-for-outdoor-activities-hiking-running-and-biking\n\nWHAT’S SO GREAT ABOUT ROUTE OPTIMIZATION?\n✅ Less time on the road\n✅ Lower gas bills\n✅ Lower emissions\n\n**WHY ARE WE GIVING THIS AWAY FOR FREE? WHAT’S THE CATCH?**\nPaid subscriptions to Routific start at $49 a month, so why is this Chrome extension free? Two reasons:\n🌲 A lot of harmful vehicle emissions are totally unnecessary. Our mission is to make route optimization available to everyone, so those emissions can be eliminated.\n🟩 Many people only need to optimize a route a couple of times a year. A paid subscription makes no sense for them, and we can afford to offer this basic service free.\n\n**Google Maps is a trademark of Google LLC.
