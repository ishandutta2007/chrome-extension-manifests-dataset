Using the extension, Robotic Process Automation developers can build sophisticated web automation workflow using the Sutherland Robility RPA Platform. The plugin allows granular controls to inspect html elements on a web page like text box, images, buttons, tabs, text and more. \n\n\nAbout the platform\n\n\nRobility platform contains a comprehensive dashboard that tracks data, resources, team member responsibilities and the status of each existing project. It offers the ability to adjust to the required level of technical detail when tracking activity, events, or ownership. In addition, this module delivers the convenience of being able to add, delete or swap tasks in a project.\n\nRobot Monitor: This virtual resource control system facilitates efficient monitoring and control of the entire intelligent automation platform. This module can integrate with several different robots, application, environmental and human interactions from one centralized platform \nRobot Deployment: This single click, web-based source code development management platform is responsible for launching the best version of a robot in the cloud or on an internal server. This module can launch all deployment ready code, following functionality testing and the security testing sign-off process via the platform. Using an \"on-the-fly\" deployment (patent pending) method, all source codes, environment settings, libraries, binaries and shared objects are deployed to the user acceptance testing phase or to the live environment by the push of a button. This module also provides a \"last working point\" restoration feature in case of an emergency\nMultiple Deployment Models - On-premise, IaaS, PaaS, and hybrid options\nActive Directory Integration - Work directly in Orchestrator with your Enterprise AD users and groups\nSecurity - Role-based segregation and isolation of resources with a Role-Based Access Control system covering all aspects of the platform\nDeployment – With a single click, manage the release of process automation updates to robot groups for execution\nMonitoring, Logging and Audit - All user and robot actions can be tracked, resulting in quicker and cleaner audit reports\nCentralized License Management – All module licenses are available on tap for resources to consume when required, rather installing licenses on PCs.\nCustom Dashboards-RPA products have standard dashboards leaving users without a choice to configure custom dashboards. Robility has standard dashboards and provides users with flexibility to configure their own dashboard, as well.\nProlific Project Management- Robility project management layers enable the robot development for multiple clients without having to compromise security protocols.\nCredential Manager: Credential Manager is a single consolidated vault that provides secure storage and management of robot credentials. All robots are hosted via a secured Representational State Transfer (REST) application program interface system which is protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security technology."
