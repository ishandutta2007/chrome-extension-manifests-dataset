I often need to record instructional videos. Before recording, there are many privacy protection preparations to be made, such as hiding the bookmarks bar, hiding the top toolbar, and hiding the browser extensions I am using.\n\nThe browser does not provide a feature to hide all pinned browser extensions with one click, so I developed a plugin.\n\nThis plugin is suitable for the following scenarios:\n\nWhen content creators start recording videos;\nWhen teachers start giving lectures;\nWhen developers conduct team technical sharing;\nWhen employees start internal meeting screen sharing;\n\nIn these scenarios, you can enable browser privacy protection with one click by hiding all pinned browser extensions.\n\nAt the same time, you get a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing interface, which also makes sharing itself more focused."
