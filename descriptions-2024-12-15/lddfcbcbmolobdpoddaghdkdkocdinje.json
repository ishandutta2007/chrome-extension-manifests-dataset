You can use this extension to explain complex pieces of text in plain English and simplify your writing.\n\nFor example, Jargon will help you convert the following complex paragraph:\n\nGenerating new kidneys using tissue engineering technologies is an innovative strategy for overcoming the shortage of donor organs for transplantation. Here we report how to efficiently engineer the kidney vasculature of decellularized rat kidney scaffolds by using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs)-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs). In vitro, hiPSC-ECs responded to flow stress by acquiring an alignment orientation, and attached to and proliferated on the acellular kidney sections, maintaining their phenotype. The hiPSC-ECs were able to self-organize into chimeric kidney organoids to form vessel-like structures.\n\nTo this:\nSince there aren't enough donor organs for everyone who needs one, scientists are trying to figure out how to make new kidneys using tissues that you can grow in a lab. Here we describe a way to make blood vessels in rat kidneys by using human cells that can turn into any kind of tissue (known as induced pluripotent stem cells). These cells can turn into the kind of cells that line blood vessels in the kidney. In a test tube, human stem cell-derived endothelial cells (cells that line blood vessels) responded to the physical stress of being pushed around by blood flow by lining up and attaching to the walls of blood vessels. They also grew in groups and formed tiny organs that looked like parts of a kidney. \n\n\n\nWhy Jargon?\nJargon will help you save time by quickly explaining complex pieces of text. You will not need to google words individually, nor will you need to pay experts to translate documents for you.\n\nThis is particularly useful for writers, scientific communicators, students, academic researchers, copywriters, and/or anyone trying to understand and/or communicate complicated pieces of text.\n\nHow it works\n1. Open the extension\n2. Copy the piece of complicated text you wish to translate\n3. Paste the complicated text into Jargon.\n4. Jargon translates this to plain English. \n5. You can also refresh this translation to get an alternative translation."
