It allows you to change the image, name and conversion text for each currency and even hide unused currencies.\nYou can have as many custom currencies as you want for as many different characters as you want. All this information is also shared across all your devices where you have the extension installed, so the currency will always be correct.\nYou can export and import the currencies and what characters use those currencies, so that everyone in your party can quickly be using the custom currency."
