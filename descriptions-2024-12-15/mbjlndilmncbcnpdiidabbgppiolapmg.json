Created by a team of neurodivergent developers, the extension utilizes a unique approach to transform web pages into text that is easier to read, emphasizing certain parts of words to guide the reader's eyes along the page. This feature is particularly useful for individuals with ADHD, dyslexia, and other neurodiverse conditions that may affect their reading abilities.\n\nOne of the challenges for neurodivergent individuals is processing the letters and words on a page. This can be especially difficult when there is a lot of text to read, as the process of scanning each individual letter and word can be time-consuming and exhausting.
