We believe that in allowing one to decide what content they engage with, and when, twitter will become a more accessible space for people affected by trauma and anxiety.\n\nIn light of recent events, many people, especially minorities and activists, have had to step away from their Twitter feeds due to a lack of control over an enormity of increasingly upsetting content. Now more than ever, we need to be enabling these people to participate and be heard on popular social media platforms. With Twitter Savior, we aim to let people choose if they are in a mindspace where they can productively and safely interact with content that might, if shown without warning, be upsetting. By quieting the din, it becomes possible to speak without having to listen to every voice, on every topic."
