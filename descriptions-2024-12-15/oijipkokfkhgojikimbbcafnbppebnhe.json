It also obviously cannot work when Adobe Flash (or another plugin) is focused, as this captures key presses).\n\n-- Tip: if you use a keyboard key or mouse button that does not appear to work in Last Tab Back, you can set up a custom key in the options page. Click on the box and try your key. If this still doesn't work, you might be able to set up a custom key in the keyboard or mouse software (possibly only for Chrome) and then try setting the custom key again in the options page. --\n\nPressing backspace / a custom key / clicking the LastTabBack button will go back as usual, until there are no such pages. Then it will close the tab and go back to the tab that opened this one.\n\nThis allows you to open new tabs and then go back where you came from without having to remember whether it was a new tab or a normal click to navigate - pressing backspace will take you back to the results either way.\n\nYou can also press Ctrl+Backspace to just go back to the tab that opened this one without closing the current tab, if you wish to leave this page to view later.\n\nThe extension also modifies the usual tab behavior to go back to the tab that opened this one when you close a tab.\n\n--\n\nCheck out my other extension - search the web store for tabtiles.\n\n--\n\nRelease history:\n0.8.0.3 - Manifest V3 updates and other bug fixes\n0.7.3 - Changed the custom key system to allow shift key modifiers  e.g. Shift + Chosen Key (for more flexibility with non-standard mouse button binding)\n0.7.2 - Fixed a bug where clicking on a Google Search result was occasionally selecting the owner tab.\n0.7.0 - Initial release"
