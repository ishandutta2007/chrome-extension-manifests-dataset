The definitions come from Wiktionary, but have been preprocessed to reduce formatting and provide faster lookup. Hold a modifier key (Alt on Windows, Command on Mac, Ctrl on Linux) and double-click or select any word to look it up - an inline box will open to the dictionary entry of that word, usually including examples, audio pronunciation and synonyms.\n\nYou can also lookup manually-entered queries using a shortcut which displays a small query form.\n\nNOTES:\n1. After installing, pages already open will not work for looking up - just refresh them and it'll be solved.\n2. The Chrome Extensions Gallery pages don't allow lookup (or any on-page extensions) for security reasons. \n3. This extension does not add a toolbar icon.\n\nIcon:\n  http://www.iconarchive.com/show/buuf-icons-by-mattahan/Dictionary-icon.html\n  Created by Paul Davey, used as per the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.\n\nIf you want to select different dictionaries, try Inline Search & Lookup:\n  https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pebegifiepdlicjchldkdlmbohhhpcfi"
