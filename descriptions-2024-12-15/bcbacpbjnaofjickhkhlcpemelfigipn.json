This tool parses uploaded templates and allows you to fill them out with selected text from your current tab\n\nNotes\n- Text you want to be templated in your cover letter should be surrounded by %t, e.g. %tCompany%t\n- Your files are stored solely in chrome session storage, which means they're cleared as soon as you close your browser\n- If you include %tDate%t (case sensitive) in your template, it will be prefilled with the current date\n\nFeatures\n- Never forget text you meant to replace again!  The tool ensures that you've replaced every templated target before allowing for file generation\n- Hotkeys that allow you to cycle between template targets and select highlighted text without ever having to open the extension popup"
