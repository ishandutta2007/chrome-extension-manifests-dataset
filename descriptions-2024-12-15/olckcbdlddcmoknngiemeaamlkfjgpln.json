Compass is a platform that guides publishers and the public from contaminated news sources to legitimate websites, a crucial task during emergencies or last-minute news. Compass shows in a simple graphical interface the information available on the web with a clear indicator of  reliability of the sources, helping journalists to identify the false viral news. Compass combines Machine Learning algorithms to verify the reliability of the sources and the journalistic activity that monitors, certifies and trains the machine. Compass platform is winner of Google DNI Fund and of the Seal of Excellence of the European Union. With the aim of enriching the contents of the Compass platform and allowing experts and journalists to focus on specific news so as to start the fact-checking process, Catchy has created a plugin for Compass. SMART Compass allows users who install it to choose any article they are reading on the web and that they do not consider reliable, to insert it as a source of news in the compass platform, to vote for it and to allow other experts to express their own preference in terms of reliability. SMART Compass is a project part of the EU Tender \"Smart 2017/0090 mechanisms that shape social media and their impact on society\"."
