It will skip all the extras that Ryanair offers such as paid seats, additional luggage, additional insurance or car hire. It will also fill out the passenger details from the passengers saved in your myRyanair account, in order in which they appear there.\n\nHow to use:\nGo to ryanair.com, make sure you are logged in to your myRyanair account (because the passenger details are filled from there), make sure the site language is set to English (as this helps find the buttons to click), select your flights and click the skipping button.\n\nThis extension is in beta phase, you can report bugs and feature requests in the Support tab."
