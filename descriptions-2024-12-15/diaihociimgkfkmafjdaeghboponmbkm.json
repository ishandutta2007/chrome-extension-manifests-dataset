It's extremely simple to use, lightweight, secure, simply pin the extension, click save workspace to save all tabs in the current window, click view workspaces to see all your saved workspaces, and then to reopen a workspace, simply click the play button at the top right of the workspace. If you no longer need a workspace, simply click the x button. But if you didn't mean to do it, its ok, go to the recently deleted tab to see the last four of your most recently deleted workspaces."
