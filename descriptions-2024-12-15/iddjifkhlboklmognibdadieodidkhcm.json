Do you need invoices from AliExpress for your administration and book-keeping or any other purposes?\n\nAs you already know, most of the suppliers from AliExpress, for whatever reason, won’t send you an invoice when you need it.\n\nOf course, you can change the supplier, but sometimes there aren’t any other good ones with items you need.\n\nYou can view and print details about each order from your account on AliExpress. But if you have shipped the order to your customer’s address directly, as often is the case with a dropshipping business model, there will be their name and address on order details page, and yours or your company’s name isn’t mentioned anywhere.\n\nYes, you could print screen and edit the page in some image editing software, but this can be time-consuming. You could be spending hours doing just that. You could hire a virtual assistant too.\n\nOr, you could be using the simplest solution, Ali Invoice.\n\nUsing Ali Invoice, you can generate an invoice in a single click, for every order you have ever placed on AliExpress! One more click and you can print it or save it as PDF.\n\nAfter installing the extension, you need to enter your details. \n  1. Click on the AliInvoice icon\n  2. Select Options\n  3. Enter required details\n  4. Click on the Save button\n\nUsing AliInvoice, on AliExpress website\n  1. Open My Orders page\n  2. Click on Ali Invoice button\n  3. Done"
