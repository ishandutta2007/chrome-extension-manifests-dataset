Fearless Wallet provides the best user experience, fast performance, and secure storage for your accounts.\n\nFearless Wallet is a Non-Custodial, Decentralized and Open-Source Web application for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems with the best UX, performance, and, most importantly, security.\n\nMulti-asset/network support.

It allows users to move their assets between relay chains and/or parachains.\n\ndApp operations\n\nDue to the Beacon SDK and a special logic integrated, the App can give users an access to the vast number of dApps. Moreover dApp transactions can be signed either by the Web application itself or by the Mobile version of the Wallet as external signer which in fact is a more secure way of operating with dApps.\n\nExpert insights\n\nToken fiat rates and total balance fiat equivalents in USD and other currencies can also be viewed within the application using the Coingecko REST API.\n\nRobust account management\n\nView your transaction history, both in summary and in detail.
