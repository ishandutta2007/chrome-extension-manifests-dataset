search bookmarks\n* `/h <query>` - search browser history\n* `/w <query>` - search the tabs in the current window only\n* `/p <query>` - search pinned tabs only\n* `/g <query>` - search tabs that belong to the same tab group as the current tab (or no tab group if it's not in a group)\n\n### Search Types\n\nYou can now change the search type for a single search, this can help if you have a specific search string in engine combo in mind.\n\n* `/fuzzy <query>` - use the fuzzy search engine for this query only \n* `/fuse <query>` - use the fuse search engine for this query only \n* `/regex <query>` - use the regex search engine for this query only \n* `/subs <query>` - use the subs search engine for this query only \n\n### Tab Management\n\nTab management commands all accept RegExp search queries.\n\n* `/close <query>` - search for and close tabs\n* `/merge <query>` - merge tabs into the current window\n* `/split <query>` - split tabs and move them into a new window\n* `/reload <query>` - reload all the tabs in the search result\n* `/mute <query>` - mute the tabs in the search result\n* `/unmute <query>` - unmute the tabs in the search result\n* `/group <query>` - create new tab groups or move tabs into groups using the search results\n\n# PERMISSIONS\n\nQuick Tabs requires the following:\n\n* **Read and change your browsing history**: _read only_ access is required to record your open tabs and search browser history.\n* **Read and change your bookmarks**: _read/write_ access is required to search, display and remove (by clicking the 'x' in the results list) bookmarks.\n\n\n# SCREENSHOTS\n\n#### Quick Tabs ready for action.\n\n![Popup Screenshot](screenshots/in_action.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Tab and bookmark search.\n\n![Search Screenshot](screenshots/searching_tabs.png?raw=true)\n\n#### History search.\n\n![Search History](screenshots/searching_history.png?raw=true)\n\nSearch your browser history by starting your search with '/h ' or adding 3 spaces to the end of your search query.\n\n#### Decide what to show.\n\n![Search History](screenshots/go_minimal.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Custom CSS styling.\n\n![Search Screenshot](screenshots/custom_css.png?raw=true)\n\nIn this case https://userstyles.org/styles/99938/better-styling-for-chrome-extension-quick-tabs by @Bunnyslippers.  See the [./3rdParty/css](./3rdParty/css) directory.\n\n\n# SOURCE\n\nThe source code for this extension is available on [github](http://github.com/babyman/quick-tabs-chrome-extension), please feel free to inspect it before you install this extension, especially as I am asking permission to interact with your computer and its private data.\n\nYou can also install it manually if you want to be certain that the source code on github is directly what you install. Note, this will NOT automatically update the extension when bugs are fixed and features are added.\n\nIn your terminal, `cd` to the folder you want to clone it to, and run `git clone https://github.com/babyman/quick-tabs-chrome-extension`. Then in Google Chrome, click `Window - Extensions`, click the checkbox called \"Developer Mode\", and click the \"Load unpacked extension\" button. Navigate to the cloned project, and select the \"quick-tabs\" folder. You now have the plugin loaded as a developer. Again, this will NOT automatically update the extension when bugs are fixed and features are added.\n\n\n# FEEDBACK AND BUGS\n\nPlease report all your valuable feedback, feature requests and bug reports on the github [issues page](http://github.com/babyman/quick-tabs-chrome-extension/issues) for this extension.\n\n# AND FINALLY\n\nIf you find Quick Tabs useful and want to buy me a coffee, I really like coffee :D ...\n\n[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V71963F)\n\n\n# RELEASE NOTES\n\n2024.11.26 - merged PR #377 to resolve Quick-Tabs no longer works for \"installed\" pages, thank you @Wizek (and @rb-109).
