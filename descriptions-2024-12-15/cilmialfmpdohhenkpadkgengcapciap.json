Eight of these triangles are identical, but one is different and marked uniquely. To increase game difficulty, each triangle is rotated randomly, with a black line beneath it indicating its orientation.\n\nHow to Play:\n\n1. Just click on the extension icon in the browser, you'll be presented with a grid of nine triangles and a section at the top showing your points and time left.\n2. Click on the one you think is different. It will light up red.  \n3. If you're right, you get 5 points and automatically move to the next round. If you're wrong, keep guessing by clicking on another triangle.\n4. You can keep playing to get as many points as you can until the time runs out.\n\nTips to Win:\n\n- In your quick review of the grid, focus more on any triangle that noticeably differs from the rest in triangle area. \n- Find the right mix of quickness and precision to boost your score the most.\n\nGood luck and enjoy the game!\n\nCHANGELOG\n==========\nVersion 0.1.1\n- Add google analytics\n\nVersion 0.1.0\n- Initial release of game"
