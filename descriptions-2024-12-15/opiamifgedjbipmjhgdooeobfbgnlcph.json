This includes all header bidding and ad tech partners.\n\n- Speed comparison — Rank the performance of your page against hundreds of other  websites.\n\n- Actionable advice — Discover customized recommendations for optimizing user experience and balancing monetization.\n\nAd tech overload is slowing down websites and negatively impacting user experience. While publishers are gaining more control over their advertising technologies, they are still met with a convoluted web of tech providers, ad calls and tags all impacting their performance. Now more than ever publishers need a tool that tells them exactly how long it takes ad tech partners to respond, the advertising to load, and their content to deliver.\n\n---\n\nBy installing the app, you agree to these terms and conditions: https://www.openx.com/ad-footprint-terms-service/\n\nPrivacy policy: http://www.openx.com/legal/"
