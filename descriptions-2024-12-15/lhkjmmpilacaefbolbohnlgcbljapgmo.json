This is what you've been looking for.\n\nShortcut Gallery BS extends the user interface, providing a larger and customizable homepage where you can easily add, remove, export, and import (to/from txt file) links that you always want to have with you.\n\nHow to control:\n•\tTo add a new link, click on the plus icon on the right side.\n•\tDrag and drop links inside the gallery to change their position.\n•\tTo edit existing links, click on the pencil icon on the right side. A new menu will be available where you can:\n   o\tclear all links,\n   o\timport,\n   o\texport,\n   o\tadjust preferences (sizes and colors).\"\n\n\nDon't worry about spy software. The extension does not send information anywhere. The only things stored on your computer are the list of links, their descriptions, and the visual settings of the app (handled by Chrome extension storage).\n\nShortcut Gallery BS can be downloaded for free, but if you like and use the extension, you're more than welcome to show your appreciation and donate for a snack. Thanks for all the support!\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FA768YQGZX8V8"
