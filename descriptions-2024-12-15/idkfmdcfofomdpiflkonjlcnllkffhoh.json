Enables quick toggling between Student View and regular view without extra navigation. \n\nNOTE: as of its December 19, 2020 release, Canvas implements its own built-in Student View link on most pages. This extension now is preset to become hidden on pages where the built-in link is shown, but other options can be selected (see Options page for more info).\n\nThis extension ONLY works with Canvas URLs of the following types: \n\nhttps://*.instructure.com/*\nhttp://*.instructure.com/*\nhttps://canvas.gu.se/*\n\nFor other URL formats, use Canvas Quick Student View (any host), link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-quick-student-view/hlhfhggndbcoolimgcohdegdfpcbphhj\n\nPlease find the complete manual at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZKHJh4_61pG4fbn743XW4qTAUCr41xaI?usp=sharing\n\nPlease join  https://groups.google.com/d/forum/canvas-quick-student-view for questions, bug reports etc."
