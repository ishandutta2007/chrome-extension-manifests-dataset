During my journey, I found myself frequently opening new tabs to refer back to previous lessons, projects, or documentation. \n\nMy extension leverages Chrome's side panel to give quick acess to the table of contents of FCC's curriculum. It also displays contents for the MDN web dev learning guide aswell as references from W3Schools. With a simple click, you can open any content element in your current tab or in a new tab group.  I've also integrated a search bar, enabling swift navigation through the entire FCC curriculum aswell as MDN and W3School docs.\n\n Happy learning! ðŸ˜€"
