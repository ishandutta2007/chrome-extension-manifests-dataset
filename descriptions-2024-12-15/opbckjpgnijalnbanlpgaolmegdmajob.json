Limit is an extension that allows you to set time limits for distracting websites.\n\nWhen you control your time on distracting websites, youâ€™ll find you have far more time to focus on the things that matter most.\n\nTo use Limit, simply enter the websites you find distracting and choose a daily time limit. For example, you could limit yourself to ten minutes a day on Facebook, or half an hour a day on Duolingo.\n\n\n- You can add or delete any website from the list of sites \n- Open source and free to use.\n- Your data not saved, your privacy is ensured.\n- Add features as your own wishes.\n\nLiLimit is a product by Yoni Shieber, in order to improve the well-being alongside user's privacy, and contributing the open source committee.\nLearn more about the project: github.com/jonis100/LiLimit\n\nThe main idea come from my expending too much time on Linkedin. That is the reason of the name. \n\nI hope you find LiLimit to be a simple and useful tool for developing healthier online habits and routines."
