This extension will append sponsorship information to the first mention of a politician's name on a webpage. \n\nThe sponsorship information includes the top 3 corporate PAC contributors to that politician's campaign and leadership PAC in the most recent election cycle. This is money received from the PAC controlled by a corporation, non-profit, labor union, trade group, or health organization, and not money that individuals associated with the company donate directly to a candidate. This extension does not include information on contributions to Super PACs, which are able to accept unlimited funds from corporations, but are not associated with specific candidates.\n\nPlease note that some data, particularly for newly elected candidates is not yet available, and that the format of some websites prevents this data from being displayed. Updates over time will increase the completeness of the data.\n\nData is from OpenSecrets.org, the website of the Center for Responsive Politics."
