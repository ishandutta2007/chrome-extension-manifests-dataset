By using this extension a small percentage (4% for most items) of each purchase you make at Amazon will be given to the PTSA to help fund all of the great programs that the PTSA supports. This doesn't cost you any extra, but benefits your community.\n\nThis extension allows you to support the PTSA EVERY time you shop at Amazon without having to remember to start from a particular link or bookmark. It works by simply adding the Mercer affiliate tag to the URL. You won't notice this unless you look closely at the URL, it simply works in the background as you browse.\n\nNote to Amazon Smile users: since the Amazon Affiliate program offers a higher percentage to the PTSA for most (if not all) purchases (4% rather than 0.5% on most items) the extension redirects you to Amazon (www.amazon.com) rather than (smile.amazon.com) to capture more revenue for the PTSA. Don't worry, you're still supporting the PTSA. If you prefer to use Amazon Smile (perhaps to support a different organization for a particular purchase), you can simply disable this extension."
