They added another column on the right side of every board. As it's a great idea to onboard new users, for existing superusers it's disturbing. The \"Add a list...\" button just wastes space on the screen. Especially for boards with a few columns / lists, the additional button will add a horizontal scroll bar. Which has a negative impact on the user experience.\n\nThis Chrome extension solves the problem:\n1. Install the extension\n2. Refresh the browser tabs with Trello boards \n3. And the \"Add a list...\" button is hidden\n\nMore at http://manuelgruber.com/trello-clean\n\n\nFYI\nIf you want to add new lists to your board, just go to the installed extensions (chrome://extensions/). There you can disable and enable the extension."
