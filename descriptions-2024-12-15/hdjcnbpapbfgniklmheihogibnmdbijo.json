Such loops of watching the same two videos over and over again (worst case) are not necessarily desirable. This is why this browser extension can choose a different autoplay video to be played next (foreground tabs) or redirect the site if the video has already been watched (background tabs). For this purpose, a URL history is recorded by the extension. The add-on allows for customization options, e.g., if playlists shall be considered as video candidates, under which circumstances the URL history shall be cleared and how large the time intervals for site analysis shall be.\n\nSince v1.1, whitelists / blacklists, maximum video lengths and recommendation numbers are supported. Users can display the URL history to the extension's background page. The permissions are less demanding.\n\nFor a more detailed and/or technical description of the project, please visit the corresponding GitHub page: https://github.com/daniel-rychlewski/stop-autoloop\nIf you would like to support my work, I would appreciate any donation amount on my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/danielrychlewski"
