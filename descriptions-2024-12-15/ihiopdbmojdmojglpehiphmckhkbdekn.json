Great for studying composition on any image across the web!\n\nTo use it, simply click the extension icon to apply dynamic symmetry grids to all images and videos on a web page.\nClick the icon in the bottom left corner of any grid to split the grid in half!\n\nWorks great on ArtStation, Pixiv, Pinterest, DeviantArt, Twitter, Google, YouTube, and more!\nIf there's ever a site that doesn't work, simply open the image in a new tab, or combine this extension with the Imagus extension!\n\nBut what's that you say? You've got an image on your computer that you want to study? Drag that image into Chrome and apply the grid that way!\n\nNow get out there and go crazy with your new grid!"
