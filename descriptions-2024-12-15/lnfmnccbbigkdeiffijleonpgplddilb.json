But what about metadata? There are many configurations in your Salesforce environment and sometimes you need to review them: can you export those? You can copy and paste those configurations, but that is slow and tedious... Is there something easier? \n\nThis extension CAN DO IT!\nSelect which configuration you want to export and submit your request: the extension will connect to your Salesforce organization, extract the data, process it and create a XLSX/JSON/CSV file.\nSometimes the extraction is complex and it might take a few minutes: there is no need to keep the extension open and stare at it while it finishes the elaboration. You can close it, keep working, grab a cup of coffee and open it later to download your extraction file.\n\nHere's a list of extractions that can be executed:\n-APPLICATIONS\n-CUSTOM LABELS\n-CUSTOM METADATA SEARCH\n-CUSTOM SETTINGS SEARCH\n-DASHBOARDS FOLDERS SHARE\n-DASHBOARDS REPORTS\n-DEPLOYMENT STATUS\n-FIELDS\n-FIELDS PERMISSIONS\n-FIELDS TRANSLATIONS\n-FIELDS USAGE\n-FIELDS USAGE %\n-FLOWS\n-LAYOUTS\n-LAYOUTS ASSIGNMENTS\n-LIGHTNING HOMEPAGES\n-LIGHTNING PAGES ASSIGNMENTS\n-LIGHTNING PAGES COMPONENTS\n-LIST VIEWS\n-OBJECTS PERMISSIONS\n-QUERY\n-RECORD ACCESS\n-RECORD DETAILS\n-RECORD TYPE ASSIGNMENTS\n-REPORTS\n-REPORTS FOLDERS SHARE\n-SHARING RULES\n-USERS\n-VALIDATION RULES\n\nThese features are limited in the free version: you can buy a license in order to get all the functionality."
