We plan to accomplish this through increasing security for web3 users and providing a on chain “Coinbase Earn” type program for teaching users about the Solana dApp ecosystem. These two features will lower the barrier to entry for passive holders and help enable them to become active web3 users.\n\n\n\nHow it Works:\n\nSecurity\nOne of the biggest problems facing crypto users is the issue of security. Phishing links, “copycat” websites, and hacks are common dangers web3 community members face. We help combat these through our website verification process. Our team collects lists of known reputable projects and known scams, then displays the website’s “trust status” when a user visits it. For trusted websites, we display a transaction on the blockchain signed by our or the project’s dev team verifying that the URL being visited is the one associated with the official project’s smart contract.\n\nTutorials\nHolding crypto is only half of the fun. Many new users aren’t aware that dApps and other projects on Solana exist, much less know how to use them. We want to change that. hulio offers in-browser interactive tutorials for some of the biggest projects on Solana, walking users through how to use each application step by step. During the tutorial, users are awarded Solana (and in the future native token for the project as well), providing incentive and the ability to interact with the blockchain without having to have owned crypto prior. We’re constantly adding tutorials, educating new users and helping early stage projects gain informed and engaged traction.\n\nDiscover\nSince we verify each web3 website a user visits, we can follow where Solana community traffic is being directed. This allows us to find the best new projects before anyone else. After a security check, we display these budding new projects on our “explore” page, exposing users to the newest frontier of the ecosystem."
