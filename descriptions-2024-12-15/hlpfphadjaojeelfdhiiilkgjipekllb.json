Just fire up the extension when you are reading a news article and you'll get detailed information, including a Content Quality Score, that will allow you to make a wise decision about sharing the article with your social media connection or your friends.\n\nAs you scroll, you see news articles from big-name outlets, and probably a few from blogs and forums that you are visiting regularly or not. What draws your attention the most? What news article will you linger over the longest? While many of these news posts are harmless, others could be damaging to you and your entire network. Misinformation is false or inaccurate information, whether it’s intentional or not. Often coming in the form of fake news articles, unintentionally misleading statuses, or satire content, this misinformation becomes dangerous when people act on it. What’s the big deal? If you share a fake news article, each of your social media connections is at risk for acting on false information.\n\nBRAVE Extension is delivered to you as part of a bigger project called DO ONE BRAVE THING (www.onebravething.eu), shortly DOBT. DOBT empowers youth to [1] recognise and challenge online polarising and radicalising propaganda and [2] develop on-/off-line campaigning, counter-narratives and democratic civic engagement to promote EU values. It is fundamentally about empowering youth to challenge polarisation and propaganda challenging European values and empowering them as active agents shaping the future of Europe. DOBT is designed for short, medium and long-term impact and to be a model creating tools which can be scaled EU-wide.\n\nThis project is funded by the European Union’s Internal Security Fund — Police.Grant agreement No: 812631."
