Every request and calculation are a small amounts of electricity consumed and we visit billions of pages and websites needing to run millions of servers or devices like telephones always more powerful and ever more obsolete.\n\nSome optimisations are made for videos or images, if possible quality is set to low-definition.\nSome \"superfluous\" content can also be blocked like share and like button, avatar images or fonts.\n\nBut do not forget, the reduction of Internet browsing must be done, but it will never have as much impact as the reduction of Internet manufacturing (and devices that connect to it). So keep your computers, phones... as long as possible, repair them or do not buy them!"
