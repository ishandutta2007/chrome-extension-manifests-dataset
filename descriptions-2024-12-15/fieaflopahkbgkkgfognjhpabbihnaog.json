Looking Glass adapts content to your proficiency level, helping you learn naturally through media you love.\n\nüéØ Why Choose Looking Glass?\n\nImagine watching your favorite shows and movies in a foreign language, but with just the right amount of help to understand everything naturally. No more pausing to look up words, no more missing key plot points, and no more settling for beginner-level content when you're ready for more. Looking Glass sits quietly in your browser, intelligently adapting foreign language videos to match your current language level.\n\nFor language learners, finding truly comprehensible input that's also engaging is a constant challenge. Most comprehensible input available today is specifically curated content, which means you're often choosing between comprehensibility and genuine interest. What if you could turn any video into comprehensible input, automatically tuned to your level?\n\nLooking Glass makes this possible. Using a custom NLP pipeline, it identifies words at your 'N+1' level‚Äîjust beyond your current vocabulary‚Äîand selectively translates them. Combined with AI-powered graded reader versions of dialogues and summaries, Looking Glass transforms any video content into a personalized comprehensible input stream. Whether you're watching movies, TV shows, or online content, you can finally focus on content you love without sacrificing comprehensibility.\n\nNOTE: this product is in beta, please be patient with us!
