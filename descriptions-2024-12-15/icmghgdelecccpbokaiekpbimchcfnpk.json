For example, a grabbed collection of 500 photo links may be less than 1% the size of a just one photo.\n\n\n----------------------------\n\nThis extension is NOT associated with Instagram\n\nBy using this Extension you agree to the Terms and Conditions listed below:\n\nhttps://codeniklabs.com/projects/instagrab/terms.html"
