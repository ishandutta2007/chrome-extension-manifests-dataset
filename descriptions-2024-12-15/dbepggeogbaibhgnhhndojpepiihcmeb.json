Sorry about that!\n\n*NOTE* Chrome has some alarmist messaging around the permissions that Vimium needs to run. Really all it's asking for is that Vimium's javascript be loaded into every page. Don't be alarmed. Vimium never talks to any servers and does absolutely nothing with your data. Read the open source code if you're curious.\n\nFor more information about rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium's features, see here: https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/README.md\n\nModifier keys are specified as <c-x>, <m-x>, <a-x> for ctrl+x, meta+x, and alt+x respectively.\n\nNavigating the current page:\n\n    ?       show the help dialog for a list of all available keys\n    h       scroll left\n    j       scroll down\n    k       scroll up\n    l       scroll right\n    gg      scroll to top of the page\n    G       scroll to bottom of the page\n    d       scroll down half a page\n    u       scroll up half a page\n    f       open a link in the current tab\n    F       open a link in a new tab\n    r       reload\n    gs      view source\n    i       enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit esc to exit\n    yy      copy the current url to the clipboard\n    yf      copy a link url to the clipboard\n    gf      cycle forward to the next frame\n\nNavigating to new pages:\n\n    o       Open URL, bookmark, or history entry\n    O       Open URL, bookmark, history entry in a new tab\n    b       Open bookmark\n    B       Open bookmark in a new tab\n\nUsing find:\n\n    /       enter find mode -- type your search query and hit enter to search or esc to cancel\n    n       cycle forward to the next find match\n    N       cycle backward to the previous find match\n\nNavigating your history:\n\n    H       go back in history\n    L       go forward in history\n\nManipulating tabs:\n\n    J, gT      go one tab left\n    K, gt      go one tab right\n    g0         go to the first tab\n    g$         go to the last tab\n    t          create tab\n    x          close current tab\n    X          restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'x' command)\n    T          search through your open tabs\n\nAdditional advanced browsing commands:\n\n    ]]      Follow the link labeled 'next' or '>'.
