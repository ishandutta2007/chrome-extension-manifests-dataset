Pick multiple trade placement conditions and order them as you please. The trade will be executed after all the conditions have been fulfilled in your desired order. ) \n\n--------------------------\n\nThe app has four main sections:\n    - New Trade ( trade creation )\n    - Trades List ( trade listing with completion status )\n    - New Strategy ( strategy creation, bundling up trades )\n    - Strategies List ( strategies list with completion status )\n\nSecondary sections: \n    - Readme ( general extension workflow in detail )\n    - Contribute ( donation addresses )\n\n >> If nothing happens when you try to open a section from the extension menu, please refresh the exchange page (website) <<\n\nTo place an automated trade you will have to do the following:\n\n1) Select your trade targets: \n    - current price ticker \n    - price input \n    - amount input and action button (buy/sell)\n\n2) Input your trade details: \n    - trade label (to be shown in the list)\n    - trade price\n    - trade amount\n    - trade placement condition\n\n3) Confirm the trade details\n\n4) Keep the exchange page/tab open until the trade is placed or you don't want to place the trade at that time.
