This is not an ad blocker; it just automates the process of clicking on the \"Skip Ad\" button on YouTube.\n\nThis is basically useful when you are watching a YouTube video (or a playlist), and an ad starts playing. YouTube allows you to skip the ad after 5 seconds, but if you can't be bothered to click it yourself (or you are AFK), this extension clicks that button for you.\n\nConfigurations can be set per channel. Did you know: YouTubers are paid 50% of the revenue for any ads playing on their videos. You can use this extension to play ads longer (or not skip) for channels you want to support, or skip them entirely for some.\n\n=====================================\n‣ Version 2.2.0 fixes the extension breaking from recent Youtube UI update.\n\n=====================================\n‣ Version 2.1.0 fixes the extension breaking from recent Youtube update.\n\n=====================================\n‣ Version 2.0.2 fixes the extension breaking for some users due to recent update to YouTube.\n\n========= New in version 2.0 =============\n\n‣ Ability to stop countdown to skip ad.\n\nSome ads just grip you and you want to watch it till the end. Now you'll see a countdown before the ad is skipped and a button to end the countdown.\n\n========= New in version 1.0 =============\n\nAd Skipper now has so much more to offer:\n\n‣ You can now set how long to play the ad before skipping (as fast as 0 seconds).\n‣ Mute ads automatically\n\nUnlock these features with a support of just 3 cups of coffee a year (USD $7/yr).\nThe original core feature is and will always remain FREE!"
