In both cases, you need to be granted to see such results, with valid AT Internet credentials. Charts make available their data for copy, with the Data Query URL used to retrieve them).\t\n• Tags can be displayed with three levels of detail: summary, detailed, advanced.\t\t\n• Copy in clipboard: one, filtered or all. Each tag is copied with complete tag URL, page URL and Data Query URL (tabulated text format, Excel compliant).\n\nTo know more, please see the Online guide."
