Well this simple Chrome extension will fix that in the most bare bone basic way, this extension will press the loop button for infinity, making sure you're YouTube Playlist is always looped.* Come with easy to disable and enable button!\n\nThis is my 1st extension, trying to learn and better my coding, I'm sure there is something that will break, if anyone want to take my idea and make it better, go for it!\n\n\n*InfinLooper loops playslist by coding it so the extension presses the loop button over and over again, which means it goes from (Off) to (Loop Playlist) to (Loop Video) back to (Off) and so on and so on, SO there is a chance that the last video in your playlist ends while the extension has the loop button on (Off) while it's trying to get it to (Loop Playlist) and that might cause the playlist not to loop"
