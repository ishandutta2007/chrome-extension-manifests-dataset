This is a workaround for that using tags. These do not replace the regular whole-star ratings, they are used in addition via the tag shelves.\n\n\nInfo:\n* The rating scale is from 0 to 5 with increments of 0.25\n\n* The tag name format is as \"rating-TYPE-RATING\" where TYPE is \"stars\" or \"clouds\" and RATING is \"0-0\" through \"5-0\"\n\n* Various other tag rating formats are support for convenience (\"4-half-stars\", \"four-and-one-half\", etc)\n\n* Hyphens are used instead of decimal places for half-star/cloud ratings since the period character (\".\") is not allowed in tags\n\n* Rating images are intentionally not displayed in the add-tag popup area so that it is easier to see auto-complete their text names\n\n\nExamples:\n* For a 3.5 star rating, use a tag named \"stars-3-5\"\n* For a 5.0 cloud rating, use a tag named \"clouds-5-0\"\n* Or, you can prefix labels to the rating, such as \"goodness-stars-3-5\" or \"badness-stars-3-5\", etc"
