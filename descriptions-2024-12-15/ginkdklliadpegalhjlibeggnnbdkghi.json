With Clozoom, your Zoom attendee tabs automatically close 10 seconds after you open them, unless you cancel.\n\nIf you have different needs or Internet speeds, you can adjust that 10 second delay up or down.\n\n--- * ---\n\nThe real story behind Clozoom...\n\nSCENE.\n\nSkype. Facetime. WebEx. Hangouts.\n\nLong ago, these four video chat apps lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when Zoom was born. Zoom wrecked havoc on all of our browser tabs as it slowly proliferated all human interaction on Earth and never cleaned up after itself. Only Clozoom, the master of Zoom attendee tabs, could stop it, but when the world needed it most, it never came.\n\nMany moons passed and I built Clozoom, a tab-bending Chrome extention. Although its tab-bending skills are great, it has a lot to learn before it's ready to save anyone.\n\nBut I believe Clozoom can save the world.\n\nCUE MUSIC."
