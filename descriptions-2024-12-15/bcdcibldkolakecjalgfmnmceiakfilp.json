Each time you sign into a site, the password generator is used to generate the password for your account. This involves the following steps:\n\n1) On the sign in form of the site you enter your user name\n2) When you navigate to the password field, the MindYourPass password generator opens a dedicated tab\n3) If you haven't already done so, you sign into MindYourPass with your email address and your \"master\" password for MindYourPass\n4) Then, on the main screen of MindYourPass, you enter your single \"easy-to-remember\" password and press Enter. This will instruct the generator to generate a password for you\n5) MindYourPass autofills the generated password in the password field of the sign in form of the site\n6) The user presses enter to sign into his account\n\nIn order to start using an on-the-fly password on one of your existing accounts, you have to reset the corresponding password once and replace it with an on-the-fly generated password."
