Selling yours or actively looking for a new house? House Reviews let’s the community review and share feedback about a house. \n\nEver wonder about the neighborhood? Or if that the bedroom is really a closet? Or if the price is high or low for the area? Don’t miss out on valuable content from users who have seen the house or know the area. Maybe that house doesn’t really have a view or it could be the gem of the area! \n\nHouse Reviews let’s users give real time feedback on a house listing. \n\nDoesn’t it seem like some sites' estimates are way off? Or too generic leaving you saying- “that doesn’t seem right”? All of the algorithmic estimators use market data without really looking at a home; mostly just ave sq ft price. Our Social Estimate feature let’s users input his or her opinion of the market price which is often more valuable than a data driven price. \n\nOur goal is to socialize real information from real users into the housing market.
