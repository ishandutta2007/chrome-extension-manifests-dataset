Allow customers to see items on a second monitor as you ring them up . This is for Lightspeed Retail-X users running the Sell screen on PC/Mac. \n\nFor other features to modify the Back Office features of Lightspeed Retail-X, check out our other extension, Vextend Office by searching in the Chrome Web Store.\n\n\n\nVextend Display is the new version of Vextend Sell. I had announced in 2022 that I would no longer support Vextend Sell after Google forced extensions to update to a new version code that runs extensions. However, I have decided to offer Vextend Display as a replacement as Lightspeed did not appear willing to provide a customer facing display for Desktop users on Lightspeed POS (Retail-X).\n\nFind more information about the change and new extension at our website, www.vextend.com.\n\nChange Summary\n- All features EXCEPT the customer facing display have been removed from this version of the extension. Many were broken, and due to how they functioned, they were susceptible to breaking with any minor changes from Lightspeed. The customer facing display was/is the only feature that connected specifically to messages emitted by Lightspeed for the purpose of an extension, so we feel good that this will remain compatible as long as Lightspeed continues to offer these messages.\n- The color scheme of the extension icon has changed to a golden yellow to reflect the new extension. \n- This extension is no longer free. After a free 30 day trial, a message is shown on the customer display. The yearly subscription is $50/year USD for all registers using a single Lightspeed store domain (outlet). While the message will not require payment to continue to use, it would deter from the purpose of a customer facing screen. Learn more about why there is now a fee and how to get a free trial/subscribe at our website. We understand no business owner wants additional costs, but after reading our End of Life message we hope you can be polite and understand our reasoning (the alternative was we discontinue the software).\n\nSignup at Vextend.com.\n\nI hope this extension can still serve your business's needs. It's been a bigger undertaking than planned to get this up and running, but I hope it can help small business owners like myself."
