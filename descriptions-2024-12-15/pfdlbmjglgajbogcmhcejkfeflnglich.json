Yeah, me too, and unfortunately, it's hopeless. BUT, you can make your registration experience a bit more manageable with GT ORE!\n\nGT ORE adds the following features to Oscar to make your registration experience more user friendly:\n\n1- Adds a \"cart\"-like feature that allows you to add your desired courses to the cart, either by adding the CRN manually, or by clicking the \"Add to Cart\" button next to the course while looking up classes. You can then fill your CRNs all at once by clicking the \"Fill CRNs\" button on the add/drop page. It is basically a substitute to copying/pasting CRNs.\n\n2-Integrates Course Critique data right into Oscar. Allows you to view each professor's average GPA and grade distribution without having to leave Oscar.\n\nPlanned Features:\n-Custom Oscar Themes\n-Improvements to cart UI\n-Better manual CRNs validation\n\n1.0.3:\n-Now works with the new Banner software update\n-Makes the lookup Subject box bigger\n\n1.0.2:\n-Fixes: \"Fill CRNs\" button shows up on random pages.\n-Integrates the new course critique API"
