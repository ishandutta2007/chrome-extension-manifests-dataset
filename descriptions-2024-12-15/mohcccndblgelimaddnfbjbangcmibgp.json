This extension was made to help all the users participating in numerous meetings, classes, and events happening over Google Meet.\n\nNew update changes:\n1. Bug fixes: Works as intended on Mac, Fixes the flow to mute the media before auto join.\n2. Quick launch meeting on clicking the extension.\n3. Update Notification\n\nFeatures added:\n\n1. Set the default Google Account:\nWhen you have multiple Google accounts and you join a meet link to realize that it's not linked to the correct Google account, you have to switch the accounts to join with the right one manually. Instead, set the Google Account Number (https://imgur.com/a/58dSAWS) - usually as 0, 1, 2, to auto-redirect to the correct Google Account.\n\n2. Auto Join:\nBypass the intermediary screen and directly join the meeting.\n\n3. Auto Mute Audio and Video:\nNo need to manually mute audio and video for every meeting. It's done automatically for you.\n\n4. Push to Talk:\nYou can unmute and speak by enabling the push to talk feature. We now support Space and Left Shift keys. Just press and hold the key to speak, and when done, release the key. Its that simple. If you need to mute/unmute, simply tap the key.\n\n5. Auto Enable Captions:\nCaptions are turned on by default when you enter the meeting.\n\n6. Copy URL button:\nIt's a tedious process to share just the meeting URL with another person. We have a quick solution for that.\n\n7. Quit the meeting using keys:\nJust press 'Ctrl' + 'Q' to quit any meeting directly. No more awkwardly searching for the \"End Call\" button.\n\n8. Quick launch meeting:\nJust click on the extension and launch a meeting. The URL is immediately copied into clipboard, so that you can share it with others.\n\n9. Update check:\nWhenever the extension updates, the icon changes automatically, suggesting you to update to the new version.\n\nCheck the options page to enable or disable these features depending on your requirements.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nWe don't store your data. Period.  \n\nAcknowledgments:\nSourabh Jain [https://github.com/sourabh10995] for helping me out with the development of this extension.\nMithun Mohan [https://dribbble.com/mthnmhn] for the designs and icons.\n\nIf anyone wants to contribute to the project, please do let me know.\n\nUpcoming features:\n\n1. Ability to select the Google account (Including your profile details instead of the numbers)\n2. Raise the Hands feature\n3. More keys for Push To Talk\n4. Record Meeting to the main screen.\n5.
