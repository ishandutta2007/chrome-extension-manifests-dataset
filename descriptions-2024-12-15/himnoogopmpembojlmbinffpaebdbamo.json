Supports Archives of Nethys (https://aonsrd.com/) and Starjammer SRD (https://www.starjammersrd.com/).\n\nFeet are converted into both metres and generic “units”, which are equivalent to squares. For example, a distance of 30 feet is shown as both 9.1 m, so that people with a metric background can understand it, and as 6U, so that you can easily measure it on a game mat.\n\nThe original, imperial units are displayed as a tooltip for each conversion. However, if there are many conversions on a page, the current process to add tooltips can delay the page load. To prevent this, tooltips are limited to the first 20 conversions by default. You can change this in the advanced settings.\n\nI have no affiliation with or endorsement from the sites mentioned.
