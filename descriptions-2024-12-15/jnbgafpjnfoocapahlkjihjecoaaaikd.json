It has three primary features:\n1. Filtering RDR2 streams to only show WildRP activity\n2. Automatically tagging/customizing streams based on:\n     a. the active character being played.\n     b. the faction (if any) that the character belongs to.\n3. Searching for specific characters or factions.\n\nEverything is automatic, you don't have to do anything.\n\nThis is a modified fork of Vaeb's Twitch NoPixel Only extension, which I could not live without when watching Wild. Much thanks for Vaeb for the major assist.\n\n--- FAQ ---\n\n> \"Does this only apply to the RDR2 category on Twitch?\"\nYes. This extension will only affect the RDR2 page linked above. Other Twitch pages will not be affected.\n\n> \"How does the tagging work?\"\nEach channel's title will be compared against their character data to best identify the active character. This includes checking the title for nicknames, partial-names, and faction names. The stream is then tagged with the character name, and the tag is colored based on the character's faction (if one exists). The large majority of Wild streamers put character indications in their title. However, even if they don't, it will tag the stream with a best-guess (based on who they usually play) surrounded by question-marks, e.g. \"? Antonio ?\".\n\n> \"How do you know if it's a WildRP stream?\"\nFirstly, this extension contains a large list of streamers on the server (currently 406) who are included by default. This list is updated frequently and fetched during runtime (list changes do not require updating the extension). If they're not in the list (new to the server) then the stream title will be checked for terms such as \"WildRP\", \"Wild RP\" etc. I've never had an issue with it missing a stream. There is also an option to include other RP servers such as SundownRP and NewCenturyRP. However, there is no individual tagging/customizing done for these servers; all of them are colored pale-blue.\n\n> \"What happens if it's a new streamer, with nothing known about their character?\"\nEven if they aren't in the vast—and growing—list of streamers, they will still be included as long as there is some remote indication of Wild in their title. If no info is known about their character but their title contains some indication of a faction, then the stream will be tagged generically based on that faction, e.g. \"< Kettleman Gang >\". If no info is known about their character nor is there any faction indication, they will be included with just the generic tag \"WRP\". Once they appear in the known streamer list, the tag will change to their current character's name and faction color.\n\nTip: Keeping the \"Force English only\" setting enabled will improve performance when scrolling into the lower-viewcount streams.\n\nIf you have any questions, issues, or to propose character changes, suggest feedback on https://twrponly.tv."
