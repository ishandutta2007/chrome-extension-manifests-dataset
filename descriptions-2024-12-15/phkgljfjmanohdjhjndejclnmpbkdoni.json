The Silver Standard extension is a tool that converts prices displayed on web pages from dollars to ounces of silver. A hover over the price reveals its original price in dollars. This extension uses the API key from Open Exchange Rates and requests the exchange rate with USD as the base currency. The extension runs on most pages and runs at the end of the page loading process. Conversion to ounces may not work right on all pages prices. Conversion ability is subject to API limits and may not be available at all times.  Exchange rate is updated once every hour."
