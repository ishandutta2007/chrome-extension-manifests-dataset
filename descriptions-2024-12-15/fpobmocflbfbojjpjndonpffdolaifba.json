The MFC Shopper extension streamlines this process, and lets you search for a figure directly from its MFC page, while still giving you complete control over your query!\n\nNot only does it automatically provide figure data as keywords to add to your search query, it makes it trivial to edit queries in Japanese without any knowledge of the language. Simply click to add a keyword, and the Japanese version will be added to the query. Furthermore, a translated version of your query is always available, and simply clicking a translated term will remove it from your search."
