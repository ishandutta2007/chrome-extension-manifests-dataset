For example, if you have looked at 5 t-shirts on Amazon and added 2 of them to cart and finally bought one, you can publish this journey like a game in 1-click. Users who are looking for t-shirt shopping tips can guess which t-shirt you bought and score points. It is a fun way to share your shopping tips and gain followers!"
