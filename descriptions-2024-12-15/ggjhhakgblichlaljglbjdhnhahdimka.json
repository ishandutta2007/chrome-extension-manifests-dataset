Don't rely on the price guides provided by agents anymore.\n\nWhat is Pretium?\n\nAn extension running on domain.com.au and realestate.com.au that provides aggregate property value estimations from trusted sources. Pretium does not conduct value estimations itself but rather directs users to established providers.\n\nWhy Pretium?\n\nPretium was born out of my frustration with the Sydney housing market. Agents are not obliged to provide a price guide on a listing and even when they do, the number is often wildly innacurate. But searching every address I was interested in value estimators is tiresome. I hope Pretium can form part of the solution by providing property value estimations along side listings.\n\nContact?\n\nThis extension is in it's early stages of development. Please report any bugs or issues to contact@pretium.tech. The more information, the better! Likewise if you have any suggestions for new features.\n\nLike what I do?\n\nConsider leaving a 5 star review of Pretium!"
