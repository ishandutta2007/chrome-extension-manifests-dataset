CORS, HTTPS, WSS, AUTH.... \n\nSo, I made a simple chrome extension. \n\nIt will:  \n- work while you're logged into the camera's embedded web server. (192.168.xxx.xxx)\n- protect your privacy - won't ask for your credentials \n- make the video full screen\n- enables PTZ control via keyboard (<-- this is awesome)\n- centers camera position where ever you click\n\nLots of additional functionality coming:\n- Play h265 video directly from the device (<CAMERA_IP>/sd)\n- SET/CALL commands\n- Command macros, so you don't need to remember all the weird codes\n- On screen PTZ controls, semi-transparent overlay\n\nAlso, if you just want a simple interface w/o this extension, try visiting your camera at <CAMERA_IP>/mobile.html\n\n*PLEASE DON'T LEAVE BAD RATINGS. I'm offering this for free. \nIf it doesn't work for you, send me an email and maybe I can help you out.\nOr just uninstall it and have a nice day!\n\nchrismclcd@gmail.com"
