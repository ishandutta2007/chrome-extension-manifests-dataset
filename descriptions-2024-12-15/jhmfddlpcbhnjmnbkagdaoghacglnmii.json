For non-Teochew usage info (like useful keyboard shortcuts), please refer to his page or the in-extension help. If Teochew functionality isn't needed at all, please directly use Zhongwen for Mandarin learning instead.\n\nPress the [潮] button to enable the extension and bring up the mini-help menu. Move the mouse outside the help menu to clear it or hit the [Esc] keyboard button. Mouse over Chinese to bring up the entry in a pop-up.\n\nFor most users, you'll get the most mileage looking up a word in English on a translation website and then mousing over the Chinese characters.\n\n-Layout-\n\nEach entry shows Simplified Chinese and then Traditional Chinese, if the characters are different, and then the Pinyin and Teochew Romanization with the definition underneath. The layout, including omitting Pinyin, can be customized on the options page.\n\nIn many cases, a single Chinese character will have many Teochew pronunciations and the correct one for a multi-character word cannot be determined by software. In that scenario, the possible pronunciations are listed together. In order to help with the clutter that may cause, the Teochew pronunciations that belong to a character will be grouped by color. For example, in a three Chinese character word, all pronunciations associated with the first character will be red, with the second character green, and with the third blue.\n\nAs it turns out, Teochew can differ from one location to the next where the amount of differences correlate strongly with geographical barriers. The Teochew in this extension is based on the prestige form found in the city center of Shantou and most widely reflects the Teochew spoken worldwide.\n\n-Teochew Romanization: Peng'im-\n\nGiven that most users aren't familiar with Peng'im, almost every Teochew syllable also has a playable pronunciation. \n\n-Play All Feature-\n\nTo facilitate learning the tone changes, a Play All button when clicked will play the audio for all characters with the tone changes. When a Chinese character has multiple pronunciations, the first pronunciation or a pronunciation marked with 训 or 俗 will be used.\n\nGOAL OF CHROME EXTENSION\n\nThis extension intends to supplement those who already have a Teochew or Chinese background to expand and reinforce their vocabulary when talking with family or if they're studying Mandarin to leverage familiarity from already speaking Teochew. Confirm the correct Teochew pronunciation by asking a family member. My hope is that your Teochew and communication with family will both improve!\n\nUPDATE\n[v. 2.4.0]\n- Migrate to Chromium Manifest V3\n\n[v. 2.3.0]\n- Additional enhancements\n\n[v. 2.1.0]\n- Network enhancements\n\n[v. 2.0.0]\n - Extension download size reduced by 60%\n - \"Play all\" bug fixed when final character in a word does not have audio\n\n[v. 1.1.0]\n - Pop-up implemented using Shadow DOM to isolate the play buttons from the web page CSS\n - Dictionary updated with more Standard Chinese words"
