When you have a browser compatible with Chrome extensions open, click on the AstroGlyph icon from your extensions menu and a popup appears with astrological symbols and glyphs on it.\n2. When you press a symbol on the popup, it gets automatically copied to your clipboard.\n3. Paste the symbol wherever you need it using Ctrl+V, or Command+V, or right-click>Paste, or Edit>Paste, or however else you like to paste.\n \nWhy do I need this?\n\n1. Write more clearly and concisely\n\nAstrological jargon is often awkward and character-intensive. Why write \"Sun in Libra opposite Jupiter retrograde in Aries\" when you could just type \"☉♎︎☍♃℞♈︎\" with AstroGlyph?\n\n2. Save yourself the time and frustration\n\nFinding and copying and pasting astrological symbols online is a bit of a chore. Give yourself a break by having AstroGlyph at the ready.\n\nAre there any special features?\n\nYes! Press the checkbox at the bottom of the popup to \"Open in a new window\". This will open a new tab with the popup in it so you don't have to keep re-opening the extension to copy a symbol."
