When you copy text from Chat GPT, it often includes a background color that can be distracting and make it difficult to read or use in other applications. This extension removes the background color from the copied text, allowing for a cleaner and more usable result.\n\nTired of pesky background colors getting in the way when you copy and paste text? Worry no more! Our handy extension is here to help. Here's how you can get started:\n\n🌐 Visit chat.openai.com: Head over to chat.openai.com where the magic happens.\n\n🔄 Refresh the Page: If you're already on the page, give it a quick refresh to make sure our extension is ready to roll.\n\n📋 Copy Text: Simply highlight the text you want to copy as you normally would. Don't worry about any background colors; we'll take care of them!\n\n🖱️ Right Click & Copy: Right-click on the selected text and choose \"Copy\" from the context menu (or use Ctrl + C).\n\n📄 Paste Anywhere: Paste the text wherever you like (with Ctrl + V), and voilà! The background color is gone, but the rest of the formatting stays intact.\n\n❤️ Show Some Love: Enjoying the extension? You can support us through KoFi and follow us on Twitter for updates!\n\n📝 Note: Text copied from code blocks (like <pre> or <code> elements) won't be affected by the extension. We know code is special! 😉\n\n🎈 Happy Copying & Pasting! 🎈"
