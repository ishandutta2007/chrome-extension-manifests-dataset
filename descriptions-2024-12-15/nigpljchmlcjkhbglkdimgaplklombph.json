Intercepts Content Security, X-Sniff, X-Frame, and more to keep 'them' from policing 'you'. It's your browser again. \n\nThis author has been producing the leading extensions for I-Framing and related hacks since 2004, and circulated to over 10 Million+ users, and hit the top 10,000 on Alexa. The Assassin is a hobby project made for personal use only but shared with you because you deserve to use the Internet as you please. \n\nmillions on millions of sites will now work in ways they did not. Got a warning that says you are not allowed to access a site because of a security policy? If frames are not allowed, well the Assassin can likely solve your problem. Don't let it interrupt your experience.\n\n It works silently and will never add more advertising banners, boxes or ask for donations or anything, ever.\n\n Its codebase is included in other products that wildly vary but if you haven't got it or just think you still need, the assassin will oblige. ;) It's OneWorldLicense/No-Troll License Free Sharing.\n\nFREE from X-Ray Extensions,\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nThis is an X-Frame cross origin scripting hack to re-enable web functionality to include the users ability to stream and run content through iframes to and from Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Youtube, Github, Mediawiki's, the list is endless. Please note that per the presidential and Google's decree and the involvement of Homeland Security in observing plugins, and potential vulnerabilities it goes without saying this is a hot topic, with national security implications. If you are involved with a terror plot, you are an asshole and may not use this plugin. See the verbiage on oneworldlicense.com to learn more about what you can't do and how you repulse me. Otherwise just please don't blame me if it stops working. And yes its harmless, if you don't know what I'm talking about fear not. Hard to keep up with changes, It's my 4th in two years. I've a financial interest in making sure I can always get past this little bump, and as a courtesy I'm giving one such method to you all as frankly I like the web the way t was without so many rules. Maybe you did too. Don't forget to say hi! \n\n\nThe Assassin knows no rules, has no regard for the opinions of one website over another. He is cold, calculating and completely devoid of remorse or bias. He does not like when websites say you cannot do something and if he can prevent you from being in that situation he will. Like his ancient ancestors he values silence, and discretion, and expediency. He will if capable kill the problem header before you know there was a problem, and he will not alert you that he has done so. He needs no thanks, and is desirous of no recognition, and will always abide. Just glance at him every now and then with a look that says you respect his role, and that is more than enough to oblige him. Though on occasion he does enjoy a Sioux City Sasparella, it's a good'n.\n\nx-ray extensions\nhttp:/rayanthony.io/extensions/\n@rayanthonyrcc"
