Fractional Settings were using more GPU and causing other issues on my OS (using Linux).\n\nI started zooming the windows I have on a specific screen. It was effecting other windows & tabs and adjusting this tab per tab was just wasting time.\n\nI decided to create an extension where I can just set a zoom settings for a specific window and all the tabs within that window would be zoomed accordingly.\n\n* If you move a tab from zoomed window, it will reset itself back to 100% zoom.\n* If you add a tab from another, non-zoomed window to zoomed window, it will zoom automatically.\n* Zoomed window & its tabs are not per-origin. Meaning if you visit the same site on another window, it will have your default zoom settings (usually 100% / no - zoom)."
