This means an outage. You should always load these asynchronously.\n\nSites do go down. Even big ones. Or they fail to load for other reasons (e.g. corporate firewall blocking). You don't want your site to go down when a third party goes down.\n\n// You want:\nyour outage = your outage\n\n// as opposed to\nyou outage += Google outage + FB outage + Twitter outage + LinkedIn + .....\n\nThis extension helps you visualize the negative effects by redirecting recognized third party JavaScripts to a blackhole (http://blackhole.webpagetest.org).\n\nThe list of recognizes script include:\n\n*://ajax.googleapis.com/*\n*://apis.google.com/*\n*://*.google-analytics.com/*\n*://connect.facebook.net/*\n*://platform.twitter.com/*\n*://code.jquery.com/*\n*://platform.linkedin.com/*\n*://*.disqus.com/*\n\nThe extension stays dormant until you click the # icon. Then the extension starts listening to requests and blackholes the recognized ones. It shows a badge in the icon with how many scripts were blackholed and on mouseover shows you the URLs.\n\nRegarding the name... 3PO = 3rd Party Optimization. And #fail is kinda obvious."
