Having access to all the kit icons for the 2022/23 season, I decided to display an away kit representing a player, when their next fixture (in the \"Pick Team\"/\"My Team\" tab) is an away one.\n\nIf you'd like to support the project, you can donate to my paypal, using this link:\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/fplaway/1\n\nAny financial help would be very appreciated <3\n\nFind me on twitter @AwayFpl\n\nThe extension will be constantly updated if needed with the feature currently developed being double fixtures handling (ideally display as in the extension logo)."
