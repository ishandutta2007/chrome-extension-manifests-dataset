It lets you take notes while you're thinking. I find  app-switching distracting. I made this to record thoughts in the moment, and process and commit them to a heavier-duty notes app afterwards. \n\nIt's useful for:\n\n- Doing research across 5 different tabs. \n- Taking minutes on video calls\n- Reading industry reports and papers\n- Copying important parts of how-to's (like, getting HTTPS set up for your domain)\n\nSome useful features: \n- A quick-copy shortcut to paste highlighted text directly in your editor. Works with pdfs too.\n- Each note keeps a bibliography so you can refer to your sources later.\n- You can tag, stash, and retrieve notes. \n- It integrates with Google Drive and Notion, so you can export your notes after you're done. \n\n* Toggle it with the \"Open Jotter\" keyboard shortcut, which defaults to \"Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Space\". \n\nIf you've found a bug, or have suggestions, ping me: (itsdavebot@gmail.com)."
