Or wish you could get more gifts or followers? \n\nIf these questions sound like you - we're excited to introduce you to Chat Capture! \n\nOpen Chat Capture on your TikTok live URL in the browser and collect comments from your chat. Then open Chat Capture at the URL www.runchatcapture.com/play/flashcards.html and your chat's comments will be automatically entered into the game when you click \"Start Game\".\n\nFlashcard Automation Features: \n\n- Automatic flashcard display and navigation\n- Viewer profile picture and username display\n\nThings To Remember: (Visit https://www.runchatcapture.com/cc/getting-started for more details on these)\n\n- Whether hosting via TikTok Live Studio or by pointing your phone at your computer, TikTok sends captchas to check if you are present at your device.

They usually occur after 1 or 4 hours of going live and 4 hours after you solve a captcha.\n- Log into TikTok on your laptop before scraping comments from your live session URL. An example of a live session URL is: https://www.tiktok.com/@yourcoder/live.\n- The browser window for scraping comments must be at least partially visible on your screen to keep it active and scraping.\n\nLinks you should check out:\n\n- Getting Started: https://www.runchatcapture.com/cc/getting-started\n- Privacy Policy: https://www.runchatcapture.com/cc/privacy-policy"
