Schoology also contains a number of text channels for communication between students and teachers. These posts and comments have a like button already, which allows users to provide positive feedback on those posts. However, noticeably absent is a button to provide negative feedback, or a dislike button. If a user wants to provide such feedback, their only recourse is to reply with a comment, which is in many cases subject to stigma and is not anonymous. This makes it very difficult, and uncommon, for users to provide any sort of constructive criticism.\n\nThis extension rectifies this issue by adding a dislike button to all posts and comments. It's anonymous, but still secure. The extension allows users a risk-free way to provide their constructive, negative feedback while preventing the hurtful speech necessarily found when users are forced to comment on posts instead of simply pressing the dislike button."
