For CrunchyRoll compatible extension, use Roll Together!\nI believe this should still work on wakanim.tv, so Wakanim users might still find use for it, but I've decided to start work on a CrossWatch 2, which I'm building and structuring from scratch to be compatible with the new Manifest v3, and to be a little easier to extend with crosswatch capabilities for different services.)\n\nCrossWatch is a watch party extension derived from the Roll Together extension. CrossWatch will work across both Funimation, Wakanim and CrunchyRoll. You set up a CrossWatch server ( https://github.com/praabjerg/crosswatch_backend ), and each participant sets the server link in the extension options. If you watch with a regular group, you can also set a default Room ID.\nWhen you activate the extension on any of the three streaming services, you can join a room, and everyone in that room will have their video streams synchronized, regardless of which of the three streaming services they use.\nThis extension aims to solve some of the issues with arranging watch parties across different regions with different licensing. Funimation and Wakanim in particular share many series because they are owned by the same company, but they are still different streaming services operating in different regions.\n\nKeep in mind:\n- This extension does not know or care *which* video you're watching, so participants have to navigate to the videos themselves, and you may even have to switch videos manually when reaching the end of an episode.\n- I do not at the moment run a public server for this extension. For now at least, your watch group needs to figure out where to run a server instance if you want to use it: https://github.com/praabjerg/crosswatch_backend\n\nIf you're doing just a CrunchyRoll watch party specifically, you should probably use the Roll Together extension instead, as it's going to be more specialised for CrunchyRoll. This extension aims at being adaptable to different services, and so it removes some code and functionality that Roll Together has.\n\nChanges version 1.0-1.1:\n- The extension now hooks into the brightcove player API when on Funimation, instead of using the HTML5 api directly. This should fix most of the issues with playback stopping when seeking backward."
