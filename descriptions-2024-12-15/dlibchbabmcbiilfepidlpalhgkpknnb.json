You will have to overcome all challenges to win. This is a game that combines all the best elements from the famous Fall Guys, becoming one of the best clones you can find on smartphones.\n\nThe colorful graphics in Stumble Guys will accompany you from the beginning in this video game version of Takeshi's Castle. Each round consists of three different challenges, in which a maximum number of players can participate. Your goal in each level is to avoid obstacles until you reach the finish line. This challenge is not easy but will always keep you entertained: you will face giant snowballs, falling platforms, revolving doors, bursting balls, and more.\n\nGameplay in Stumble Guys is simple, thanks to the included controller: a virtual joystick for movement and a jump button. Not only can you use this button to overcome obstacles, but you can also move forward with momentum if you press it a second time while in the air. The interesting part of this particular battle royale title is not just the gameplay; You will also have several avatars to choose from. You can unlock character skins with gold earned in the game.\n\nStumble Guys is a great multiplayer game, with an interesting physics system that brings the excitement of competing with other players to claim the coveted victory crown."
