Tabs that are being re-opened are thus not included.  You can use `Ctrl-Y` (`Ctrl-Shift-Y` on Windows) to open a new tab at the default location.\n\nNote for Chrome\n---------------\n\nKeyboard shortcuts are not automatically set up. You need to do that manually on the extension page in settings.\n\nNote for Firefox\n----------------\n\nTabs that are opened by clicking on links are opened at the default location.  You can change the setting `browser.tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent` in `about:config` if you want even those to be opened right next to the current. \n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nCaused by limitations of the webextension API, see\nhttps://github.com/sblask/webextension-open-tabs-next-to-current/issues/26\nand\nhttps://github.com/sblask/webextension-open-tabs-next-to-current/issues/29:\n\n - tabs are visibly moved to their final position\n - the tab bar is scrolled so the opened tab becomes the first visible one on\n   the left (Firefox only)\n - when opening multiple tabs at once, only one of them is opened at the right\n   position\n\n\nFeedback\n--------\n\nYou can report bugs or make feature requests on https://github.com/sblask/webextension-open-tabs-next-to-current\n\nPatches are welcome."
