The tasks on MTURK are called HITs, Human Intelligence Tasks, which this extension will try to grab for the user. This extension is not able to create an account, explain MTURK or give any support for MTURK.\n\nWebpage: (https://pandacrazymax.allbyjohn.com/)\nDocumentation: (https://github.com/JohnnyRS/PandaCrazy-Max/wiki)\n\nThe extension uses a timer which by default is set at 1 second to grab a panda link from the added jobs. Each job that is added from an external or internal button will be shown in the panda tabs area. If you want a job to start to collect you need to click on the collect button. Each job that is collecting will take turns being fetched by the extension using the timer value. So if you have 5 jobs collecting it will take about 5 seconds to try to grab any HITs from those 5 jobs. When the extension detects that a HIT was accepted it will sound an alarm and/or send a notification to the user. On the bottom the queue watch tab will show any accepted HITs in MTURK queue. Once you have HITs accepted you can go to the MTURK queue page and work on the HITs. This extension will not do your tasks for you.\n\nThe searchUI page which is called Search Crazy is where all search jobs will be placed. Any search jobs on this page are called search triggers. The extension will monitor the MTURK search page for any of these triggers you have set. You can have triggers look for a requester ID, group ID or a word in the title/description of a HIT. Once the script finds a HIT it will create or start a panda job on the pandaUI page according to options set for the trigger. Any HITs found from a custom trigger with a word or phrase in the title or description and price will sound an alarm and be shown on a tab where you can start collecting it. There is a way to auto collect some HITs too but with limits so your queue won't get filled up with HITs you don't have time to finish.\n\nThe extension does save stats and HITs history in a database on your computer for future use. You may also export all of your job and trigger data to a file so you can transfer it to another computer or have a backup for emergencies. The alarm sounds can all be changed to a mp3 sound you want if you don't like the default sounds."
