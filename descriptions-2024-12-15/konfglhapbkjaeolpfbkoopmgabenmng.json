Have a link you've been meaning to read but keep pushing off? Tired of having folders full of unread bookmarks? Then Page Forwarder is the extension you've been looking for!\n\nPage Forwarder actively blocks sites you want to avoid by redirecting you to pages you've been meaning to read. Simply create a black-list of sites and a list of articles/pages/videos you want to read, and Page Forwarder will do the rest! Instead of bookmarking and forgetting, use the quick-add apple on the right of your address bar to save your page for later viewing. \n\nI hope you find this tool useful!
