The header remains above the video, making it easier to know which episode you're watching without scrolling around.\n 2. The sidebar remains at the side of the page, providing all of the information on the side in an easy to use package.\n\nChangelog:\n\nUpdate 0.0.3 (1/10/2021):\n- Fixed bug with sidebar affecting users with adblock/who don't pay for crunchyroll premium.\n\nUpdate 0.0.2 (1/6/2021):\n- Fixed an issue where users who aren't logged in aren't getting theater mode goodness. (Forthcoming updates will address sidebar placement for anonymous users)\n\nOriginal Description --\n\nEver found the default video size on CrunchyRoll just too narrow? This extension increases the size of CrunchyRoll Videos, similarly to the size of YouTube' Theater Mode, allowing for a much better viewing experience!"
