We all love them. \nBut things can get really nasty when you have a lot of them!\n\nMonotab is the extension you need to get things done.\nForget multitasking and start monotasking in one tab. Just hit the black m in your extension bar, you will feel more productive already.\n\nMonotab prevents you from opening more than one tab in a window (seriously who uses multiple browser windows anymore?). It is great when you want to concentrate on one job and get it done.\n\nLinks that open new tabs start loading in the current tab â€” remember the last time you used that back button?\n\nAnd the pinned tabs don't count! You can always pin the tabs you are using for applications.\n(hit Alt+Shift+P for pinning)\n\nIf you ever want to return to the dark side of multitabs, click the red m."
