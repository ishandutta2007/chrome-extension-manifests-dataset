So I decided to solve this problem by creating an extension where bookmarks can update themselves if a certain condition is met. \n\nThis allows us to track:\n ‚úîÔ∏è anime / TV shows\n ‚úîÔ∏è videos in a YouTube playlist\n ‚úîÔ∏è last read blog / documentation page\n ‚úîÔ∏è etc. (basically ANYTHING with URL!)\n\nIt also comes with its bookmark manager which lets you easily filter tracked bookmarks, edit the regular expression, etc. \nYou can also view the history of the 10 most recent links for each dynamic (tracked) bookmark. \n\nTo stop tracking a bookmark, just remove the regular expression (RegExp) from it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nüéì What is \"regular expression\"?\n\nIt simply is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Ever did CTRL+F to find something on the page? Well, it's pretty much the same thing, but with extra special characters that let your search be more flexible.\n\nIn most cases, you won't even have to worry about the RegExp field since the automatically generated value will be good enough, but you might run into rare occasions where the site will be using unique URL notation which would require manual entry of this field.\n\nAn example of such a site is animekisa.tv. Let's see how we can generate regular expressions using a very simple tactic.\n\nFirst, let's click on few episodes:\nhttps://animekisa.tv/mo-dao-zu-shi-season-2-episode-3\nhttps://animekisa.tv/mo-dao-zu-shi-season-2-episode-4\n\nNow ask yourself, what part stays the same? - animekisa.tv/mo-dao-zu-shi-season-2\n\nAnd that would be our value for the RegExp field!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\nHopefully, by now you understood how to use this extension, but if that is not the case, a complete guide on how to use this extension with pictures and FAQ can be found here: https://github.com/DaniloNovakovic/chrome-dynamic-bookmarks/blob/master/README.md ü§î\n\nIf you have any additional ideas, requests, or if you encounter bugs, you can post an issue on GitHub page: https://github.com/DaniloNovakovic/chrome-dynamic-bookmarks/issues  üí°üêõ\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\nIf you enjoyed this extension you can support me by giving it 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
