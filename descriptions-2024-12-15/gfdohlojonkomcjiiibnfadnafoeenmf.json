Additionally, widgets allow you to quickly take notes or start a stopwatch all from just opening a new tab. Access to bookmarks, history, and notifications is also available. Given permission, baskets and notifications from external websites can be shown.\n\nThe style of the page can be thoroughly customised including background images and icons for each link. Backgrounds can be dynamically pulled and change every few hours, giving you a fresh landscape or city to look at. Alternatively, you can see featured images from Google Earth or NASA in the background.\n\nOnce you have a configuration, it can be exported to share with colleagues for them to import and use. This also allows you to backup your configuration.\n\nBased upon the work of Terrance on Homely, this extension takes the existing open source extension and extends it further. This extension is not affiliated with Homely, it only builds upon the existing open source foundation."
