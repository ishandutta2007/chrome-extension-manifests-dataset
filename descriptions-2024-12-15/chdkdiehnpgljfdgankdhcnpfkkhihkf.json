The API that supplied the data changed drastically without my knowledge. I have made the appropriate updates to get the data correctly again. I appreciate everyone that has stuck around, and I hope the score tracker will continue to be helpful and useful to you all!\n\nThe pop-up now includes an option to style the pop-up based around each team's colors! There's also the option to turn off these styles in case the colors don't work for you. Right click on the icon and deselect the 'Show team colors' option.\n\nI've received a lot of great feedback, and I'm always looking for more. Please, feel free to contact me with any issues or ideas you may have for this extension. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nThis extension adds an icon with your chosen NHL hockey team at the top of the browser that shows information about today's game in the icon's hover-text, real-time score and play information during games (including teams, period, scores, and shootout goals), and the appropriate win/loss flag when it's over!\n\nAfter you have selected your NHL hockey team with the icon. You'll be able to click on the icon to see a pop-up with information about your team, depending on the status of their game for the day (no game, before the game, during the game, and after the game).\n\nTo change the team you're viewing, right-click on the extension, and you will see the menu pop-up.\n\nThis extension is still under development. If there are any features you'd like to see or bugs that you come across when using this extension, please let me know by using the support hub on the extension's store page.\n\nCurrently on the list of functionality to be developed:\n- Power Play/Short Handed situation UI\n- Data on previous/future games from the calendar\n- And more...\n\nAll icons and team names are trademarks belonging to the National Hockey League or the respective teams, the owner of this application disclaims ownership of any trademarks, logos or images belonging to the National Hockey League or the respective team appearing on this site.
