There is a counter for the links too.\n\nThe analysis is done at two levels, one at top domain level and one at the one sub-directory level. This also lets you grab all the external links at once and also shows the internal links too. All the javascript links and the mailto links are avoided at the external links area but you can see them at the domain level and sub-domain level analysis of the page."
