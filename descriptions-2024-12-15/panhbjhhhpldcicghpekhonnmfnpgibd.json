It helps you make sure you have typed you password correctly.\n\nWhy should I install SHP? \n\nThere are many important reasons why you should install SHP: \n\n- You no longer have to type your passwords several times just because of one typing error. Just one click before submitting your form when you are not sure, is enough. This is also helpful to check if caps lock is active or you have currently selected another input language.\n\n- You no longer type wrong passwords when creating or registering for a new account. This saves your time and possibly avoids any headache.\n\n\nNew in v1.2:\n- Major bug that caused the extension to stop working is now fixed\n\nFor questions, reports, feedback, support or anything related to SHP contact us at hidev.chrome@gmail.com"
