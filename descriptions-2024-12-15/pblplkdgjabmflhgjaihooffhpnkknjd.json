Our app developers built this extension as a part of a Toronto based Hackathon. This extension is a browser based extension that takes care of browser related actions. There's absolutely no server side code that was used to create this extension and everything happens completely on the client side.\n\nWe take extreme pride in being one of the top level mobile app developer agency and this extension is just a sample of what we can build under seconds  \n\nOur Toronto app developers have open sourced this extension on our Github repo as a part of this hackathon and can be found on our Github repository. In case if you are planning to build something like this, feel free to reuse our code files and folder structures to build your extensions. \n\nAs far as the file and folder structure goes, we have the following: \n_locales\nCSS\nIcon pack\nJS files \nManifest.json \nAnd Source files \n\n\nInfo about _locales: This extension currently only supports English, but you can also add support to other languages here as well. Simply include your source files here and point them to the right place using your code and you would be good to go.\n\nCSS: Through this you can create your custom CSS code which can be directly added to your current website. After adding the code you will see the changes immediately.\nIcon Pack:  There is a list of free icons which can be used for extensions, app and theme. You can easily change the default icon with the ones you like.\nManifest.json: This file tells Chrome important information about the extension like the name and required permissions. You can directly put the JSON into manifest.json  \nSource Files:  While we have already written the extension using javascript, you add your own layer. If required you can create a separate bundle of your own source code files and merge them here with ours.\n \nAt last, we would like to thank all AppVelocity developers who participated in building this plugin at Toronto Hackathon. A great contribution to the open source society"
