Thanks everyone :)\n\nAn extension with a few small enhancements to CoinMarketCap.com which add a night theme, inline charts, volume-to-marketcap ratio column, auto-refresh timer, TradingView link, removes ads, and expands the main table to fill the entire window.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/NathanAB/cmc-enhanced"
