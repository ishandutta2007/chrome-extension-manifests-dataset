This extension is offered by a third party.\n\nYou can get the DraftKings Shark Finder here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draftkings-shark-finder-f/gfhfffikpfjhahmcbhilnooiecodhmcg\n\nThe \"FanDuel Shark Finder\" extension (for real RotoGrinders) will show you the best FanDuel fantasy sports contests to play in by quickly showing you how experienced all of the current contestants are...allowing you to quickly spot contests that have the least & most experienced players currently in each contest.  Now you can quickly find that perfect head-to-head, tournament or league to play in.  Just install the extension, visit the FanDuel game lobby and scroll within the game area and start seeing the games analyzed! \n\nIt quickly shows you any contest with \"newbies\" or \"less experienced\" players to play against so you can be sure you're playing against people of your relative skill level instead of being \"thrown in the shark pool\" to play against only professional players.\n\nYou can read below to get an idea of how it works...but the best way is to simply install it and start browsing through any of the fantasy football, basketball, baseball games on FanDuel and watch it magically color code them for you! (it works for any fantasy sport/game on FanDuel).\n\nThis extension automatically inserts a count of the number of \"leveal 1\", \"level 2\" & \"level 3\" players that are currently entered into a head-to-head contest and/or any contest that has a maximum number of contestants allowed of 10 or less.  The rating of the players is taken from how FanDuel ranks a player as laid out on their \"Experience Badge\" page.\n\nIf a head-to-head contest only has players available to play against that are level 3, then it is a \"red\" (most difficult) contest.  If there are players available to play against that are level 2, then it is a \"yellow\" (average difficulty) contest.  If there are players available to play against that are level 1, then it is a \"green\" (least difficult) contest.\n\nYou will see a total count displayed for head-to-head contests of level 3, level 2, level 1 players displayed next to the count of available contests when viewing the \"head-to-head\" lineup area.  You have to scroll to trigger the plugin to analyze each contest."
