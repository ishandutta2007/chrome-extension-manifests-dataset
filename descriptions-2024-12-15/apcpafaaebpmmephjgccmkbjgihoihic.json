This does mean that you will have some intermediate silence while the ads are playing, but this is not a large problem, at least for me personally.\n\nYou can find the source code here:\nhttps://github.com/KDJDEV/spotify-web-ads-muter\n\n————————————————————\nLEGAL\n————————————————————\nThis extension is against Spotify's Terms of Service.\n\nSpotify is a trademark of Spotify Technology S.A., registered in the U.S. and other countries.
