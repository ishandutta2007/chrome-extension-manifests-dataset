STRWBRY's job is pretty simple â€” highlight a word (either by double clicking or dragging the mouse) and a popup of that word with the Spanish translation(s) and a button for the English pronunciation will appear.\n\nSTRWBRY should be very helpful for ELL since vocabulary is a large part of the language learning and this eases the process of learning new words.\n\n**Only provides Spanish translations**"
