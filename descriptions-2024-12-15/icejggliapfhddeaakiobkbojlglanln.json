If an unrecognized caller comes in, their information can be saved as a Lead or associated with an existing Contact. The overall advantage to the Call Connector is that once an inbound or outbound call is completed, the activity is logged. Notes can be associated with the activity to give more detail about what the call was about. The user can also create follow-up tasks to make sure the next steps required after the call are not forgotten."
