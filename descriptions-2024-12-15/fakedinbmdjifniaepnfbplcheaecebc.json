The idea behind Crackbook is that delaying\naccess to the website is more effective than straight blocking because you\nare less likely to just disable the block after a while.\n\nThe extension will delay every hit to blacklisted site. The delay is just\na few seconds initially, but it increases slightly on every hit.\n\nRevival Changes:\n- Removed attempted reporting of anonymous usage data (which wasn't working anyway due to original site being offline).\n- Delay timer resets on specified intervals (which was already in the original repository but was not published on the store).\n- Hide scrollbars until the content is revealed.\n- Some fixes for the history graph.\n- Some fixes for the options interface.\n- Add option to use a blurred overlay - courtesy of @prettymuchbryce\n- Pause video and audio in the background - courtesy of @nickwb\n- Other minor fixes."
