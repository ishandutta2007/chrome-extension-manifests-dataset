One for standard definition art and one for high definition art. Apple music has high quality art, so this is an easy way to view album/single/etc. art at a high resolution while browsing RYM.\n\nExtension will only be able to get links for releases that already have an Apple Music link in the social media section of the page, and will only return the art that Apple Music happens to use for their version of the release.\n\nExtension was inspired by and heavily referenced Ben Dodson's tool linked below. \n\nhttps://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/index.html\nhttps://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder/tree/master"
