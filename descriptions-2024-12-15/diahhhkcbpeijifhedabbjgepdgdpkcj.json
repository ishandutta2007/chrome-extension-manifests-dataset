Plus, you can edit those experiences right in your app. This is particularly useful when you want to edit → test → edit → test, etc.\n\nIf you don't know what CommandBar is…\n\nCommandBar is an intelligent layer that product, growth, marketing, and customer teams use to personalize their apps for every user. You can install a Magic Searchbar that lets users search to find their way, a HelpHub to find relevant help content (docs, videos) in-app, product tours, feature announcements, checklists, and surveys. They all feel 100% native, delightfully designed, respect the user, and are configurable without code (if that's your jam) or with a lightweight client-side SDK.\n\nSign up for a free account and turbocharge your UX in an afternoon here: https://www.commandbar.com/get-started"
