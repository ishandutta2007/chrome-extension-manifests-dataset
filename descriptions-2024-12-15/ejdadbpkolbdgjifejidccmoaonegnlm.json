Typically, you'd resort to bookmarking these profiles in you browser or noting them down elsewhere. Bookmarking profiles is challenging on LinkedIn.\n\nWith LinkedPin, regardless of whether you are constructing a pipeline of job applicants, searching for investors or recruiters, developing industry ties, or researching about expected associations; anytime you find an individual of interest on LinkedIn, click \"Pin Profile\" and the profile is bookmarked for you with tags and notes.\n\nYou get a dashboard where you can view, sort, filter and edit all your pins too."
