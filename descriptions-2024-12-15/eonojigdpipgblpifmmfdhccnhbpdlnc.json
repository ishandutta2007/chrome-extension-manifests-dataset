Among many features that upset its longtime readers, The Number Ones column hit the rawest nerve by moving the rating for each song to the top of the column. This extension puts it back where it belongs.\n\nAll users have to do is install the extension. There is no additional UI, apart from an entry added to the Extensions page. When a stereogum.com Number Ones column is loaded, the extension will automatically fire and guarantee the old suspenseful experience where readers wondered just what rating Tom was going to end his column with.\n\nThe document doesn't add or remove any info from the contents of any page, and doesn't collect any info, doesn't transmit any info to any other device, and doesn't add any info to the user's device, apart from the change described above."
