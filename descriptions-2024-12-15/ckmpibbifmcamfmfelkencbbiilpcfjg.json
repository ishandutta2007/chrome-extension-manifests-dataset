If you've been recording a video, you might want to avoid redoing the whole recording by post-editing it and adding blur on sensitive data.\n\nIf you are running a webinar or a live call, it could be too late, and some attendees could have already made a screenshot of some private information you didn't intend to make public. \n\nIf all of this sounds familiar, ZeroBlur is the perfect companion for you!\n\nWith ZeroBlur, you can select specific elements or areas of your app or website that you want to be blurred. Choose if you're going to blur them only on one particular page or site-wide, and you're good to go!\n\nNever again show your sensitive data during your calls and demos! Forget video post-production to blur out data! Everything will be already blurred when you hit the record button!"
