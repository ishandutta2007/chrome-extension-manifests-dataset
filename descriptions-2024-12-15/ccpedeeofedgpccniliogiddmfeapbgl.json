Since it's impossible to include such a long list of information on every page I give you:\n\"Boris Johnson: Adject Failure\"\nThe extension will add tiny reminders of Boris' character (and character flaws) by means of appending carefully crafted adjectives to mentions of his name on a web page.\nWhether it is his innumerate affairs, his constant lies, his apparent attempts to arrange for a journalist to be assaulted or his all consuming self-interest rest assured this extension will constantly remind you that, no matter how charming the story is you're currently reading, Boris Johnson is...\nThis is my first extension, and has been nailed together in an afternoon during treatment. Any errors, issues, etc. then - yeah.\nFeel free to donate in the options.\nSuggestions for additional Adjectives - drop me a line."
