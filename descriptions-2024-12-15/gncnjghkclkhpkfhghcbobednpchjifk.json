Project is currently abandoned.\n\nThis browser extension shows you whether the consent registered by some cookie banners corresponds to your choice.\n\nIt queries Consent Management Providers (CMPs) of IAB Europe's Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) as a third party (like advertisers), making it possible to see consent set by CMPs in real time.\nIn other words, you can see whether consent registered by cookie banners is actually the consent you gave.\nWill only work with cookie banners of IAB Europe's TCF.\nSee the presentation of our study of the TCF: https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/cookiebanners/"
