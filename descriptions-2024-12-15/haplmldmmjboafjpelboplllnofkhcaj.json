In addition, some websites show their footers, sidebars, or even ads in their PDF printable versions.\nThis chrome extension makes the printable versions of those PDFs much nicer for popular websites.\nIn addition, it is open sourced for people to be able to contribute to making other websites they frequently print or save as PDF much nicer.\n\nAll you have to do is install the extension, and it will make supported websites look better when being printed, automatically. ( ;\n\nSo if a website is supported, its Print Preview will look better than usual! \nIf it isn't supported, and you'd like us to support it; kindly check the GitHub link in the bottom to raise an Issue requesting a website to be supported!\n\nCurrently Supported Websites:\n         - Medium websites\n\nIf you wish to contribute, kindly go to :\nhttps://github.com/nizarmah/fineprint\n\n( :"
