Reactime enables developers to record snapshots of application state, jump between and inspect state snapshots, and monitor performance metrics such as component render time and render frequency.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Record Snapshots of Application State and Accessibility Tree\n- Import and Export Snapshots of State\n- Time-Travel Debugging\n- Snapshot Series Comparison\n- Component Tree Visualization\n- React Router Compatibility\n- Component Render Time & Frequency\n- Support for Gatsby, Next.js and Remix\n- TypeScript Support\n- Ability to Reconnect\n- Web Performance Metrics\n- Tutorial Walkthrough\n- Prop visualization both in color and thickness of the branches of connecting the components\n- Heat map bar underneath the top menu\n\n\nWhat’s New!\n\nReactime 25.0 includes a new prop visualization feature and heatmap bar for developers!\nWe also addressed the previously reported freezing issues on start and brought up the Jest Library in much better condition as it was before; from 20% of the tests working to more than 85% now working correctly.\nSome of the UI was rearranged to be more aesthetically pleasing and render the main window bigger for the diplay of the component tree in the process.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@loganjnelsen/reactime-v25-the-time-to-react-is-now-ace90e45a9c7\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\nWhy is Reactime telling me that no React application is found?\nReactime initially runs using the dev tools global hook from the Chrome API. It takes time for Chrome to load this. The current workaround is to navigate to your Chrome Extensions and refresh Reactime. Then, navigate back to your application, refresh the page, and then within the Reactime Dev Tool, right-click and hit \"Reload Frame\".\n\nWhy do I need to have React Dev Tools enabled?\nReactime works in tandem with the React Developer Tools to access a React application's Fiber tree; under the hood, Reactime traverses the Fiber tree through the React Developer Tool's global hook, pulling all relevant information needed to display to the developer\n\nThere is a black screen instead of the Reactime extension\nTry refreshing the application you want to test and refresh the DevTools by clicking the right mouse button “Reload frame”.\n\nI found a bug in Reactime\nReactime is an open source project, and we'd love to hear from you about improving the user experience. Please read the DEVELOPER README in GitHub and create a pull request (or issue) to propose and collaborate on changes to Reactime.\n\nBy default this only our app only injects content scripts into localhost.\n If you would like it to run on more websites please go to https://github.com/open-source-labs/reactime. Fork and clone the repository and change\n\"matches\": [\"http://localhost/*\"] to \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"] in the manifest.json src\\extension\\build\\manifest.json"
