The great thing about this extension is that it filters out profanity on other sites, too!\n\nI will be updating this with more features in the future; top ones on my list include:\n\n- add your own blacklist of words to filter\n- right-click on a word to blacklist it\n- exploring technology to filter out profanity in images (for example, this will NOT filter out profanity others save in a picture)\n\nThank you! I look forward to sharing a cleaner web with you :)\n\nIcon is based on \"Clean\" by asianson.design from the Noun Project\n\nChangelog:\n- Feb 2023: fixing an issue with \"dic*\" catching too many things that aren't profanity\n- May 2022: applied to titles, and added a delay on reddit to catch comments as they load"
