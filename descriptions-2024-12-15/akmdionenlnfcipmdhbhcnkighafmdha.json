Videos will be in mp4 format. There's no watermark added to videos or images (like other download extensions sometimes do). \n\n1 - After installation, you will see a download icon (down arrow) under every tweet containing a video or an image.\n2 - Simply click the download icon.\n3 - Video will be downloaded when loading complete. Look in the Download menu of your browser to locate the item. \n\nBONUS: Webinar audio and video are now one click easy to record! When viewing certain webinar pages a RECORD button may be available making it a snap to record the webinar and have the video sent to you afterwards. Never miss another webinar or meeting. Local recording is always free. For cloud recording (which does not use your computer) a subscription service from Zoomcorder may be required. Also webinar recommendations may appear on certain video meeting pages for high quality webinars."
