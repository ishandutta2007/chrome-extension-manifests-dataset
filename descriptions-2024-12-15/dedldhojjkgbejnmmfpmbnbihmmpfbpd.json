Clicking the extension icon when you visit any of the thousands of websites supported by the service will allow you to send a GDPR or a CCPA data Access or Deletion (right to be forgotten) request, directly to the right person at the right organization. You can even send custom requests to websites not in our database.\n\nHow it works:\n1. When you visit a website and wish to get a copy of your personal information, or want the website to delete your personal information, click the extension button\n2. Fill in the required information\n3. Click the Review & Send button to create a request email addressed to the right person\n4. Review the email, and send it\n\nThanks to the GDPR legislation in Europe and the CCPA legislation in California, organizations located in these regions, or with clients located in these regions must comply with Access and Deletion requests or face considerable fines. Our experience shows that most large organizations worldwide comply with requests, even when the individual is not located in one of the above regions. Your Digital Rights is a free & open source service and does not collect or sell any personal data.\n\nVisit our website (https://yourdigitalrights.org/) to search and submit requests to thousands of companies.
