YOUTUBE HAS NOW RETURN SORT FEATURE.*\n\nThis extension will remain available. With 1.4.3 it should be able to shut itself off. It will also stick around for youtube shorts since they dont seem to have sort feature yet.  \n\nThis extension allows for sort by oldest feature on YouTube channels pages. New feature in 1.3.0 includes a loading animation which shows status of loaded videos. If desired, this can be disabled in the extension settings.\n\nNew in 1.4.0, adds oldest for YouTube shorts and livestreams. \n\n1.4.1 fixes bug in YouTube shorts.\n\n1.4.2 fixes bug in oldest to latest.\n\nNOTE: This extension is soon to become obsolete as YouTube is to reinstate the sort by oldest feature properly. This extension was never made as a perfect fix to its removal and does not function exactly as the original. Thank you to all who use this extension, I really appreciate it.\n\nData collected is for internal clickstream use, it is not personal data."
