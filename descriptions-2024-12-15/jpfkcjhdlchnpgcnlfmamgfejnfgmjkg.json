Mask your location, access locked websites, keep hackers at bay and manage your ExtremeVPN app from anywhere.\n\nWhat is a VPN Chrome Extension?\n\nA VPN for Google Chrome is the best way to get a safe and secure browsing experience directly from Chrome. It seamlessly integrates with your Chrome browser, and it benefits you like a regular VPN app.\n\nThe only difference is you don’t need to open the ExtremeVPN app on your device but rather on Chrome browser as an extension. Install our VPN extension on Google Chrome and protect your sensitive data while enjoying internet freedom.\n\nWhy You Should Get ExtremeVPN’s VPN Extension for Chrome?\n\n- To guard your internet traffic from snoopers\n- To deactivate WebRTC and prevent leaks\n- For online security and privacy\n- To conceal your IP address and location\n- To unblock geo-blocked content globally\n\nWhy Does ExtremeVPN Stand Out as the Best VPN for Chrome?\n\n✔️ Best-in-class Encryption and Security\nExtremeVPN offers elite-level security for its users. Our robust VPN servers and 256-bit AES encryption are what make us the best Chrome VPN extension today. These features protect users from cyber threats and hackers and help them achieve the best privacy online.\n\n✔️ Enhanced Privacy at All Times\nHide your IP address with a single click with ExtremeVPN’s Chrome extension. You will get a new IP address different from your real one so that no one can see what you're doing when connected to the internet.\n\n✔️ Fast VPN Network\nOne prime feature of our Chrome browser extension is the fast speed we attain because of our widespread server network. Choose from our 6500+ servers from over 78 countries worldwide, and you’ll be connected in no time.\n\n✔️ Easy to Setup\nNo extra requirements are needed. Just download, sign up, and connect. Our VPN browser extension is user-friendly, and it only takes a click for you to encrypt your browser traffic and data.\n\n✔️ No Data Caps or Limitations\nExtremeVPN’s browser VPN offers unlimited bandwidth and never restricts or disturbs your web browsing. You can securely stream popular titles or shows from anywhere without any limits.\n\n✔️ A Name of Trust\nThere are many free VPN Chrome extensions available on the internet, and all of them come in different shapes and forms. However, not every software is what you should trust. ExtremeVPN’s proxy extension provides a safe, fast, and unrestricted connection so you can enjoy the full internet experience with peace of mind.\n\n✔️ Strict No-logs Policy\nExtremeVPN prioritizes user privacy and security, and we don’t collect or store any of your activities or data.
