Whether it’s an Amazon page for a bracelet, a YouTube video about your favorite content creator, or an article, you can ask your questions directly to Lupin. \n\nWith Lupin, on each tab, you can have at most 80 chats before it's erased to utilize the storage. Moreover, only the 5 most recent-used chat histories' are stored. So, the 6th newest chat is cleared. \n\nMoreover, you can decide to clear the chat yourself as well if you'd like. There is an information button on the top right to help you use the Lupin more efficiently. \n\nFinally, another functionality is that there is a download button which writes the chat history on the respective tab to a pdf and downloads that pdf. \n\nCurrently [October 27, 2023] Lupin is in its Open Beta phase, so it’s completely free until the designated cumulative usage we have is fulfilled. Then, we will officially launch it. \n\nIf you have any improvement ideas or if there are bugs you detected, please reach us at atilla[dot]colak[at]outlook[dot]com. \n\nTill we meet again, \nEnjoy :)"
