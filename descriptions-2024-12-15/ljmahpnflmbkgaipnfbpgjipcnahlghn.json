The Firefox Profiler website is a powerful tool that enables in-depth analysis of performance data, helping developers identify and address performance bottlenecks.\n\nUsing the extension is simple: click the Firefox Profiler button to start recording, then perform the actions you want to profile. When you're done, click the button again to capture the profile.\n\nOnce the capture is complete, the Firefox Profiler website opens automatically, allowing you to explore detailed metrics, visualize performance traces, and gain insights into the recorded profile. Profiles can also be easily shared with colleagues, enabling fast and effective collaboration on performance issues.\n\nFor added convenience, you can use Ctrl+Shift+1 to start and stop the profiler without clicking the extension button. When youâ€™re ready to capture the profile data, press Ctrl+Shift+2 to finalize the profile and open it in Firefox Profiler.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the Firefox Profiler documentation: https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/"
