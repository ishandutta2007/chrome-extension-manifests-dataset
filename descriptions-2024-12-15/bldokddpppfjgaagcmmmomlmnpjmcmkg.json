Estimate agile effort or relative size of user stories, also known as story points, or complexity.\n\nStart by creating a room and sharing the link with your team. Everybody joins from their web browser. The Scrum Master (moderator) shares the story description on Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack or on a screen projector. Every team member votes with a story points estimate, relative to the anchor story which the team collectively agreed on.\n\nThe most important feature of 3pts.dev is that users cannot see other votes until everybody has voted or the moderator has shown the votes.\nWith the Scrum Poker App open source extension you can see the story description side-by-side with the voting cards.\n\nDon't be alarmed by the permission requirements, the extension is open source: https://github.com/3pts/chrome-extension . Feel free to install it directly from the repository."
