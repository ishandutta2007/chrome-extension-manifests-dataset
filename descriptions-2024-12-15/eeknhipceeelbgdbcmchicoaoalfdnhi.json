By hovering a piece of text on the page, highlights in the toc-tree its position (with some exceptions!!!) and expands only its parent-nodes. Thus, we have the BIG-PICTURE of what we are reading.\n4) You can change the WIDTH of ToC or webpage.\n\n== Code ==\n* Licence: GPL, MIT.\n* Source-code: TableOfContents--git-repository @ GitHub\n  (http://github.com/nikkas/TableOfContents)\n* WEB-PAGE of source-code|extension:\n  (http://synagonism.net/program/table-of-contents/)\n\n== Evolution ==\n* My html5.id.toc.preview format (http://synagonism.net/hitp/) creates a ToC on ANY browser.\n* In 2010, I published my JAVA open-source HtmlMgr program  (http://htmlmgr.sourceforge.net/) where I propose, for the first time, how we can create webpages that anyone can refer to any part of them and we can read easily.\n\n== Acknowledgement ==\nMany thanks to those I have studied their codes:\n1) HTML5 Outliner by Dominykas Blyžė. I used his implementation of html5-outline-algorithm.\n2) http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/  for the expandable-tree code.\n3) EasyReader extension of Anton Johansson\n4) Chrome Outliner by genki.gthp.net.\n5) jQery-Splitter, Dave Methvin, http://methvin.com/splitter/"
