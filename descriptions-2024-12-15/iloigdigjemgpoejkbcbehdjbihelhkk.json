I've created it because I got furious at various news sites that autoplay videos in background, often somewhere along the text or in the sidebar.\n\n**This extension has zero analytics, tracking or any other data gathering and it will stay this way forever.**\n\nThe extension may be a bit less stable until I figure out all the bugs and quirks on Manifest v3. Apologies for that!\n\nWHAT'S NEW\n\n- 2.3.1:\n  - Fix the logic deciding when to mute tabs, including when to evaluate whitelists/blacklists and what \"keep muted state\" means. This should fix the issue where tabs would not be muted or unmuted correctly compared to the previous version of the extension.\n---\n2.3.0:\n  - Fix context menu actions\n  - There is a major change in the behaviour of the \"Keep muted state of the opening tab\" flag. Previously due to a mistake two separate features have been merged together - keeping muted state and muting all tabs by default. This has now been fixed and you can set the two settings separately. Existing users will have them both enabled if they had the feature enabled before.\n2.2.0: Rewrite service worker to prevent issues with MV3 being garbage standard that keeps glitching and killing things in the background\n2.1.0: Corporate ad-driven garbage bullshit requirement update (converted the extension from manifest v2 to v3)\n2.0.1: Update privacy practices\n2.0: Removed popup, added options page and context menu instead. Clicking on mute icon will now toggle mute status.\n1.2: Added popup with multiple options and settings\n1.0: Initial release"
