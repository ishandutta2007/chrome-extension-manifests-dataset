Does it take hours out of your day? Well hopefully this app with help get you some time back in your day.\n\nHow to use:\n   1. Click the chrome extension. \n   2. Go to \"Answer Questions\" and fill out the form on the page. When you are done, click \"Save\".\n   3. Then go to ZipRecuriter and search for the job you want. Make sure you have all of the parameters selected for the job you want.\n   4. Then click the chrome extension and click \"Start\". It will then go down the page and apply to each job that has a quick apply function. If ZipRecruiter asks you a question, it saves the question in the \"Answer Questions\" page for you to answer later, and if that question ever comes up again, it will remember your answer and submit it for you.\n\nThis is a beta version, so there may be a couple bugs. Please report any that you see."
