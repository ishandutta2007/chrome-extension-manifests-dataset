This can be useful as an ad-hoc way to save a browser session.\n\nUnlike similar addons that save to a text file, this extension saves the open tabs as HTML, which can be re-opened in the browser later and the URLs re-opened with a click.\n\nThis addon does not store or archive the pages themselves. It only saves the URL and title of the page.\n\nIncognito tabs are excluded."
