Most people tend to buy cheaper products, but which are cheaper? $18.38 for 48 Fl Oz or $27.49 for 101 Fl Oz? It's difficult to calculate each products' unit price manually. UnitPriceHelper is a solution to unit price comparation. It calculates the unit prices of products automatically and attach unit price tags to the product listing pages and product description pages, thus helping customers figure out each item's unit price."
