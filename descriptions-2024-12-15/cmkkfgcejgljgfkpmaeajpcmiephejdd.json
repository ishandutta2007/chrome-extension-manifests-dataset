When a search returns irrelevant results, it is tedious to narrow the search to focus on the results you need. pickySearch improves your searches by making it easy to include and exclude words from your search results. Your search is going to get better with every click until you’ve honed in on what you are looking for!\n\npickySearch is easy to use. Use the plus and minus buttons above the title of each result to add or exclude words from your search query. Once you’re satisfied with your newly refined query, search again! You can add or exclude as many words as you like until you’re satisfied with the search results. If you change your mind or select the wrong word, click the Undo button that appears in the notification appearing in the top right corner."
