(And it will maybe not work correctly on all sites). There are some default sites in settings, which you can try.\n\n* First time you may have to allow clipboard pasting on the language site in your browser.\n\nIn settings for this extension, you can under the section \"Code Snippet Sites\" add, which sites (use location.origin for site), you should be able to run code snippets from. \nUnder \"Language sites\", you can add sites where code should run.\nSo when you visit a site like https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-column, there should be a play-button over example code, which you can click to open e.g. https://onlinephp.io/, where the code is inserted and run.\n\nYou can see a video that shows how you can use it to run code snippets from ChatGPT on CodePen.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5beElSRSBKw"
