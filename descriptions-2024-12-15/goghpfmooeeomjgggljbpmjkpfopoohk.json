Please contact the developer if you have any problems or questions.\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The creator of this extension does not claim responsibility for any missing or altered information that may affect a student's graduation status. This extension only formats but does not alter any student information. To ensure that you have all of the necessary requirements, see your academic advisor."
