However, studies show that most effective precommitments are those that remind about a commitment rather than explicitly taking away a choice. This extension follows the same idea. You can setup your precommitments in the extension and save it. For example, you can pledge to only read 1 reddit post or watch 2 youtube videos. After saving the commitments, the next time you visit youtube.com or reddit.com, the extension will generate a small notification reminding you of your pledge and hopefully help you enforce the pledge that you made to yourself!"
