It supports over 40 languages and is compatible with a wide range of websites, such as news outlets, blogs, fan fiction sites, academic publications, educational materials, and online course content.\n\nWith Narrator+, users have the freedom to choose from a diverse array of TTS voices. These include browser-native options and voices from leading cloud-based TTS services like Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson, and Microsoft. Access to some premium cloud voices may require an in-app purchase.\n\nNarrator+ is versatile, offering compatibility with various document formats including PDFs, Google Docs, Google Play books, Amazon Kindle, and EPUB files (through the EPUBReader extension from epubread.com).\n\nDesigned for those who prefer listening over reading, individuals with dyslexia or learning disabilities, and young readers, Narrator+ aims to make digital content more accessible.\n\nTo start using Narrator+, simply navigate to your desired webpage and click the Narrator+ icon in the Chrome menu. It also supports shortcut keys such as ALT-P, ALT-O, ALT-Comma, and ALT-Period for Play/Pause, Stop, Rewind, and Forward functions, respectively. Users can highlight text for reading and access Narrator+ via the right-click context menu for selected text.\n\nFor voice, speed, pitch adjustments, or to activate text highlighting, users can modify their settings on the Options page. This can be accessed by right-clicking the Narrator+ icon and selecting Options, or by clicking the Gear button on the extension popup (note: playback must be stopped to access the Gear button).\n\nNarrator+ is an open-source initiative. Contributors interested in submitting bug fixes or translations are encouraged to visit its GitHub page at https://github.com/sherwinvishesh/Narrator-Plus."
