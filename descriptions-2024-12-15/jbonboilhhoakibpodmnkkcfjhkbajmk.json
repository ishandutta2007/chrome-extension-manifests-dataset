When the button's color is red, the add-on is active and when the color is lite grey, it is inactive. Please note that the default state is active. When you open a YouTube page and play a video, the add-on automatically loads audio source only and prevents the video content from loading. This way, you will save your internet bandwidth because the video content is much larger compared to the audio content. Moreover, when you just want to \"listen\" to a video, there is no need to load the video content at all.\n\nNote: if you see any errors while the addon is active (i.e. the audio is not playing), please reload the page once. Moreover, this extension is not working for live video items.\n\nImportant note: Audio Only for YouTube™ add-on does NOT belong or relate to YouTube and has NO affiliations with Google Inc. or YouTube website at all. It is an unofficial extension that is developed and maintained independently by its author. YouTube™ is a registered trademark of Google Inc.\n\nIf you have a feature request, or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/audio-only-for-youtube.html)."
