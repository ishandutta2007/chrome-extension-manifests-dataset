Once saved in the extension directly or by the right click context menu, the links are synced with your Google account for one time access when you want. Other functionality includes the ability to save an entire browser session as one link and the ability to add notes to saved links/sessions. LaterLinks also features a history of all previously saved links and sessions - from here, you can save multiple links at once to your Bookmarks.\n\nNOTE:\nDue to the limits of Chrome's storage across Google accounts, 512 is the maximum number of links that can be saved at any given time."
