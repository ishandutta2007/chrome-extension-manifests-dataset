Breathing exercises can enhance the production of noradrenaline, a chemical messenger in the brain that, when produced in the right amount, can benefit our attention and overall brain health (Zelano, C., et al., 2016).\n➤ STRESS REDUCTION: According to a study in the journal ‘Frontiers in Psychiatry’, slow, controlled breathing practices can stimulate the vagus nerve, leading to a reduction in stress and the promotion of calm feelings (Ma, X., et al., 2017). This can be particularly helpful in high-pressure meeting situations.\n➤ EMOTIONAL REGULATION: A paper published in the ‘Journal of Neurophysiology’ found that controlled breathing exercises influence the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, appetite, and sleep. By managing our emotional responses, individuals can participate more constructively in meetings (Noble, P. J., Hochman, S., & Gozal, D., 2019).\n➤ BLOOD PRESSURE AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH: The American Heart Association cites that deep breathing exercises can help lower blood pressure, which in turn helps individuals remain calm under pressure, promoting more productive meetings (Joseph, C. N., et al., 2005).\n➤ ENHANCED DECISION MAKING: Oxygen is essential for optimal brain function. Deep breathing exercises can increase oxygen supply to the brain, supporting improved clarity and decision-making processes (Gerritsen, R. J. S., & Band, G. P. H., 2018). This is crucial during meetings where decisions need to be made efficiently and effectively.\n\nWhether at work, while studying or for private use, join us in our mission to improve lives through movement.\n\n🌚 STAY IN TOUCH 🌚\nThank you for supporting our project.\n➤ Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/micromovehq\n➤ Connect with us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/micromovehq\n➤ Contact us: hello@micromove.io\n\nLearn more at https://micromove.io"
