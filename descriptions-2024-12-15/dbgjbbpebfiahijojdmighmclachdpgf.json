Clicking the icon displays a popup with links to all the episodes. Clicking a title will open a new tab and navigate to that episode on hellointernet.fm. The extension will recheck for a new episode every 15 minutes. If a new episode is found, a notification is displayed.\nI'm pretty sure I'm the only one who has a use for this.\n\nPlease note that I am not affiliated with Hello Internet, CGP Grey or Brady Haran.\n\n- Update 1.0.9: Fixed another problem with special episode titles\n- Update 1.0.8: Yet another bugfix\n- Update 1.0.7: Fixes a problem with the handling of malformed episode titles (again) and changes the behaviour for the badge number back to the old way (unnumbered episodes get a special badge and are otherwise not counted)\n- Update 1.0.6: Fixed a bug with unnumbered Episodes (sorry about that)"
