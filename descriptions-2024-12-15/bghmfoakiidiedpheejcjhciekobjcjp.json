If the page has mounted video or audio media element's, their events and property state changes can be observed as they happen.\n\nWrapped native functions:\n- eval\n- setTimeout/clearTimeout\n- setInterval/clearInterval\n- requestAnimationFrame/cancelAnimationFrame\n- requestIdleCallback/cancelIdleCallback\n- video/audio events&props\n\nMotivation:\n- To expedite issues discovery, here are some examples from experience:\n\n    * A ~10ms delay interval constantly consuming approximately 10% of CPU from a third-party library, solely to check if the page was resized.\n    * A bundled dependency library that utilizes the eval function, thereby preventing the removal of unsafe-eval from the Content Security Policy (CSP) header. It can be arguably intentional, but also may reveal a configuration issue when the package was bundled with webpack config's devtool: 'eval' in production mode.\n    * A substantial number of hidden video elements in the DOM that were consuming resources, unexpectedly limited to 100 medias per domain.\n    * An unattended interval that was unintentionally left running and contributed to a slowly growing memory.\n\n- To explore the internals of a complex systems.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/zendive/browser-api-monitor"
