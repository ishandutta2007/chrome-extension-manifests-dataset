This will update your chosen sport profile pace settings and create a phased training target using the sport profile.\n\nTrenolar works within the boundaries of the Polar Flow abilities. On the Polar Flow website you can only create a phased training using a sport profile and you can only select the 5 pace zones of that sport profile to run in. The same restrictions apply to Trenolar. Trenolar only simplifies the required steps for you by adjusting your pace zones (lower limits) and creating a phased training that uses those zones. Trenolar sets up you paces and zones per phase in the training so that you get a warning from your watch when you go too fast/slow.\n\nAt the moment you can create a training json file here:\nhttps://trenolar.azurewebsites.net\n\nIn the future, it's possible that the Trenara training app (https://trenara.com) will include an export option for Polar that will create the json to upload without the need to create this file manually."
