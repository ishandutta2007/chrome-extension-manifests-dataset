There is an opportunity to open Internet resources, Google search, opening links, scrolling through pages of sites and control browser tabs using voice control. \n\nThe extension has a fairly easy interface. Soon the control will be implemented in more than 15 languages, including the English version. \n\nTo work it is desirable to have a good microphone or laptop with a built-in microphone, as well as a room without noise. \n\nTry again, if you do not succeed at the first time. You will need some time to practice and memorize voice commands. You'll soon find that it's easier than it looks at first glance.\n\nHave a great experience!"
