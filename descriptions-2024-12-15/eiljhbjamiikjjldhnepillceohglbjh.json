With a list of events associated with each extension ever installed (as long as \"Extension log\" is always enabled).\n\nAside from its main purpose, \"Extension log\" records a log of the date and version of every chrome update.\n\nYou can save the whole log history, in case of crash. Right click the extension icon and select \"Export log\" (save the whole page or one of the textareas). No restore function available yet, but you can access the stored values manually from the background page's javascript console (and update from there if necessary).\n\nEL allows you to save extensions packages in its original format or as a zip file.\n\n2018-12-31: (0.5.6)\nBadge used to warn user when an event occurs: now fully functional.\nYou can now import options, and chrome version history from a backup. Import of events is still in beta.\n\n2018-09-12: (0.5)\nExtension packages can be saved as CRX and/or ZIP files.\nThe list of current permissions for all extensions is displayed in the tooltip of their version number.\n\n2018-09-04: (0.4.11)\nAdded support to download CRX packages.\n\n2018-08-22: (0.4.10.1)\nSome minor fixes and layout improvements.\n\n2018-07: (0.4.9.8)\nStable version. Still missing import data feature. Almost done but development halted at least for several weeks. Sorry.\n\n2018-06-19: (0.4)\nStill in beta, but shouldn't crash."
