It comes with a wealth of built-in DeFi applications to meet various Dapp usage scenarios for users.\n\n**What makes Native Wallet different from other Crypto Wallets?**\n\nNative Wallet is a keyless self-custody wallet that leverages Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. From private key generation to signing, it never creates, stores, or shares private keys at any time. By using the Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol, it replaces traditional single atomic private keys with multiple independently created private key shards, thereby eliminating the risk of private key single-point theft.\n\nNative Wallet - Secure & User-Friendly."
