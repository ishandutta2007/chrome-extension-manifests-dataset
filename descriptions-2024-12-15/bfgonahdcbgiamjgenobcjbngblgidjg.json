It allows the user to interact with the content of videos through following features:\n- asking questions about the video\n- summarizing videos\n- extracting transcript, where clicking a sentence jumps to the timestamp it's spoken\n- finding keywords / phrases within video's content\n\nKeep in mind that the answers accord to the video's content and that Owlie is not aware of your previous questions.\n\nIf you end up liking the extension and feeling generous, please do consider donating :)\nhttps://ko-fi.com/owliext\n\nGithub: https://github.com/martinezpl/owlie-yt-addon"
