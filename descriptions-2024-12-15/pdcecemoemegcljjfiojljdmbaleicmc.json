That means there could be some bugs, but there's an easy-to-use button to submit any questions or concerns to support :)\n\nAre you looking for a super fast way to document your processes? \n\nWe have good news! With the Flowster Capture extension, creating your own fully-customized workflows has never been easier or faster.\n\nFlowster Capture generates screenshots each time you click your mouse or use your keyboard. These screen grabs are more easily-editable than screen recordings, plus if you pair Flowster Capture with Flowster.app (optional), you can build out fully-functional templates and SOPs.\n\nThe Flowster Capture Chrome Extension is way less time-consuming than recording yourself talking over video, or taking screenshots and manually annotating them. Plus, by avoiding video-based screen recordings and workflows, you will also avoid the painful process of having to re-shoot or edit all your videos to keep them up-to-date.\n\nReady to speed up your business process creation? Start using Flowster Capture today!\n\nNote: Flowster Capture does not require you to have a separate account at Flowster.app; however, if you do decide to get a free account at Flowster.app, you will unlock even more functionality and get access to hundreds of pre-made (fully customizable) workflow templates."
