Check out \"UCCOM Extension\"; It includes these shortcuts and more!\n\nThis extension provides simple keyboard shortcuts for the current (new) Echo360 video player. The shortcuts are modeled after Youtube's and are listed in the extension popup. \n\nThis extension was created quickly and was meant as a personal extension; however all are welcome to use it. A copy of the source code can be found on the website link.\n\n\nUPDATE 1.16: Speed and play/pause will work when multiple videos are displayed. Internal Echo360 error prevents skipping while multiple videos are playing.\n\nUPDATE 1.1.5: Made spacebar control more reliable, should work on second keypress if the first does not correctly control the video. Due to Echo360's underlying code, this may be as good as we're able to get."
