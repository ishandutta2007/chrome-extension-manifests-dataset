Flip the switch and watch the background dim and your messages take center stage, becoming more vivid and easy on the eyes. And now with Scheduled and Sunset to Sunrise modes, you can tune your messaging experience to the sun's natural rhythm.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nMessenger Black features three modes designed to help you get the most out of Dark Mode, whatever your uses might be:\n\nüéõ Manual: Put yourself in full control with a single switch to enable or disable Messenger Black. Useful if you want to always have Dark Mode on.\n\n‚è∞ Scheduled: Set a start and stop time from which you want Messenger Black to run. Useful if you want to align Messenger Black with your own schedule or home automation system.\n\nüåÖ Sunset to Sunrise: Our most sophisticated mode yet, Sunset to Sunrise automatically turns Messenger Black on at sunset and off at sunrise, matching your circadian rhythm and the surrounding environment.\n\nEach of these features can be enabled or disabled from a convenient control panel in the Chrome toolbar.\n\n\nPRIVACY\n\nSunset to Sunrise mode in Messenger Black uses your approximate location about once per day to determine the sunset and sunrise times in your specific area. This location is only used temporarily and deleted immediately after use. For more information, please refer to our privacy policy at messengerblack.com/privacy.\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nIf you encounter any issues with Messenger Black or would like to give general feedback or suggestions, please email messengerblack@ryanmohta.com, and we will get back to you in one or two days."
