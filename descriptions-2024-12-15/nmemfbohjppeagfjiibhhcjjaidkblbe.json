In this game, you guide a snake to consume numbers from 1 to 9 sequentially. Eating numbers out of order will result in a game over.\n\nHow to Play?\n\n1) Starting the Game:\n   - Click the extension icon and the game will start in a popup window.\n   - The game area will display numbers from 1 to 9, placed randomly.\n\n2) Controlling the Snake:\n   - Navigate the snake using the arrow keys.\n   - The snake moves continuously, and you can alter its direction to head towards the desired number.\n\n3) Eating Numbers in Order:\n   - Your objective is to eat the numbers in ascending order, starting from 1 and going up to 9.\n   - Successfully consume each number in sequence. For example, find and eat '1' first, followed by '2', and so on up to '9'.\n\n4) Avoiding Mistakes:\n   - Be cautious not to eat the numbers out of order. For instance, eating '2' before '1' will result in a game over.\n   - Similarly, avoid colliding with the game area's walls or the snake's body.\n\nHow to Win?\n   - When the snake successfully eat all numbers in order, you win the game.\n\nTips for Success:\n   - Focus on Sequencing: Always be aware of the next number you need to consume. Plan your moves to reach it safely.\n\nGo ahead and test how quickly you can win the game!
