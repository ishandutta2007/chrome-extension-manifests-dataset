You set a length between 5 and 20 characters, if you want it to contain upper-case, lower-case, numbers and special characters and click generate. Since I'm into the habit of wanting passwords that look good I've made it so you can choose to generate between 1 and 5 passwords in one go to make it easier to get those.\n\nNow simply choose the prettiest of the generated passwords and you're done! ;)\n\nVersion 0.2 has support for themes, you can select between three different ones, but you can also add your own or edit the existing ones if you so wish."
