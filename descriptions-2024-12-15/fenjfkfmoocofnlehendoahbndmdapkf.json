This makes it quicker, easier and more cost effective to find and engage with the best talent. All whilst keeping things simple and pain free for candidates.\n\nHow it works:\n\nIf you have access to the job seekers email address via LinkedIn (e.g. they are a first degree connection or you have a LinkedIn license) then this will be used to create their record in your ATS. If not then they’ll still be created using the information available and searchable within your talent pool, plus it'll save a link to their profile so you can find them again.\n\nTo get started, just enter your specific organisation API key (you can request one from our support team) into the settings page to get started. You’ll also have access to a history page to show all of your past imports and their LinkedIn and ATS profiles.\n\nTribepad is the easiest-to-use enterprise talent acquisition platform. It empowers organisations to build powerfully straightforward experiences that continually transform their recruitment. \n\nOnly Tribepad combines robust functionality with profound usability. Used by 25-million people in 16 languages, Tribepad helps enterprises attract, source, nurture, screen, interview and onboard the right people (employees and contractors)."
