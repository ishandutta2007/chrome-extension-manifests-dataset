Have you ever had to look up the time zone your friends and family are in? \n\nMaybe they are on vacation or just living in another country or another time zone in your own country.\n\nThe World Clock lets you set clocks for four different time zones so you can see at a glance what the time is in another part of the world.  Select the time zone you want for each clock.\n\nFeatures: \n- A dark clock face indicates night time - a time between 8:00pm and 6:00am.\n- The clock's state is remembered by your browser so your current selections will apply when you open this page again.\n- provides links to other tools from LinangData, the LinangData home page, and the LinangData YouTube channel\n\nReleases:\n1.0.7 - manifest version 3, look and feel, SVG library, digital date/time for each clock"
