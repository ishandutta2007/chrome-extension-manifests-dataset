To begin addressing this challenge, the FAIR guiding principles were established. However, software to systematically assess, store, and display the FAIRness of biomedical digital objects is currently mostly not available. FAIRshake is a browser extension that enables the assessment of compliance of biomedical digital research objects with the FAIR guiding principles. In order to visually communicate FAIRness level, a 3x3 grid of colored squares, called the FAIR insignia, was developed. The FAIRness insignia identifies areas of strength and weakness in the FAIRness level of digital objects, guiding digital object producers on how to improve the FAIRness of their products. The Chrome extension provides easy access to display and perform FAIR assessments on any relevant web-site. FAIRShake is also a cloud-based application freely available at http://fairshake.cloud."
