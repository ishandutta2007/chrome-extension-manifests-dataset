We have several tools in the extension that will save you time. \n\nFeatures:\n1. SQP fetcher - allows you to schedule Search Query Performance (SQP) downloads for groups of ASINs across multiple date ranges. Reports are downloaded to your desktop. Reports can be downloaded and combined into a single CSV or downloaded for each each ASIN as individual CSVs. It also includes the option to sum across date ranges and includes the same support for brands.\n2. Advertising Console TACOS chart - the extension automatically renders an optional TACOS chart on the campaigns page on Amazon's advertising console. This helpful chart adds additional KPIs like TACOS (Advertising spend / total sales), % of Ad Sales (Sales from Advertising / Total Sales), PPC CVR (Conversion Rate for PPC), and Unit Sessions Percentage. The chart works on the same date range enabled for the native chart on the campaigns page. \n3. Product detail page parent-child table - An optional table that automatically loads on Amazon product detail pages. The table lists all of the child variations and their ASINs across all of the associated themes and options available. The widget includes a native clipboard to copy the data directly into Google Sheets or Excel. \n4. **NEW** Google Drive integration - Push data downloaded using the extension directly into a Google Sheet or Google Drive Folder of your choice. Simply choose the sheet you want to write to, map the columns of the data to the columns of your sheet and run any report. \n5. **NEW** Search Catalog Performance Report - Download the SCP report just like the SQP fetcher. \n6. **NEW**  Top Search Terms - Download the Brand Analytics Top Search Terms report in bulk with filtering for search terms, reporting ranges, and more.\n\nWe're still actively developing this project, and we look forward to adding more features to save you more time.\n\nData privacy note: All of the functionality for our Chrome Extension is fetched using the extension and runs in your browser. We do not require API or Seller Central credential access of any kind. \n\nUpdate: Nov 24th, 2024"
