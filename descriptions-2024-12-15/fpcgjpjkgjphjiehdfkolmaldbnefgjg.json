It's free, safe and secure. Just click the \"Add to Chrome\" button above.\n\nThis extension is particularly helpful for those using version 76+ of Chrome (as of July 30th, 2019), as Flash is turned off by default, which has made it more complicated for players to turn it back on. \n\nNote, this extension allows Flash support at www.replaypoker.com only, it does not affect any other websites.\n\nReplay Poker Team\nwww.replaypoker.com"
