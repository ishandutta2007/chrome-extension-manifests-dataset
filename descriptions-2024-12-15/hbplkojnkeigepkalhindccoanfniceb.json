When working with multiple repositories, tabs can quickly become indistinguishable, leading to confusion and reduced productivity. This extension addresses that problem by giving every repository its own unique favicon.\n\nWhy Install It?:\n\nClear Visual Differentiation: Each GitHub repository tab gets its own unique favicon, which is dynamically generated to display the first three letters of the repository name on a black background. This makes it easier to find the right tab, especially when you have several GitHub tabs open.\n\nEnhanced Productivity: Quickly switch between repositories without wasting time searching through similar-looking tabs.\n\nLightweight and Seamless: The extension works quietly in the background without any impact on performance or requiring extra permissions beyond GitHub.\n\nNo Data Collection: This extension respects your privacy. It doesn't collect, store, or share any data, and only modifies the favicon of GitHub pages.\n\nIf you often find yourself juggling multiple GitHub repositories, GitHub Favicon Changer can save you time and keep your browsing organized. Install it now to enjoy a cleaner, more efficient GitHub experience."
