Optimize your transactions with low gas prices.\n\n- Monitor recent gas prices across various ETH-based networks every 10 minutes.\n- Receive notifications when gas prices dip below your set threshold.\n\nIâ€™ve powered this tool with the Etherscan API.\n\nLooking for some specific feature or want to see more networks? Reach out to me on X: @Marty_cFly\n\nI've also built a crypto portfolio and explorer extension that supports crypto onchain analytics, find it in the store:\nCrypto portfolio: Blockchain & Crypto tracker\n\nRegards,\nMarty"
