If a website attempts to display an image of Trump and the image is tagged or titled with his name, then you'll get a cute kitten instead. It's so theraputic and is a very effective stress reliever.\n\nIt also deals with pictures of Melania, Tunbull and some other irritating reality tv 'celebrities and douchebag politicians.\n\nNow with support for Nigel Farage\n\nv 004 - fixed bug when content served over https. Added support for blocking Tony Abbott and Pauline Hanson\nv 005 - added support for Drumpf and Dutton. Thanks for the idea David!\nv 006 - added Kellyanne Conway by popular request....\nv 007 - added Israel Folau. For Danny."
