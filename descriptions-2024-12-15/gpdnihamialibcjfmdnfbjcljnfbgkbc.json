Except some special circumstances, that DOM element which exceeds their parent element might be causing the horizontal scroll to the parent. When HTML stack is not properly ordered, this might be causing a horizontal scroll to the HTML body itself i.e. A page level scroll. During development, developers find it hard to detect which element is causing this horizontal scroll. They will inspect each and every DOM element to find the root of their problem manually. This tool will help doing it easily."
