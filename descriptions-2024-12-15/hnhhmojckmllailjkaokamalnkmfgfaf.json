With the ever-increasing presence of ads in search engine results, it's crucial to have a clear distinction between sponsored ads and organic content. This plugin aims to address this need and enable users to identify and understand the nature of the content they encounter during their online searches.\n\nWhen installed, the \"Search Ad Marker\" plugin seamlessly integrates with your Google Search Results, and works to enhance the presentation of advertisements within search results, by clearly showing a different style for \"Sponsored\" results compared to normal search results."
