Digital marketing experts have distilled principles of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science into \"marketing hacks\" that push you into \"frictionless sales funnels.\" To sellers, you're just a \"click\" to \"convert\" into a purchase.\n\nSpend Less helps you escape the sales funnels and keep your money. How?\n\n- Spend Less detects when you're on a seller's website.\n\n- Spend Less delivers beautiful, motivational, and informative messages that help you become more aware of the sales funnel and marketing hacks being used on you.\n\n- If the website is where you want to be, simply dismiss the message and Spend Less won't interrupt you again during your session on the website.\n\n- If you've realized you've been sucked into just another sales funnel though, Spend Less will send you somewhere beautiful and interesting instead (where nobody is trying to take your money).\n\nWhether you want to Spend Less because you're trying to save, reduce your impact on the environment, or simply to become mindful of the \"marketing hacks\" sellers use on you, Spend Less will help you pause and think.\n\nWe invite you to join our growing community of people who have made the decision to Spend Less."
