You’ll never have to worry again about sending sensitive information and having it accessed by anyone other than the intended parties.\nYour data is encrypted before leaving your device and moving to the cloud, which makes it easy for employers to meet data privacy and compliance obligations.\n\n\nEasy Zero Trust Data Protection For Your Digital Workflows\nExtend Zero Trust security control across your entire communication workflow, starting with complete platform email protection. XQ helps teams meet compliance and maintain the recommended safeguards' integrity, availability, and confidentiality.\n \nBusiness Email Compromise\nBusiness Email Compromise is the #1 cyber-attack on businesses today. Breaches from Business Email Compromise and data leaks present a significant business risk. XQ can prevent damage from these attacks in real-time.\n \nThe damage is already done when you notice and remediate the breach.\nXQ immediately notifies your admin when a Business Email Compromise (BEC) occurs and identifies where the attack is originating. XQ helps you reduce the risk of a breach and reduce the time a bad actor has access from months to minutes.\nXQ’s Secure Chat can also help remediate a BEC through its ephemeral secure channels.\nKnow Sooner\nYou know where your email recipients should be\nImmediate notifications if someone is trying to access your data who shouldn’t be\n\nPrevention\nStop BEC while it is happening\nRule sets stop unauthorized access by identity and geography\n\nControl Data After it is Sent\nSet identity, time, and location limits on your data\nRevoke access at any time\n \nFor businesses concerned with Business Email Compromise, XQ is the best choice available.\n \nRansomware Extortion Protection\nWith millions of dollars at stake, ransomware attackers will likely find ways to hack into email even as their protections improve. Hackers will conduct a three-stage attack:\nEncrypt Your Data\n\tEncrypt your data and deny you access to it and your network.\nExfiltrate Your Data\n\tMake a copy of your data\nExtort Your Company\n\tDemand payment each month with the threat of publishing all your intellectual property and customer data to the dark web.\n \n \nXQ encrypted email and files make that data useless.\n \nEach email is encrypted separately with its own key and its own dynamic access policies. Even if someone does gain access, with this level of granularity your email now has a blast radius of ONE. Dont let one mistake jeopardize your entire company.\n \n\n \nLifecycle End-to-End Email and File Encryption Across Email, Files, Chat, Forms\nDeploy a single data control platform across your communications work suite starting with Gmail & Outlook that gives you a single security plane visibility across all your organizations' communications internally and externally.\n\nSecure Sharing\nAs private company & consumer data is shared across cloud environments and disparate networks, XQ keeps it secure with continuous protection and lets you govern access throughout the data lifecycle.\n\nEase of Use\nSenders and receivers should both have simple email and file security experiences. One button encryption for email and files for all users and recipients natively embedded in Gmail & Outlook does the trick.\n\nXQ is the easiest way to have digitally secure workflows and to extend that security to customers, vendors, and coworkers. XQ is layer on security and control that works where you already work. \n\nData Control\nYour data is most at risk after it leaves your possession. With XQ, you retain the ability to know what happens to your data, revoke access to it or reprovision it with granular access controls for Data Lifecycle Management. Keep track of when, where, and by whom your data was accessed and reprovision or revoke access to that data even when it is in someone else's mailbox.\n \nGain effortless and Unprecedented Control Over Your Data\n\nData Blind\nXQ won't read your emails because we never have your data. The encrypted content stays within your existing service (i.e., Gmail & Outlook), and we provide the logic to encrypt, decrypt and modify the policies for data access.\n\nFile Protection\nKeep attachments secure even after being sent from Gmail or Outlook to desktops, shared folders, Google Drive, or wherever files are stored and transmitted. Track when, where, and by whom access attempts occur.\n\nSecure Bubble\nUse XQ to build a secure bubble for colleagues, clients, vendors, and third parties. With encrypted messaging, you can be sure that your data are safe and secure. All of your invoices, contracts, and documents can be securely exchanged. Further, encrypted messages can be used as a verified channel to prevent phishing attacks and establish message provenance.\n \nMessage Expiration\nDo you want an email with your name, address, and credit card information sitting exposed in your vendor’s inbox forever? Probably not. That’s why XQ lets you set an expiration date for any message you send. Choose any length of time, from six hours to six months.\nRevoke Message\nUnsend emails by revoking access to encrypted emails by the recipients. Just click the “Revoke” button, and your email is no longer accessible.\n \n\n \nData Compliance Shouldn’t be a Hassle\n \n \nPrivacy and Compliance\nEnsure only the intended recipients can read private consumer data. Meet the strictest compliance requirements with zero trust end-to-end encryption preventing unauthorized access to email, chat, support, forms, files, and data in flight to the cloud and throughout its lifecycle. XQ helps support HIPAA, PCI, GLBA / FINRA / SOX, GDPR, ITAR, EAR, CMMC, CUI, CJIS, and FERPA.\n \nCross-Worksuite Collaboration\nXQ Message enables your workforce to collaborate and innovate safely in the applications they already use inside and outside your organization. XQ is deeply integrated into your current worksuite protecting data as it is shared across unknown environments.\n \nChain of Custody for Visibility Across Environments\nEach interaction with your data, whether it is IoT, CCTV, email, or chat, is logged with who, where, and when the access was attempted. Each data object has its own individual and unique key and is bound to individual policies. This provides you with an unparalleled ability to manage your data inside and outside your organization. XQ provides a complete auditable trail.\n \nData Residency\nXQ uniquely geolocates each data access request. This also means XQ can geofence data so that it never leaves its designated geography. XQ is the only solution providing geofencing at the data level for GDPR compliance. With XQ, data stays where it is supposed to.\n \nData Control To Power Business\nLifecycle end-to-end encryption data protection\nExtended trust frictionless sharing with customers and colleagues\nMaintain data visibility with audit logs to see who has attempted to access data, track where data travels, and take action to reduce/ mitigate breaches.\nUse SIEM integrations to improve threat remediation workflows.\nCustomize your data loss prevention rule policies from the edge to the cloud.\nUse XQ Secure for protected file exchanges and collaboration.\nSecurely connect site-to-site and on-prem to cloud data transfer\nBAA documents are available upon request for healthcare clients\nYour Data Can Do More\n \nData-Centric Security\nOther solutions protect data by focusing on the security of networks, servers, or applications. XQ protects the data itself. Data-centric security allows organizations to overcome the disconnect between IT security and business strategy by marrying security services to the data they protect; When security isn’t an end in itself, data can do more.\n \nExtraordinary Ease of Use\nChanging behavior is hard. For security to work, people need to be able to use it easily. XQ is seamlessly incorporated into users’ existing workflows for extraordinary ease of use.\n \nFull-Lifecycle Data Control and Visibility\nEasily view who has accessed or forwarded an email — and adjust or revoke data access controls at any time. Integrate XQ with your SIEM to strengthen threat response and streamline compliance audits.\n \nSeamless Experiences\nRecipients who don’t have XQ installed still get the benefits of best in class user experience. \n \nQuick Deploy and Configuration\nGet up and running in a matter of minutes. Period.\n \nData Loss Prevention (DLP) from the Edge to the Cloud\nThere isn’t another system like XQ. Our patented architecture is true data-centric zero trust that future proofs your data security. XQ microsegments data at the edge and encrypts that data object with its own key and policies that protect it and tracks it throughout its life from the edge to the cloud throughout its lifecycle. \n\n \n\n\nXQ keeps your data safe wherever it lives. We protect & track all interactions with each data object from the network edge to the cloud.\n \nOur communications applications protect your data in email, chat, support, forms, and file sharing.\n \nThrough our layer-on patented architecture, our goal is to securely connect data for the entire internet."
