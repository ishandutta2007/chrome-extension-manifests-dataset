The launcher that is in Gmail is perfect for this, but you have to have your inbox loaded to be able to use it.\nThis extension is basically a copy of that, however it uses direct links to each service's URL. This means that the extension doesn't need to know anything about the user, and the popup will also appear almost instantly.\n\nThe icons are made sortable, and the order will be remembered using local storage.\n\nTip: Instead of clicking on the 'More' link to show the rest of the icons, you can mouse wheel down, and the rest of the icons will appear. Then when you wish to collapse the panel again, mouse wheel up to make sure the scroll bar is at the top, and the click up once more."
