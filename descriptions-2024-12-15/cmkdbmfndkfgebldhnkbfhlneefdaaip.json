From Developer Tools and Ad Networks to Wordpress Plugins and Themes, we detect even the new and upcoming tools and services.\n\nNot just that - you can follow websites so that you get notified when they use new technologies or remove existing ones. \n\nFAQ\n\nHow do you know what runs a website?\nEvery technology leaves a pattern on the websites it is being used. WhatRuns' algorithm recognizes these patterns to detect the tech stack of a particular website.\n\nWhat all things you identify on a website?\nWhatRuns detects almost everything that runs a website - frameworks, web technologies, CMSs (and its plugins), themes and fonts to name a few categories.\n\nHow is WhatRuns different from extensions like Wappalyzer, BuiltWith, Datanyze and Ghostery?\nWhile all of these are good old products, WhatRuns is less heavy on your browser, has a better detection accuracy and recognise even the latest technologies and plugins compared to our counterparts. We also uncover fonts, Wordpress plugins and themes used on websites, which nobody else does at the moment."
