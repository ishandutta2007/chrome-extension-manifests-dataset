It integrates with the school's course selection website, automatically parses course information into\nrecurring calendar events, and allows one-click export to Google Calendar.\n\nPRIVACY\nPrettyPeopleSoft works by overlaying content on top of the original website. Hence it does NOT store any data from your browser and does NOT pose additional risks to using PeopleSoft.\n\nSUPPORT\nIf you encounter any unknown issues, please try turning off the extension and refreshing PeopleSoft. If the problem persists without the extension, it is likely a problem with PeopleSoft itself. \n\nThis extension is only optimized for a limited number of institutions using Oracle's PeopleSoft. Please contact me if you are interested in adapting this to your institutions' website.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nPretty PeopleSoft is not affiliated with Oracle Inc.
