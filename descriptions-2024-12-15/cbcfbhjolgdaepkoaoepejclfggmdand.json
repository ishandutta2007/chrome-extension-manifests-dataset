Word banks provide core vocabulary that can be used for vocabulary development, spelling support, to gain the gist of an article, aide in recalling previously learned words, and can be used to help support writing.   Word Bank also summarizes and extracts important people, places, a timeline, and numbers from web pages.  \n\nCreate a word bank with a click of a button of any materials or articles online.  The key vocabulary of the website you are on will instantly be made into a word bank, a summary is built, and people, places and times/numbers are extracted.  Or… simply search over 5+ million topics to extract and create a word bank of that topic.  \n\nTo use the word bank in your writing, hover over the words and listen to them out loud.  If you’d like to enter that word into your writing, there’s no need to retype, just click on it, and it will be inserted wherever your cursor is placed.  \n\nDepending on your purpose, you can adjust the word bank’s layout.  If you’d like to use it for writing and finding words, an Alphabetic layout supports finding words easily.  If you’d like a word bank to obtain the gist of an article and the most important vocabulary used, then a Circular layout will place the most important words in the middle and less important words towards the outside.  \n\nTry it for free and see if it works for you.
