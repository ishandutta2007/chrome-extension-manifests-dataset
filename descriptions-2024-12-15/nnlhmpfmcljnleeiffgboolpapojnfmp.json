While this is great for small communities and websites starting out, other websites are plagued with spam bots, predators, and keyboard-warriors that have to be blocked/ignored manually every time they create a new account.\nCodychat Anti-Guest automatically removes any messages created by a guest (or to be specific, any Rank 0 user) every few milliseconds. This creates an effect where you can't see the message, automatically \"Ignoring\" them.\nTo install Codychat Anti-Guest, you have to use Google Chrome, Brave, or Microsoft Edge. By clicking the button above labeled \"Add to Browser\", you will install the extension. Codychat Anti-Guest requires no further configuration and is automatically enabled on the more popular Codychat websites.\nIf you wish to review the code behind the extension, either to ensure it is reliable or to learn, the source code is freely available at https://github.com/logicallylogi/antiguest and is fully commented and documented."
