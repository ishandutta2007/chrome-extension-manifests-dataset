With a bit of extra flashiness added in, it not only replaces all your browser text with Comic Sans, but it randomizes the colors as well. To give the pages some dimensionality, the images are replaced with a random gif of the user's choosing and elements of the web page are constantly spinning. Finally, to easily let you know the extension is on and working correctly, the background colors rapidly transition between multiple colors."
