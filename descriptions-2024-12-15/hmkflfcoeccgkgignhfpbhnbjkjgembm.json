This Chrome extension makes it easy to source great talent from open source projects on sites like Github, GitLab, and BitBucket by giving you the ability to download the entire commit contribution history to an excel sheet with a single click.  This extension gives you access to who did what on every open source software project, and includes the email address that they associated with their work.\n\nI have open sourced this extension to share it freely and allow for further customization.
