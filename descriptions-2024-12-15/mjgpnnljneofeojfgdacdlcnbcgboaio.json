After you stop recording, it will automatically create a guide including the screenshots of the screens and the texts typed during that time.\n\nOnce the recording is ready, you can customize it by zooming in/out the screenshots or adding annotation texts.\n\nThatâ€™s it! You are all set to start sharing this demo with anyone with an easily shareable link."
