Wait no more! Here comes the auto formatter for wide columns. It automatically converts big text blocks in websites into columns,  which are easier and more relaxed to read. Text size is increased  to 16px, which is the recommendation of w3c and designers as default font size of normal text. If a page does not display correctly because of fancy css in the design of some pages, you can always disable and enable the extension/columns by clicking on the button in the toolbar. it works without reloading the page. \n\nyou can turn off the badge-number in the options menu of the extension. \n\nv1.19: cleanup code. removed customization of stylesheet, use another extension if you want to do this. \nv1.18 : migrate to manifest v3\nv1.16 : small bugfix \n\n\nMore details:  \n\nThis plugin uses latest css3 column-width property to layout the blobs of text in paragraphs as nicely readable columns. Works with all websites, best on long boring text, eg. news articles. Screenshot of wikipedia is only one example. \n\nThe plugin has an icon to toggle the state, and keeps your current format-style for all open pages. The plugin is smart enough to detect which paragraphs to convert, eg. 1 or 2 liners are kept, if images or video/iframe (youtube) embeds are detected also the original format is kept, this way the layout looks best. \n\nFont size is set to 16px which is good for normal reading distance, but not too big. Font is set to Verdana which works good with this column-sizes. \n\nThe first letter is a bit bigger, so one can easily detect a new row of columns. \n\nThe paragraphs are split into several columns and adopt to your browser width or the available width in the layout. most of the layout is preserved, but the readability is improved. With the toolbar-icon you can always turn back to the original layout, but after some time the new columns look normal and long lines look odd. \n\nWith extension-options you can change your preferred column-width, min-height and font-style for paragraphs. \n\nOptimizations for Wikipedia: \n* Read in columns\n* navigation is on top and collapsed and shows on hover\n* column width for images is optimized for column width."
