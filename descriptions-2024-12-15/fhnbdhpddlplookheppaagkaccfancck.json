Yeah me too. Are you ready to take back your attention for good?\n\nPomegranate provides a solution by helping you focus with the extra help of an enforced website blocker.  The timer is built to be based around the famous Pomodoro® Technique** where a user focuses a chunk of time to solely focus on their task and takes a series of short and long breaks in between. You have the added ability to redirect your blocked URL to any URL of your choosing: a redirect to a Youtube video of \"nails on a chalkboard\" will help you get back to work in no time (given that's your style).  In addition to being able to redirect links, there is also an \"exclusive mode\" that disables all timer functionality and turn the app into a straight-forward website blocker that runs in the background.\n\n\n*Website Blocker (With a bit of honest encouragement when slipping up)\n\n*Pomodoro® Timer (With short and long break intervals)\n\n*Redirect Mode (Redirect blocked sites)\n\n*Exclusive Mode (Only block websites)\n\n*Wild-card Search for URL (This means that entering \"facebook\" instead of \"facebook.com\" will still block Facebook. Note: Any URL that contains the phrase \"facebook\" will be blocked for the former case.  The latter case will be more strict in enforcing the official Facebook.com.\n\n*Statistics (Completed pomodoros/breaks)\n\n*Tastes like fruit\n\n\n\n**Pomodoro® is a registered trademark of Francesco Cirillo.
