This can give you some additional leverage about your opponent’s playstyle, current performance and experience without having to look at their profile. Saving you time to focus on the game instead and therefore maybe just giving you the edge over the opponent.\n\nUser preferences: Your choices of info that should be displayed is saved in your browser, so you don’t have to worry about losing your settings.\nCustomization options: Tailor the information about your opponent to your specific liking to minimize the amount of cluttering information while still gaining some inside information into your opponent.\nChange Theme: Choose between a dark or light theme for the addon popup using the slider in the bottom right.\n\nChangelogs:\n[June 2024] Initial base-functions: average rating, account age, win rate over last n games and total games played."
