The user navigates to a tab he/she needs to focus on for an amount of time and then starts the timer using the extension's pop up. Doing so locks the tab as the 'FOCUS TAB' and if the user navigates to some other tab then he/she is redirected to a 'fail' page. The user then has to go back to his/her FOCUS TAB and continue their work on that tab until the timer runs out. The user can stop the timer manually as well.\n\nWith various distractions on the internet, it is hard to focus on your important online course or the google docs file you been working on. This extension helps you bring your focus on tab at a time."
