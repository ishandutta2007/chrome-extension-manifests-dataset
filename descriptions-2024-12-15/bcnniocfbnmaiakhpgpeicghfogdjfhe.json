Yeah, me too.  So I made this.\n\nWelcome to Filter Affinity!\n\nIt filters out content based on artist names and keywords in the submission titles and short descriptions on the Home, Browse, Gallery and Search pages. If you wish to always display artwork by a certain artist, their names can be listed to allow to do just that.\n\nHovering over a submission thumbnail will show a Add/Remove option box. Clicking the plus(+) symbol adds the artist's name to the filter list automatically. Clicking the minus(-) symbol removes the artist from the filter list.\n\nYou can also filter by the submission rating, and even just block out the entire submission or just hide the thumbnail!  Easy!\n\nNo longer worry about scarring your eyes with material you'd rather not stumble across.  Try out Filter Affinity today!"
