This plugin is for you. It's one click to unsubscribe and stop those pesky emails from coming back.\n\nWhat this is:\nThis is a free extension and I do not keep or see your data at all, the app runs off a script and just helps you automate the process and save your fingers from the trouble.\n\nWhy I made this:\nFor years I spent so much time scrolling through emails searching for the unsubscribe button. It took so much time and energy. \nThis plugin was created to help you quickly unsubscribe from mailing lists on Gmail or other email clients. \nCurrently this plugin has been tested and works on outlook.com emails, and in Gmail email accounts. \nLanguages supported: \nEnglish\nFrançais (French) \n한국어 (Korean) \n\n*Updated 1/23/2024\nAdded functionality to respond to two more email types\n\nHow to use: \nJust open up the email you want to unsubscribe from, and then click the plugin icon to get you started on unsubscribing. \n\nIf it was a success, a new tab should open asking you to confirm your unsubscribe request, or notify you that you've unsubscribed.\n\nIf there was an issue, or the email was too long, the email will open up bigger in the same window. At that time just click the unsubscribe icon for this google app, and it should unsubscribe for you in a new window.\n\nIf nothing happens after you click unsubscribe (once or twice):\n1. It's possible it's a scammy email! This app doesn't support 'image' link unsubscribe requests because clicking those can be really harmful, instead please mark the email as spam and block the sender. Always double check who the email sender if and make sure emails look legit before clicking the unsubscribe icon for this app. \n\n2. It's possible that some words in the email/vocabulary aren't supported by this extension. Feel free to submit a report and it can be considered as a fix for future versions.\n\n3. The mail site might not be supported! File a request for support.\n\n4. There might be another issue! File a request for support with as many details as you can gather.\n\n\nHow you can help!\n\nPlease leave a review if you enjoyed it, I love seeing this app get more users, and it makes me feel glad if I helped someone solve a problem in some way. Feel free to share this extension with your friends too.\n\n\n\n+++Update Notes\n4/10/2023 : Version 0.2 Release:\nIn this update two major issues were addressed:\n1. Dealing with emails that have broken HTML code, and 'look' okay, but the button doesn't work.\n\n2. Dealing with emails that seem to have been created via WIX, that hide under a <u> html element. \n\nIn this update, for emails with broken html this solves the issue where when you click the unsubscribe me icon--nothing happens. Now you should see another page open up where you can see the document shown in full HTML format, essentially you get taken to the \"Show HTML Message' link in Gmail. This fix really only works in Gmail. It was coded to reflect the email format of gmail. From there you can click the unsubscribe me button again and get to where you need to be.\n\n4/13/2023: Version 0.3 Release: \nUpdate included adding functionality to unsubscribe from Google.com android store subscription emails, or links in emails that say 'here'\n\n4/18/2023: Version 0.4 Release:\nUpdate included functionality for manage preference link in emails.\n\n7/31/2023: Version 0.5 Release:\nUpdate included added support for emails labeled: \"Manage email preferences\", and other fixes for when the link didn't trigger. \n\n8/31/2023: Version 0.6 Release:\nFixed a bug in the code that prevented some emails from unsubscribing when the Unsubscribe Me button was clicked. Also deleted unnecessary and unused image files causing bloat to package size.\n\n9/14/2023: Version 0.7 Release:\nIncluded fix for emails from disneyland.com which uses wording Manage all subscription preferences.\n\n9/28/2023: Version 0.8 Release:\nOverhaul of the code, improved readability and fixed logic bugs that were leading users to manage emails when an unsubscribe link was also available.\n\n11/26/2023: Version 0.9 Release:\nAdded functionality to support Korean and French Language Emails, took out Mackenzie Dev LLC as company is shut down.\n\n11/28/2023: Version 0.10 Release:\nFixed bug on a certain email not running through with one click.\n\n1/23/2024: Version 0.11 Release:\nAdded more functionality to work with two additional email types.\n\nAs always, please send me emails, feedback and new feature requests.\nPlease enjoy, and I hope this update helps you get rid of unwanted emails."
