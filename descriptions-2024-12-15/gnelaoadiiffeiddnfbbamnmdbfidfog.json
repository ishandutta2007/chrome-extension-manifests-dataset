ASCII art is supported with main consideration being the max width of the popup window (800px)\n\nWe invite everyone to give credit to the teams responsible for the web applications we use every day, by installing and using this extension. Our hope is to reward creative people for their hard work and encourage them to do even more through recognition of their contributions. \n\nOriginally created as a weekend hackathon organized by Makesites.org"
