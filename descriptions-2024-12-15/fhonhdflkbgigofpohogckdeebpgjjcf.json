Authors may use hyperlinks to back up their claims, but authors may also misrepresent the information contained in those hyperlinks. Embellishment, spin, sins of omission, and even outright fabrication do occur, however seldom in mainstream journalism.\nPreliminary research using Vetted, has demonstrated that misrepresentation and missing context occurs more frequently in print journalism than one would hope.\nVetted takes care of the tedious fact-checking so you don't have to. Right now, our beta version of Vetted is available for free!"
