Just install it, click the extension icon, enter you're information, and you're good to go.\n\nThis only works for the Berman wifi network. It will not attempt to log you in anywhere else or do anything outside of the Berman wifi network.\n\n==============FAQ==============\nQ: Why does this need access to my browsing history?\nA: It is part of the bundle of permissions that allows this extension to open new tabs to log you in. It is doing absolutely nothing with your browsing history."
