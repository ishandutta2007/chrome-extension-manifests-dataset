It will darken all the websites you visit so that you can browse without straining your eyes\nDark night mode is a free and open source software, which makes all the websites you browse enter dark/night mode, so you can browse the Internet without any effort. For those who use the Internet, this is a very useful chrome extension, especially at night.\n\nWe use a unique algorithm to apply dark mode to all websites in real time as you browse. It basically detects the color of each element of the website and intelligently converts it into a darker shade. Bright colors are darker than dark colors, so most of the colors are retained. Unlike other similar extensions, we do not invert the colors, so black sites will not change their colors to white. An additional benefit is that the image will not be distorted! I think we have been hit by the robot's one-star rating because we are the only extension with this intelligent algorithm. Now, after this extension became popular, another super famous extension copied our function.\n\nUsing the brightness slider, you can adjust the brightness of your browser beyond what your computer's brightness adjuster allows. This is useful in dimming the brightness to your likening. For example, by default, the images are shown with normal color, but you can darken them by sliding down the brightness slider.\n\nSince this extension will darken all the websites you visit at night, you won't like it initially because your daily work has changed drastically. However, our internal research shows that people begin to get used to it after about three weeks of use. Some people claim that this extension can help them sleep better, while others say it can help them reduce the burning sensation in their eyes caused by surfing the Internet in the dark.\n\nThis plugin is NOT 100% perfect. It never will be perfect because many websites are developed in a non-standard fashion and there is no easy way to detect a site and perfectly change its colors in real-time within milliseconds so that the user does not see the bright colors. It is a double-edged sword - If we add more conditions to make the algorithm smarter, then it will affect the processing speed and the user will see flashes of white light, so we had to make some choices to get an optimal balance."
