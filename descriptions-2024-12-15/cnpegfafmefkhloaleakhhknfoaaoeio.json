This provides an easy visual indicator to help you make lineup decisions, trades, and waiver pickups.\n\nThe hot and cold status is determined by analyzing a player's key batting statistics like AVG, OBP, SLG over the past 7 and 14 days. Thresholds for hot and cold statuses are calculated to identify when a player is on a tear or in a slump compared to MLB averages.\n\nTo provide fast analysis, the extension caches each player's recent stats in the background and updates periodically. When the Fantrax page loads, the content script injected by the extension checks for player names and displays the corresponding icon based on their cached statistical status.\n\nBy quickly identifying which hitters are hot or cold right on the Fantrax site, the Fantrax Baseball Hot/Cold Indicator takes the guesswork out of finding out who is performing well recently. This helps you make more informed lineup decisions and stay on top of player trends throughout the season."
