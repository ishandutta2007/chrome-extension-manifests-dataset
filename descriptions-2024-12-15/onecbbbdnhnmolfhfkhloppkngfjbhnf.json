This information is used to help create a more relevant, interesting and entertaining online experience for all Australians. \n\nJust as television ratings identify which programs attract the most viewers, the data collected by the Roy Morgan Research Community App allows us to determine the popularity and importance of different websites and applications. \n\nThe data is collected and transmitted anonymously to us by the App ‘in the background’ – we call this ‘passive tracking’. It does not require any further activation on your part.\n\nThe Roy Morgan Research Community registration is by invitation only"
