BETA VERSION !!\n==================\n\nThe extension is currently in testing. Some minor issues remain:\n\n - Sometimes tabs don't reload automatically when they should, and the user has to manually press the back button.\n - Using the \"Suspend other Tabs\" feature accidentally closes some tabs.\n\n\n\nHow Tabs are Stored\n===================\n\nThe suspended tab is stored in a \"Data-URL\", which can be synchronized by Chrome's builtin Synchronization feature, such that the \"Recent Tabs\" feature on mobile devices and other PCs can be used. Since Data-URLs are local, no browsing information is sent to any server (other than, if enabled, Google's sync servers), so no privacy-issues should arise.\n\nTabs that have been suspended by the timer, or by \"Suspend Other Tabs\" will reload automatically, when they are revisted.\n\n\n\nComparison to similar Extensions\n================================\n\nCompared to \"The Great Suspender\", the Data-URLs enable synchronization with mobile devices, where the extension cannot be installed.\n\nCompared to \"TabMemFree\", the Data-URLs prevent loss of browsing information, when something deletes the tab's history (e.g. due to a crash). \n\n\n\nDeveloper Mode\n==============\n\nThe app includes a \"Developer Mode\" option, which adds a lot of debug information to the interface and to the JavaScript console."
