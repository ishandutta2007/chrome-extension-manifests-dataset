Click on the search icon.\n4. Page full of links opens in a tab, go to any of the link therein you will find your content and some more related content. Find(\"Ctrl + F\") your link on the page and download it.\n\nIf you want to look for some-specific file extension like .exe, make query in the fashion \"a.exe\".

Don't worry it is no problem."
