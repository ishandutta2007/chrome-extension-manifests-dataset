It's a great way to evaluate add/drop and trade decisions, especially if your league format differs from a site's default rankings.\n\nIt currently works with leagues hosted on almost any platform: Yahoo, ESPN, CBS, Fantrax, or NFBC.\n\nNewly-relevant players will be added periodically. If there's a player you want added, send me their player IDs from FanGraphs and the league site, and I'll make sure they are added."
