You definitely don't remember it enough to find it in your actual search history. You only remember vaguely what it was about, but nothing more.\n\nSemantic Search History allows you to use the latest in NLP to look back into your past search history and turn generic thoughts into relevant search results that you've made in the past. No need to remember exact keywords, we handle that for you."
