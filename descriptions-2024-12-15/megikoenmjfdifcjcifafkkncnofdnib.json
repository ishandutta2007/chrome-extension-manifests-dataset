This extension shows the University of Wisconsin Football and Basketball Schedule. It's easy and quick to access information about the Badger schedule. Don't know what network the game is on today? Here's an easy way to see. \n\nCurrent information displayed include date, time (if upcoming), result (if completed), current team standing and record, opponent, location and what network the game is on.\n\nI will be expanding the extension to display more information (such as full conference standings) in the same easy to find and easy to read format.\n\nQuestions or comments can be directed at me on Twitter, @jeffbricco or through the Google Group. GO BUCKY!"
