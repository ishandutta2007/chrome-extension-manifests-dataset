So each drop of neon rain has a 50/50 chance of duplicating or disappearing.\n\nOn top of that, the color of each droplet changes and varies depending on many factors. This allows you to have the most interesting experience possible while gazing into the gentle atmosphere created not by me, but by pure luck.\n\nIf you want a calm break for your personalized environment, tailored by randomness itself then this extension is exactly what you're looking for."
