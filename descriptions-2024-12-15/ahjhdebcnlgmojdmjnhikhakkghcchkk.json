It also supports regular expression (including wildcards), color picker, and positioning preferences. \n\nWhen it comes to IT projects, it is very common having multiple environments: dev, QA, stage, and production. \nAll those environments' interfaces are mostly identical, and as a consequence, mistakes may happen very often.\nWho had never faced the situation when we intended to do a \"little test\" thinking it was doing in \"dev\" and suddenly realized that was in the production environment, and ended up applying a configuration in the wrong environment? After all, screw-ups are easy to happen because the look and feel of those sites are the same except by the discreet URL in the browser address bar. \nThat is when the Environment Marker Extension comes into play. The Environment Marker is a free and open-source Chrome extension that allows you to configure the URLs of your project's environments and assign a colored \"label\" on the corner of the browser window, identifying the environment for you.\nNo more screw-ups in the production environment!\n\nAvailable functionalities:\n- Color picker to configure label color.\n- Support regular expressions in the URL address (regexp).\n- Support to choose the position of the label: Top-right, Top-left, Bottom-right, Bottom-left.\n- Support \"Quick Config\" mode: an easy and fast way to set it up.\n- Export and Import feature. \n\nHow to use:\n\n- After installing, access Bowser Configurations > More Tools > Extensions \nOR \nClick on the red pencil on the right side of the address bar.\n- Click on the Options menu, over the Environment Marker section.\n- Configure your Environments and click on the Save button.\n\nLatest release notes v1.1:\nNOTICE: Before updating make sure that you have a backup from your configuration. You can export your configuration using the \"Export\" functionality under Bowser Configurations > More Tools > Extensions and go to the extension \"Options\" menu.\n- Introduced a new way to import a file hosted by a server. You can choose whether you want to automatically import the file in case of any changes occur.\n\nEnvironment Marker is OpenSource and contributions are welcome!\nhttps://github.com/geovanneb/envmarker"
