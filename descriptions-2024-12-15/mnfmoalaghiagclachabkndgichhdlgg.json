Through Wayward, creators can earn up to 3-5x more on each sale than they would through Amazon Associates by simply swapping out a link! This will even work for products that you are already promoting.\n\nThe Wayward extension meets creators where they are - you can now create promotion links while browsing products on Amazon. If the product that you want to promote is not in our catalog, you can browse similar products so that you still earn increased commissions. Just note that we're adding more and more products every day."
