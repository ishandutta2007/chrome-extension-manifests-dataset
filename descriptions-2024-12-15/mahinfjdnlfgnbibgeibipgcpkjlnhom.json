Authoritarian regimes cannot block access to the mirrors without the “collateral damage” of restricting their own access to those cloud services.\n\nDuring a hackaton organised by Reporters Without Borders for Collateral Freedom, this extension has been developped in order to make it easier to access mirorred versions of blocked websites, by adding an icon switching to red when a mirror is available. You then are just one click left to more freedom.\n\nWhen word has been heard that a mirror is no longer accessible in a country, its URL changes, and this change is then applied in the very next start of your browser.\n\nMirrors are hosted on by third-party CDNs (Content Delivery Networks such as Cloudfront, fastly, etc..)"
