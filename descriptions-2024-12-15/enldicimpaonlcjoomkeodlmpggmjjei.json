Sign up https://lockdoc.co/sign-up\n\nHow it works:\n      ðŸ“Ž   Click the blue \"Upload\" button in your Gmail compose window, and select files as normal\n\n      ðŸ”—   A download link for the encrypted files is inserted into the email body\n\n      ðŸ“¨    In order for recipients to download the files, they'll enter a passphrase.
