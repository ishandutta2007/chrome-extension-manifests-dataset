It provides a link to the relevant page on the G2Play and G2A key market platforms to make the transition easier between these stores. Just open a game on the Steam store, and after a second you'll notice the big yellow buttons underneath the Steam \"add to cart\" button!\n\n--Currently in public beta--\n\nFAQ:\n\n-Are these sites trustworthy?\n\nThey are nothing but a digital distribution site for keys. If you have no concerns buying keys on Amazon, they shouldn't cause any worries. \n\n\n- How does it work?\n\nOn the backend I made an API that gets the prices of these games in realtime. It is essential to get the price in realtime because it fluctuates a lot. \n\n-Could you implement \"x\" feature?\n\nSend in your feature and I'll take a look at its feasability.\n\n\n- The prce shown on my steam store page is extremely high. How come?\n\nThis means that the price was correctly scraped for your own currency but the currency sign is wrong. My apologies. I did not foresee this. I will tackle this bug ASAP.\n\n\n\nThis extension uses affiliate links to sustain the server and domain name this is hosted on. This will have no effect on the experience fidelity."
