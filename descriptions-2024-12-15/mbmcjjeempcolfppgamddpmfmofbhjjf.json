As such, I am eligible to receive a small amount of money in the form of referral fees (https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join/landing/referralfees.html) on products purchased.\n\nIf you use my referral ID, then Amazon will pay me a small referral fee whenever you purchase something from them. After the initial setup, you do not have to do anything on your part. My referral ID is automatically added to Amazon links. I do not have visibility in to who is utilizing my referral ID, so privacy and anonymity is not a concern.\n\nThe reason that this extension asks for permission on every site visited is because it parses links to Amazon.com and appends my referral ID to the links, regardless of what page the link resides on."
