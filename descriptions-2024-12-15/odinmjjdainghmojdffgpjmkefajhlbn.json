You press record and do your thing, as soon as you're done the docs are ready to go.\n\nMAKE EDITS FAST\n\nIn seconds you can edit descriptions, markup, redact and edit screenshots - or pick completely new screenshots from a video recording. \n\nMADE TO BE SHARED\n\nShare your Dubbles with anyone with a single click, or invite your team to edit and record guides together. In seconds you can record and send customers, clients, new team members or your mum a Dubble.\n\nMagically copy and paste your guides to wherever your knowledge lives - whether that's Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Trainual - anywhere that supports rich content or markdown works for Dubble.\n\nPROCESSES CHANGE, DOCS DO TOO\n\nHave your docs gone out of date? Don't worry, Dubbles are made to change - no more starting from scratch when one step changes - go back any time and record new steps. No more double-handling, Dubble will handle it ðŸ¤“.\n\nBETTER THAN (JUST) VIDEO\n\nEveryone learns a little differently. Dubble writes clear descriptions and takes screenshots with the option of video, camera and audio recordings too.\n\nWhile videos are great for showing \"how\" for the first time, they're much harder to refer back to when looking up step 34 of your 105 step process ðŸ¤¯. For the best experience for your readers, you can capture it all and allow them to learn the way they learn best.\n\nWHO'S DUBBLE FOR?\n\nDubble is for anyone who wants to take the pain out of creating and keeping process documentation up to date. Great for support, operations and product teams who want to standardize, scale and maintain their best practices with out the headache. Some common use cases are;\n\n- Employee onboarding documentation\n- Internal procedures\n- Customer support - show customers how to do things fast\n- Software product guides and documentation\n- How to's, guides, tutorials\n- Fast screen recordings & screenshots"
