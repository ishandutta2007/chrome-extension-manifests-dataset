When the user clicks on the extension's icon, the extension injects a content script into the active page, which spawns a Web Worker to process the HTML content of the page in parallel.\n\nThe Web Worker uses the HTML5 parser to parse the HTML content and modify it in a separate thread, thus reducing the processing time required by the browser. Once the processing is completed, the worker sends the modified HTML content back to the content script, which then replaces the original page content with the modified content.\n\nThe extension also includes support for parallelizing the playback of HTML5 video elements and Flash content on the page. When the user clicks on the extension's icon, it injects a content script into the active page, which spawns a Web Worker to handle the playback of video elements and Flash content. The Web Worker is responsible for scheduling the playback of video elements and Flash content in parallel, which reduces the load on the main thread and results in smoother playback.\n\nOverall, the \"Page Chip\" extension improves the performance of web pages by utilizing parallel processing techniques to reduce the processing time required by the browser, resulting in a faster and smoother browsing experience for the user.\n\nTo use the extension, the user simply needs to click on the \"Page Chip\" icon in the Chrome toolbar at chrome://extensions/ and enable."
