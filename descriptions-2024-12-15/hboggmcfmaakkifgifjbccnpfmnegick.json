This script will automate the upload of your code to the Roll20 sandboxes. Use your favorite code editor or IDE and let the Autouploader take care of updating the code on Roll20. Tell the extension what directory to monitor when you open a sheet sandbox game on Roll20 and it will take care of updating your HTML, CSS, and translation files in the sandbox as you save changes.\n\nThis initial release only supports character sheet file upload to the sheet sandbox. The API upload functionality is in the works. \n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nThe auto uploader is compatible with most chromium browsers, however Brave has disabled the File System Access API that powers the extension. Other chromium browsers may have also disabled this API."
