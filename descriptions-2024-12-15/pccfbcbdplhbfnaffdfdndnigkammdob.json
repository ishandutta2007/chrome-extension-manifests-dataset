Bluzelle is a decentralized network with its own BLZ token. \n\nInstall this extension and let the extension handle management of your mnemonic. Without the extension, you have to manually keep record of this precious mnemonic, and paste it into the browser app everytime you want to sign a transaction.\n\nWith the extension, the mnemonic (and HD-derived keys) are owned and managed by the extension. Transactions are handed over to the extension, and it signs them. You as the user no longer need to manager this precious information.\n\nYou do need to remember your password, in order to login, and we recommend you always keep a backup of your mnemonic to a file on a medium (like USB stick) where you can recover the key, if for example your PC loses its data, etc."
