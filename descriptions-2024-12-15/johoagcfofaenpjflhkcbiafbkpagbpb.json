It takes a work-colleague of yours a couple of times to see you browsing a non-work-related article, checking Reddit, or Facebook to describe you as a \"slacker\".\n\n👨‍✈️ In dictatorships, people can lose their jobs or even go to jail because they were seen browsing an article on a website that opposes the ruling government.\n\nThe same could happen to news reporters.\n\n\nPrivo is here to fix that. 💪\n\nPrivo wraps the content you want to consume in another website (that you also pick) so that you can do what you want while giving the stalker what they want to see.\n\n\nJust as a VPN makes you seem as if you were browsing the internet from another country, Privo makes you seem as if you were browsing a different website that you picked beforehand (we call these “templates”).\n\nIt is your new VPN on the browser-level. 🌍\n\n\nHow to use Privo?\n\nOpen a webpage or an article (let’s say a CNN article).\nSelect some text on the page, then double click on “mouse middle click”, or right-click then select “Go Privo”.\nAnd voila! Your article is now wrapped within one of your safe websites (templates)."
