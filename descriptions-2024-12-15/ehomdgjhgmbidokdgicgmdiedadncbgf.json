With GMass, the magic happens inside Gmail, using just the red GMass button.\n\nYesware: similar to Mixmax, you can't send campaigns inside Gmail. You have to use their web interface.\n\nPlus, both Mixmax and Yesware are more expensive than GMass.\n\nMailtrack and Snov.io: Lets you track individual emails, but with GMass, you can eliminate Mailtrack and Snov.io because GMass can track both individual emails and campaign emails. Use the GMass button on both one-on-one emails and campaigns.\n\nCopper: Good CRM system, but not meant for sending email campaigns. Same for\nGmelius and Streak CRM.\n\nLastly, GMass works seamlessly with Grammarly to ensure your campaigns contain perfect prose and are error-free."
