It will be supported in the future.\n-\tFor Single Sign-On to Windows native apps, please uninstall this extension and install “USO Chrome Extension”.\n-\tSingle Sign-On to macOS and Linux native apps is not supported.\n\nThis extension helps users in an enterprise to automatically log in to applications by filling in the User ID and Password fields for them. This creates greater convenience for users by:\n- Simplifying and speeding up the authentication process for users when signing in to applications\n- Eliminating the need for users to personally remember or store multiple passwords for different applications\n\nHere’s how the USO Chrome Extension for Web Apps works:\n\nThe user's application passwords are securely stored in a central database. The target applications for each user are configured and entitled to them by an enterprise administrator.\n\nTo use this extension, users must first authenticate themselves to the AccessMatrix USO Server. A wide variety of authentication methods are supported (e.g. password, OTP, biometric, etc.).\n\nThe extension works by detecting the active application’s login screen and checking if it matches an application in the list of applications entitled to the user. Matching is done by checking the screen's properties (e.g. screen titles, URLs, screen labels, fields, submit buttons, etc.).\n\nIf a match is detected, the extension fetches the corresponding set of credentials from the central database and populates the fields on the application’s login screen, automatically logging the user in.\n\nAs the use of this extension eliminates the need for users to remember their passwords, it empowers them to configure highly complex passwords to meet strict security standards; users need only remember a single password to authenticate themselves to the AccessMatrix USO Server.\n\nAdditionally, this extension provides audit capabilities - user activities are audited in the central database."
