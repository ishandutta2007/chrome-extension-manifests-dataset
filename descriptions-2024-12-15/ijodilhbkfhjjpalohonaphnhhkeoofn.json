First of all, it is very hard to reach, having to go through several webpages to end up there. Also, it is not very useful by itself. There are no options to export it to iCal file so that it can be integrated with Calendar apps that have more functionality such as notifications. While it is possible for someone to transfer the schedule to their preferred Calendar app, this process is tedious. The purpose of this extension is to automate this process by giving user the option to directly export the schedule to Google Calendar or export it to an iCal file (.ics)."
