Sadly, there's a lot of misinformation what actually happened and how do they help. We are constantly seeing people trying to help in case of fire, but they are too late or too unequipped. In https://disaster.volunteers.1oflads.com as a part of the bigger group of 1oflads we are seeking of volunteers simultaneously to report for disasters and to help for ones. We need to inform each volunteer right away if disaster happened, so they need to be notified if new disaster comes in the platform. The website in itself has notifications, but once you download this extension, you will receive notifications no matter the website is opened in your browser or not. Use this extension to get notified right away if a disaster happens near your location.\n\nP.S.: Technical point of view: this extension is a simple web socket client to the main platform where each web socket connection is notified after a successful request for disaster is executed. Once a new web socket message is received, it creates a notification. Your operating system should have your notifications enabled, especially for Google Chrome."
