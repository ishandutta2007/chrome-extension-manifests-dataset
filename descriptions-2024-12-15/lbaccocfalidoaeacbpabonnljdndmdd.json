It's an amazing tool for creating tutorials or avoiding the \"demo effect\" when you are doing presentations.\n\nasciinema allows to embed the animations in different places like websites. With Javascript, you can integrate those animations easily in tools like revealjs but there is not a way to integrate those animations with Google Slides...\n\nAfter enabling it, all you have to do is creating draw circle, rectangle or add an image to your slides. Then, add a link to the desired asciinema animation website. For instance: https://asciinema.org/a/14\n\nRemember that, if you add .png to that URL, you will get a preview for the asciinema animation. For the previous example, it would be https://asciinema.org/a/14.png. So, you can include that image in your Google slides and add the link to the asciinema animation: if the Chrome extension is installed, you will see the animation totally embedded in your slides. If not, you'll have a preview linked with the real animation (and that works too for PDF)."
