After pausing for five seconds (adjustable), you can choose to continue to the site, remain on the green screen with the site temporarily blocked, or close the tab.\n\nThe interruption created by Pause gently nudges you to make informed, intentional decisions about how you are spending your time.\n\n- Pause comes pre-seeded with a list of 50 top distracting websites, which you can add to or edit as needed.\n\n- You can also adjust the length of the Pause time (5 seconds is the default.)\n\nKeep Pause enabled in your browser. Itâ€™s a simple and powerful tool to help you control distraction and create more mindful browsing habits that will help you stay focused.\n\nPause is a product of Freedom Labs, where we develop new ways to meaningfully interact with technology.  Like our other extensions, Pause is highly privacy-conscious. None of your data is sent anywhere (the cloud, our servers, etc.) It remains secure on your own device.
