Because too many site owners are shutting off the public's ability to say it as it is, or have never bothered to enable it in the first place.\n\nWe as WebWrap will not censor you. Only other members of the community may flag your posting so others will be able to ignore content they don't want to see.  and you can mark anyone's contribution as not appropriate to the site it wraps."
