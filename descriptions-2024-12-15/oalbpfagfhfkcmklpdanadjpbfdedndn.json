Messenger.\n\nAll you have to do is:\n - Install PotatoSmile (click on Add to Chrome on top right )\n - REFRESH/RE-OPEN your Facebook page [this is important for the first time after installation]\n - Enjoy these jolly emoticons.\n - Spread the smile, share it with your friends using the inbuilt share function in extension icon.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/PotatoSmile\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ. What makes it different?? from those annoying huge-face smiley softwares you find lurking all over the web, which probably infect your PC with malware.\n\nA. Let me break it down into parts for better explanation:\n i) PotatoSmile installs on Chrome, not your OS, and just converts certain symbols to graphical images.\n\n ii) It uses the same smileys you loved in Yahoo! messenger. With the evolution of web, and Google/FB domination, Yahoo! messenger got left alone in the dark, and people now prefer to use Skype/gTalk/FBChat. But still, there's one thing which keeps reminding us of the once-popular IM client Yahoo! Messenger, oh yea! their cute smileys!. We've all used them, we all know their short codes, and most of us miss them too. So here it is, Yahoo! smileys now on Facebook\n\n iii) PotatoSmile DOES NOT believe in spamming and HATES it as much as you. We will NEVER spam your Facebook wall or add a line at the end of each comment saying \"Hey! I'm using this uber cool Chrome extension and you should also try this!\". However, you are free (and humbly invited) to spread the word yourself. :-)\n\nPS: The graphical emoticons can be viewed only in Chrome browsers having PotatoSmile extention. So feel free to share and spread the smile!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any suggestions or bugs to report, drop bombs at PotatoSmile's FB page! http://www.facebook.com/PotatoSmile"
