In title case, the first letter of each word is capitalized, except for certain small words like \"and,\" \"of,\" and \"the.\" This is a common convention used in titles of books, articles, and other written works.\n\nSentence Case Converter:\n\nThis tool that takes a piece of text and converts it to sentence case. In sentence case, the first letter of the first word of each sentence is capitalized, as well as any proper nouns (e.g. names of people or places). All other words are written in lowercase. This is the standard convention used in most written English.\n\nUpper Case Converter:\n\nThis tool that takes a piece of text and converts all the letters to uppercase. In uppercase, all the letters are capitalized. This is useful for emphasizing certain words or for writing headings or titles in a more eye-catching way.\n\nLower Case Converter:\n\nThis tool that takes a piece of text and converts all the letters to lowercase. In lowercase, all the letters are written in small letters. This is useful when you want to write in a more casual or informal style.\n\nAlternating Case Converter:\n\nThis tool that takes a piece of text and alternates the case of each letter. The first letter is capitalized, the second letter is in lowercase, the third letter is capitalized again, and so on. This is sometimes called \"spongebob case\" because it resembles the way Spongebob Squarepants' name is written. Alternating case is mostly used for decorative purposes or to add some personality to your text.\n\nText Case Converter is useful for formatting text according to your preferences or needs, such as writing headlines, titles, captions, code, etc.\n\nText Case Converter is simple and fast to use.\n\nClick on the icon in your browser, Just type the text you want to convert and click on desired case button to convert it.\n\nYou can also use \"Copy\" button to copy the converted text.\n\nIt does not require any permissions or access to your browsing data.\n\nText case-converter is a handy tool for anyone who works with text on the web.\n\nLearn more details about plugin: https://digitalmarketingmind.com/case-converter/"
