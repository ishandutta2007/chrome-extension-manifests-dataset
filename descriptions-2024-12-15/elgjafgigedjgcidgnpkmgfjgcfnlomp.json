This extension covers up the English translation so you can try to translate the Japanese on your own, and once you're done guessing, you can click on the hidden English translation to reveal it.\n\nThere may be bugs I haven't discovered as I am only a humble average developer and I coded this in a short time and didn't do much testing, but it works for the purposes I wanted it for. If there are troublesome bugs discovered with no workarounds I may patch the extension in the future.\n\nIf you need to contact me you can email me at: jackwebster@outlook.com\nGithub repo for this extension: https://github.com/bwalaE/WaniKaniEnglishHider"
