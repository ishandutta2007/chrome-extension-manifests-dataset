This knowledge is transformed into a powerful mind map ðŸ§  for accessing bird's eye view of user's bookmarks. One can also easily access \"Recently Bookmarked\" web pages from extension.\n\nInstall, Bookmark, and Generate Knowledge!\n\nCommon FAQs:\n\nâ†’ Does Bookmark Plus correctly predicts the topic of my bookmark ?\n\nYes, it can even differentiate a music video vs an education video on YouTube. So it understands the context and groups your bookmark correctly.\n\nâ†’ Why I need Bookmark Plus when I have standard bookmarks ?\n\nBookmarks are best way to save information for later, but just saving information can lead to a huge pool of unused information. To overcome that a user can sort bookmarks manually. It is not practical in the long run and in most cases users give up and stores everything in one single folder.\n\nâ†’ How Bookmark Plus fixes the manual sorting fatigue ?\n\nBookmark Plus uses generative AI to attach contextual topics and sub-topics to bookmarks in the best possible way. In addition, we provide better bookmarking experience to Chrome users by implementing two main features:\n\n1. See how your bookmarks are connected with a mind map\n2. Search bookmarks faster with more visual information (thumbnails, descriptions etc.) than traditional ones.\n\nâ†’ Do I have to change my regular workflow ?\n\nNot much. Once the extension is installed, a user can start bookmarking via extension/context manager option and they will see new folders dynamically created with predicted topic in their bookmarks manager. This is essential for mothballing the bookmarks for later use."
