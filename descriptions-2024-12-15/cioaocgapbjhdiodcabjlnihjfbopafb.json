This works with many CTI applications, SIP clients, Skype, snom phones, and Android phones when sync is enabled for the Chrome browser on both devices. In general, any telephony software, device or interface which can be controlled by using an URL, will most likely enable you to call a phone number directly from your browser.\n\nThis is done by passing the phone number to the configured system protocol handler and from there to the application which registered this protocol handler. Just like an URL starting with “http”, a link can also start with other protocol specifiers, e.g. “tel”, “sip” or “skype”. Applications like Skype or Bria Solo register an appropriate protocol handler in the system upon installation. So after installing Skype and using an URL starting with the protocol specifier “skype”, a phone number can be called directly from the browser.\n\nIn newer versions of the Chrome browser, links starting with the tel protocol are handled inside the application. This has the advantage that you can use your Android phone to call phone numbers from your Desktop computer. To use this, sync must be enabled for both devices in the Chrome browser."
