A voice speaks your links on mouse over \n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nUser opinions are very valuable for us, please comment with any suggestion you have!\n\nINFO:\n\nKuunga for Google Chrome™ basicaly overrides the \"New Tab page\". It means that when a new tab is opened, you will see a browser based version of Kuunga.\n\n- Why do I want to use Kuunga?\n\nIt's very simple, it will organize all your links, apps, history, most visited links... All in one easy access menu. Simple and clear, all options are self explained.\n\n- Well, I'm fine with the original \"new tab\"...\n\nWe were too. But we wanted more, we wanted more organization and we are obsessed with easy and fast access to all usual links. So we developed the Notes system. Everyone is used to this: \n\nIt behaves like a post wall. You have the post wall and you can glue all the notes that you want, name them and use them as link folders. Having them all displayed in the screen and gruped by your own criteria lets you find them faster. But the navigation magic is still there... All notes have a title to have the subjects identified, once you click in one title, all links in there will open inmediately in newtabs! This means that you can start your work/home/news... journey with just 1 click, yes, just 1 click.\n\nAll these features are linked with the browser bookmarks, it will add your bookmarks to the post wall if they are placed in folders. Bookmarks created with Kuunga will be on browser too, so they will be editable too with the Google Chrome™ usual tools.\n\n- Yes, but I'm used to have more options in there...\n\nOf course you are! Bookmarks are just the first item of Kuunga for Google Chrome™! You can find 3 other tabs in the extension: Apps, Recent, Other.\n\nApps: There you will find all your installed apps where you willbe ableto execute them or delete them.\n\nRecent: This tab includes the most useful feature from the original \"new tab\" screen: most visited sites, and a little bit of navigation history.\n\nOther: This tab is used to display all the extra links that are not in the right format to be included in the post wall, so you will be able to use them as well.\n\n\nSo: user friendly display, more navigation options closer, style help and  new exclusive features. This ecuation results in a faster and more productive navigation journey.\n\n\n\nCAUTION: Kuunga is very addictive,once you get use to it, you will not be able to surf without it!"
