The extension adds a browser button that gives you access to our database at the touch of a button. An indicator shows whenever a paper you are currently researching (i.e. in your browser window) has a review in our database.\n\nIn 2011, researchers at Amgen attempted to replicate 53 studies that they considered landmarks in the basic science of cancer, often cooperating closely with the original researchers to ensure methodological consistency.\n\nThey were able to reproduce the original results in just *six*.\n\nLack of reproducibility in the scientific literature is a major problem; slowing down the quality and speed of scientific research and progress. SciBase helps address this problem by providing and independent, third-party platform for crowdsourced reviews from scientists who have tried to replicate the results  in the literature, along with their findings and suggestions for improvements."
