The daily image is the Bing Daily Wallpaper, if you don't like it, you can change the image to something from the secondary source (unsplash).\n\nNOTE: It may take up to 48 hours for the daily sync to start working (it should usually work instantly). \n\nThis is the first extension I have made, so there may be a few bugs.\nComing up:\n - More Sites supported (Youtube, Amazon)\n\nPlease leave a review if you like it, it means a lot to me. :)"
