It also comes with an “Autofocus” feature which allows you to access the search bar automatically without pressing any shortcuts. Simply activate it for websites where you do a lot of searching like Amazon or online dictionaries. Whenever you load a website that has “Autofocus” enabled or when you switch to it from another tab, you’ll find that the cursor is already in the search bar ready for you to start typing. \nThe extension is completely free and open-source which means, no tracking or data collection. No ads!\nAfter installation, make sure to reload/refresh all open tabs before using the extension!\nFeel free to suggest new features, report bugs, and so on at:\nhttps://github.com/gignupg/Search-Box-Focus\n\nCredits: \n“Search Box Focus” mainly uses the search box detection code of this Github repository:\nhttps://github.com/CodeRevver/Focus-First-Input \nThe extension icon can be found at:\nhttps://icons8.com/icon/48167/google-web-search"
