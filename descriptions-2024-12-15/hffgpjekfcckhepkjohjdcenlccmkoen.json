The extension listens for keypress updates to the specific HEP assignment field and sends the text value to a Physitrack endpoint along with the necessary authentication tokens to look up relevant exercises based on the keyword. The Physitrack endpoint response is then shown in a dropdown that makes it easy for the user to select the specific exercise they would like to assign with a click.\n\nIf a note is updated, the extension will also give the user the option to automatically sync it with Physitrack, generating a new Physitrack program assigned to the patient based on the content of the IntakeQ note."
