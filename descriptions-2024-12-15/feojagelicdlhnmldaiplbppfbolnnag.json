See our community curated collections of lenses at https://bazaar.insight.so/#desktop \n\nOPEN SOURCE AND PRIVATE: Hyperweb never sends any of your data to servers. It is also 100% open source. \n\nTRUSTED SOURCES: Mark sites you trust to have them feature more prominently in future searches and create a filter that searches only sources you trust.\n\nMUTING: Hide results from sites you don't like in future searches.\n\nFOR GROUPS: Companies and organizations can use Hyperweb together and share filters, blocklists and trusted site lists.\n\nâ€”\n\nhttps://github.com/abhinavsharma/hypersearch"
