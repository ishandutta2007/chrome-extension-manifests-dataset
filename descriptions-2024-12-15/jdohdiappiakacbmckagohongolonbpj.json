For full transparency, we have listed permissions we require and the corresponding data collected below:\n\nBrowser Tabs\n * When you add an item to your MyUS shopping cart, we sync that data across each of the browser tabs on which the MyUS Shopping extension is active. We require permission from each of your open tabs to do this, however, we do not collect any data on the tabs you have open.\n\nStorage\n* Items you add to your MyUS Shopping cart are saved in Chrome. Permission is required to store this product data so that you may access the items in your cart later.\n\nBroad Hosts\n* We require permission to all HTTP or HTTPS websites in order to read product data so we can add items to your MyUS shopping cart. However, we ONLY collect any data on these sites if you choose to add an item to your MyUS shopping cart. The data we collect includes URL, product title, merchant name and price. This data is not sold or shared externally."
