Opening them in another window feels clunky, and syncing with the Blockchain can take a day. SpareCoins is in your browser and can be opened with one click, or Ctrl+Shift+K. This makes sending Bitcoins around the web much easier.\n\n=== **Security** ===\n\nEvery week, another online Bitcoin Wallet gets hacked. SpareCoins, however, does not have a central point for attackers to target. Your private keys are encrypted and stored inside your browser, rather than an unsafe remote server. Your private keys can be backed up at anytime, and clearing your cache won’t delete your keys.\n\n=== **Open Source** ===\n\nSpareCoins is an Open Source project and holds true to the philosophy of Bitcoin through decentralizing online wallets whilst maintaining convenience. The ultimate vision is to facilitate transactions that were previously impossible, such as the ANYONECANPAY and MULTISIG protocols. We welcome developers to fork the repo on Github. The app is built on top of AngularJS and Bitcoinjs-lib."
