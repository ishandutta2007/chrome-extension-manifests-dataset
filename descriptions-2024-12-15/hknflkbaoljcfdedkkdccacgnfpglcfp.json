Save yourself from having to click on the language switcher every time.\n\nBy default Apple's docs open up for the Swift programming language. The website used to remember if you've changed the language to Objective-C from the language picker. However, this feature seems to be broken or removed. This extension aims to provide a solution to this problem. When you click on the extension button or you visit the options of the extension you can choose which language to be the default one or outright disable the functionality.\nSince this extension is aimed at Objective-C developers the default settings of the extension are Objective-C for language and enabled to get started as quickly as possible.\nThis extension can also help in case you're frequently visiting links that are for the Objective-C language. Just change the default language to Swift and it will detect and block Objective-C links as soon as you click on them resulting in a redirect to the Swift docs.\nBecause of the way the Apple developer docs were built and the simplicity of this extension it only works when directly visiting developer.apple.com such as from a web search or typing in the URL. developer.apple.com is a single page application meaning that when you're on the website the whole site doesn't reload when you click on a link. That means that if you choose a different language from the language picker it will keep using this language until you exit the website or refresh the page. This extension doesn't detect if you changed the language from the website which means that when you click to open a link in a new tab it will revert back to the default language from the extension settings.\nDocumentation that is only available in Swift will still be available.\n\nThis extension is open source. Click on the website link on the right to view the source code. Any contributions are welcome!\n\nThis extension works only on https://developer.apple.com/documentation/"
