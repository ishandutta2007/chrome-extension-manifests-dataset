The European Union too, but they want to make sure everyone consents to cookies, and consents, and consents, and consents.... until the internet is barely usable. That's when Cookie Monster comes into play. In a quest to make sure it gets to eat more cookies than anyone else, Cookie Monster will eat up those consent dialogs. And without consent, there won't be any advertisers cookies for you (but more for Cookie Monster, yummy!).\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Which browsers are supported?\nRight now this is published as a Chrome Extension in the Chrome Web Store. A Safari version is planned in the future.\n\n## Ok, but what does it really do?\nCookie Monster works a bit like an ad blocker but instead of ads it blocks cookie consent dialogs.\n\n## How can I help?\nSubmit pages that still have cookie consent dialogs here: https://github.com/zoellner/cookie-monster/issues\n\n## How can I contribute even more?\nYou can donate to the development of this browser extension here: https://github.com/sponsors/zoellner"
