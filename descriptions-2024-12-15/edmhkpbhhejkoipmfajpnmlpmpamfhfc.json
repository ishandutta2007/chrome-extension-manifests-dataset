At the moment extension is free to use and is in first stage. All that needs to be done is to be on tab where site or application is located, take design image (png or jpg format) and upload it to the extension. After clicking preview image design will be shown over design implementation and you will be able to see if it is accurate or not, and what are deviations. One note as it is first version it only works on screen sizes for which design is made (i.e. if design is made for screen width of 1920px when testing it application needs to be opened in that dimensions, use responsive view if screen size doesn't fit design width), on next versions there will be work in adjusting those things to be more fluid."
