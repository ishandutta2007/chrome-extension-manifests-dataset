You can add query parameters' keys and values, save them, and add or remove them from your current tab's URL with a click.\n\nLet's say you are working on a website or web app and you are using the query parameters \"mock=true\" to render mock data for development or \"user=123\" to test a specific page view. Adding it manually each time can be a pain, especially if you have to do it for multiple URLs.\n\nThis extension allows you to create query parameters and add them to your URL with a click.\n\nClick on the checkbox, then the respective query parameter is added to your current tab's URL. Click on it again, then it will be removed.\n\nYou will find it extremely useful as Tiny Tags recognizes what query parameters are in your current tab's URL, so you can save time from manually typing them every time, stay organized with a list of your most used query parameters, and most importantly, focus on your task."
