You might want to do it to find a key that works better with your voice, or simply to choose a version of the song that has chords that are easier for you to play.\n\nCurrently, it only works on websites with Italian chords (Do, Re, Mi etc..) and converts them into English chords so that transposition is possible. Inspired by the \"transpose\" functionality on the Ultimate Guitar website.\n\nTested on these websites:\n\nhttp://www.mbutozone.it\nhttp://psicoaccordi.blogspot.it\n\nHow to use:\n- Visit a web page that contains chords\n- Wait for the page to load and click on the extension icon in the top right of the browser\n- Click 'select chords' and then click on the lyrics on the web page\n- Click on the extension icon and click 'enable'. This will convert the chords to links\n- Click on the extension icon and click '+' or '-' to transpose\n- Click on a converted chord to remove (in case part of the lyrics were converted by mistake)"
