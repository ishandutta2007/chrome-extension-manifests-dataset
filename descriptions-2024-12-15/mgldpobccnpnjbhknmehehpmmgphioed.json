Since this was inspired by a promotional tweet for Inside Out 2, this notation could be referred to as the Inside Out Notation. The extension will only replace text on applicable Fighting Game Databases (at the time of launch, only Dustloop is supported). Additionally, the extension will only replace these numerals when they are plaintext, and should preserve any formatting native to the text on the website.\n\n1=Joy, 2=Anger, 3=Sadness, 4= Ennui, 5=Disgust, 6=Fear, 7=Anxiety, 8=Envy, 9=Embarrassment."
