They usually have a \"email me when this is back in stock\" option, but we don't always check our email regularly, so sometimes we miss it :'( So, I created this plugin, which lets you know within 30 seconds of a product coming back in stock right in your browser. It works like this...\n\n1.) Go to the page of a product you like, for example, http://www.sephora.com/everlasting-love-liquid-lipstick-P384954?skuId=1552413, which is currently out of stock at the time I'm writing this.\n\n2.) Click on the extension icon and press the \"Keep an eye on this\" button, and do this for as many products as you want to keep an eye on from Sephora's website (not the mobile site), or MakeupGeek's website.\n\n3.) Every 30 seconds the extension checks (in the background) on every product on the list to see if it is in stock, and if it is, the icon gets the word \"New\" on it.\n\n4.) Spend money on awesome products that are In Stock ;)\n\nI hope you enjoy this and it makes your makeup buying a little more productive. \n\nIf you like it, follow me on Tumblr.
