Although it may be cheap, spending money on a 10-game bundle where you already owned 9 of the games always makes me frustrated, so I created this extension!  This will gray-out any game you own on Steam that is on any of the weekly bundles, store pages, and keys to let you know if you own the game or not.  Additionally, it will highlight wishlisted games you may have forgotten about so you don't miss a great deal on a wanted game!\n\nHOW TO USE:\nThere will be a new extension icon in Chrome.  Click on that to input your 64bit SteamID or steam profile name (NOT nickname) if you have set your URL.  Click \"Save\" and you're done!  This information can be found in your profile URL \"steamcommunity.com/id/XXXXXXXXXX/\" or \"steamcommunity.com/profiles/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/\"\n\nNOTE:\nHumble Bundle uses a different naming format than Steam does for some games, but I will try to keep the alias file as up to date as possible whenever new bundles come out or new games are added to a bundle.  If you see that games aren't showing up in a bundle, don't hesitate to contact me!  The extension currently doesn't support steam DLC collections (Season Pass, Master Collection, Collector's Edition, etc.).\n\nVERSION 1.0 CHANGES:\n   * Manifest V3 update\n   * Changed how styles are applied for easier maintenance\n\nVERSION 0.9 CHANGES:\n   * Added support for the Humble Choice subscription page\n   * Fixed game aliases not loading in some circumstances\n\nVERSION 0.8 CHANGES:\n   * Added support for the Humble Bundle Store and Search pages\n   * Fixed for new Humble Bundle keys layout\n   * Fixed single quote in game title issues\n\nCONTACT ME:\nhttps://twitter.com/Zortrox"
