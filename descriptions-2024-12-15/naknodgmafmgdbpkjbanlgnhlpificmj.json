The extension intelligently records and organises your testing sessions. With SpiraCapture, you can:\nCapture your activity and take notes or screenshots about what happened\nWhen recording, capture clicks, keystrokes, URL changes, and network errors\nLimit recording only to the browser tabs you choose\nSimplify communication with your team.\n\nSpiraCapture is free and does not need to connect to any other software. \n\nYou can get even more out of SpiraCapture when you connect it to other Inflectra products: SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, or SpiraPlan (versions 6.1+). The built-in preview option makes communication with the rest of your team easy. Choose exactly what actions you want to share, and when connected to SpiraTest, create bugs in the right product fast. \n\nIf you donâ€™t have SpiraTest, you can copy and paste the HTML preview into whatever application you want. The data never leaves Chrome, and no sign up to any account with Inflectra is needed."
