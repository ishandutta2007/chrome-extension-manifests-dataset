Then, you don't risk accidentally seeing the GM's notes when you join a game where you rotate between being a GM and a player!\n\nIf you want to switch to GM mode, you can do so once you've entered the game, and the extension will not redirect you.\n\nThe code for this extension is available on GitHub.
