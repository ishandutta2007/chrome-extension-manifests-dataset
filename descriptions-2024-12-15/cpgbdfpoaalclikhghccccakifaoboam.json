Requests are smaller, and the homepage will not direct you to specific genre pages rather than load all the movies at once. On the bright side, it should load much faster.\n0.0.2 update: options page! Choose which features to use, and what ratings to hide.\n\nThis extension is not affiliated with Netflix."
