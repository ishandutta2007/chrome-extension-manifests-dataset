Once installed, there is nothing left for you to do.   \n\nRandaAwake includes two types of notifications: \n\n\t• A sunny RandoWhale right when it wakes up that will display its current voting power and current rate \n\t• A night-time RandoWhale when it is sleeping which also includes its current voting power\n\nThe frequency at which the extensions checks the status of @RandoWhale can be adjusted in your settings, at default it will check ever 15 minutes.  The sound that accompanies your notification can also be adjusted. \n\n\nQuestions or Feedback? \n\nSteemit.chat: @randowhale\nEmail: randowhale@gmail.com"
