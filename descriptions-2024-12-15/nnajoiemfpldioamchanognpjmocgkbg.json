It's like going back in time to look over your own shoulder as you write. \n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nI designed the extension to be as careful as possible about user privacy. No data is collected by me. User data is stored locally on the user's computer and it is only stored/collected there so that future replays of an already-replayed document will go faster.\n\nIt's possible that Google itself collects some user data on every one of its extensions, in which case Draftback wouldn't be an exception.\n\nOTHER NOTES\n\n- With Draftback, your data is kept entirely private. Draftback was purposely designed so that you could play back your own docs without having to share them with a third party. This is -your- data; Draftback just lets you see it in a new way.\n\n- Draftback only needs access to docs.google.com to get the revision data for playbackâ€”but that data never leaves your own browser.\n\n- Draftback has been tested with large documents, but you may run into trouble with REALLY large docs. If that happens, shoot me a note (me@jsomers.net) and I'll try to get to the bottom of it."
