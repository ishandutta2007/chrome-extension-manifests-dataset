Unfortunately, however, most people do not realize it until they suffer neck pain.\n\nIf you spend a lot of time sitting in front of your computer, you probably need to improve your neck / spine health condition. 30s Neck Stretch can help you by reminding you regularly of stretching your neck. Simple actions can make a big difference!\n\nAfter installing 30s Neck Stretch, a notification will pop up every 45 minutes (by default) to remind you that it's your neck time. When you click \"Let's do it\", a timer will count for 30 seconds as you stretch your neck.\n\n\nBrought to you with love by Ivy Guo and Scott Cheng.\n\nIvy says: \"30s Neck Stretch is part of my homework for one of my classes at Stanford. My goal is to help improve desk health by making use of information technologies. I would be very happy to hear your opinion and suggestions!\"\n\n\nLicense\n----\n\nThe code is licensed under the MIT license.\nhttps://github.com/scottcheng/neck-stretch"
