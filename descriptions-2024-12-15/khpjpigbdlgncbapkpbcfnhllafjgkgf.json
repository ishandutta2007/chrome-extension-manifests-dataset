These stories are chosen at random from /newest and get re-chosen every fifteen minutes. You can upvote them from the front page just like you would from /newest.\n\n(The highlight in the screenshot is edited to draw attention to the new story; this extension doesn't change how HN is styled.)\n\nDonations: 1KZ23Sm35C7Xjk9kV2VxCM7xscnsU9Huha\n\nExplanation of permissions:\n\nHost permissions: hacker-news.firebaseio.com and news.ycombinator.com. The first host is required to access the HN api and fetch new stories. The second host is required to display new stories on the front page.\n\nalarms: Required to trigger the periodic fetching of new stories.\n\nstorage: Required to persist data for new stories after we fetch them, so that displaying them on the front page is snappy.\n\nI take privacy seriously and your data is never shared with anyone. The extension is open-source at https://github.com/folz/hackers-new so that you can verify this claim."
