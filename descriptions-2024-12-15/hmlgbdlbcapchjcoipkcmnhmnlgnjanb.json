Seamlessly incorporate fuzzy matching into your search experience on intra.42.fr, making the search process more flexible and forgiving.\n\nThis extension improves the existing search function on intra.42.fr by applying a fuzzy matching algorithm to your queries. With fuzzy matching, you don't need to type in exact search phrases to find what you're looking for. Instead, the algorithm considers approximate string matches, allowing for minor errors such as misspellings, transpositions, and incomplete phrases.\n\nDisclaimer :\nThis unofficial extension is in no way affiliated with, authorized, maintained, sponsored or endorsed by 42. This is an independent and unofficial Chrome extension made by a student from 42network."
