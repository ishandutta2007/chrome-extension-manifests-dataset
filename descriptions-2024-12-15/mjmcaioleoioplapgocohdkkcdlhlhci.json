To use Salt you'll have to sign out of both your Google Account and Chrome Profile to install it, then you can sign back into your Google Account.\n\nNote: Salt was designed with students' experience in mind so it may be a little off for staff (they are very welcome to give feedback so I can improve it for them!)"
