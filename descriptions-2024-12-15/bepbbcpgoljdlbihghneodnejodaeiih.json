While this innovation offers remarkable benefits like enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and offline functionality, it also introduces potential risks. AI Block is designed to mitigate these risks by providing users the power to control and block the use of the window.ai API in their browsers completely.\n\n🙋 Why AI Block? \nThe window.ai API, a powerful interface for on-device AI, has transformative potential. However, if misused, it could lead to several risks:\n\n🕵️ Privacy Concerns: \nDespite local processing, malicious scripts could leverage AI capabilities to analyze sensitive data without user consent.\n\n🙅‍♀️ Unauthorised Resource Use: \nAI models, particularly sophisticated ones like Gemini Nano, are resource-intensive. Malicious websites might exploit these AI capabilities, leading to significant performance degradation or battery drain.\n\n📊 Data Integrity Attacks: \nOn-device AI could be used to alter or fabricate content, potentially misleading users or manipulating information without their knowledge.\n\n👮 Security Vulnerabilities: \nAs with any new technology, the integration of AI into browsers can introduce new attack vectors for malicious entities.\n\n\nFeatures\n🫷Complete Blockage of window.ai: \nPrevent any access to or execution of the window.ai API, ensuring that no unwanted AI processes run in your browser.\n\n🛡️ Real-time Protection: AI Block actively monitors and blocks attempts to invoke window.ai, protecting your device from unauthorised use in real-time.\n\n🤖 Works Automatically: \nEasy to use, disable AI functionalities across all websites without lifting a finger. Just install!\n\n\nJoin the Responsible AI Usage Movement\nAI Block is not just a tool; it's a movement towards responsible AI usage in web technologies. By installing AI Block, you are taking a crucial step in safeguarding your digital environment from potential abuses of emerging AI integrations in browsers.\n\nInstallation and Setup\nEasy to install, AI Block integrates seamlessly with your Chrome browser. Get started in just a few clicks and take control of how AI is used in your browser.\n\nFeedback and Support\nYour feedback is invaluable in shaping the future of AI Block. Feel free to message the dev!\n\nDownload AI Block today and take control of AI in your browser!"
