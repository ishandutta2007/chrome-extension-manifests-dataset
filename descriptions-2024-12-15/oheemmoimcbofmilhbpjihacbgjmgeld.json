This extension allows school administrators and lab managers to track and report on the use of select web applications in the Chrome browser on school-owned computers and devices.  \n\nThe LabStats software provides a simple cloud-based solution for measuring technology usage in computer labs. Customizable reports make visualizing usage data quick and easy.\n\nDo you ever wonder which computers are being used the most/least?\nDo you think you may be paying for software licenses that arenâ€™t actually being used?\nDo you wish you could back up funding requests with hard numbers and prove that your hardware and software resources are being fully utilized?\nLabStats delivers the insights you need to cut excess spending and focus resources in the areas students need them most. Why make large investments in technology without a way to measure its effectiveness?\n\nFor more information about LabStats, please visit https://labstats.com.\nFor our privacy policy, please visit https://labstats.com/privacy."
