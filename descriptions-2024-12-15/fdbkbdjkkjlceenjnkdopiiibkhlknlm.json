Because: \n - It adds additional image comparer to the GitHub PR file preview that shows what pixels changed so you can easily spot the difference.\n - You can open original, changed and diff images in a preview dialog for better comparison.\n - There is also settings menu that allows you to make this comparer as a default one and change the threshold.\n\nChangelog\n0.4.0 - 2022-05-01\n - 💄 Private repos support!\n - 🐛 Fixed images stretching in width.\n - 🐛 Fixed page changes detection in order to show diffs when page changes.\n\n0.3.0 - 2022-04-27\n - 💄 Using `IntersectionObserver` to only load images when they are almost in the viewport\n - 🐛 Doing nothing in private repos as we don't know how to handle them\n\n0.2.1 - 2022-04-18\n - 🐛 Showing diffs in any commit inside PR.\n - 🐛 Making the extension work with most popular images extensions.\n\n0.2.0 - 2022-04-18\n - 💄 Showing diff images for between changes inside the PR.\n - 💄 Added dialog animation."
