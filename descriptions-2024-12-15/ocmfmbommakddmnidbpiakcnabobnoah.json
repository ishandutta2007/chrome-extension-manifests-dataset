However, since the calculator detects leap-years, it will always be accurate.\n\nSee the link below for date comparisons between the original PDF and the dates given by the calculator.\nhttps://emdixonroche.com/projects/CaseStudies/PerpetualCalendarCaseStudy/Images/DepoProvera_Comparisson_Calendar.pdf"
