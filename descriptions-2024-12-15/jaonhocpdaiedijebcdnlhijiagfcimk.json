But one can want to easily see which image has a correct alt attribute, for testing or debugging purposes, or just to see how thses alt attributes are used by others (And also _if_ they are used by others).\n\nWhen installed, the extension will look for the page's source code, and duplicate the alt attribute into the element's title attribute, thus allowing to see the content by hovering the cursor on said element.\n\nChangelog:\n\nV1. Initial upload, works only with images (img tags). The script also looks for DOM changes, so if new images are loaded, their alt attributes are managed as well."
