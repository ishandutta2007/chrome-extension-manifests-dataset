It shouldn't cause problems, but I can't make any guarantees. It's wise to keep critical notes backed up.\n * This extension only works with the website version of Google Keep (eg. https://keep.google.com/keep/) - it won't work with the \"app\" version (the one you might install and launch from your app menu -ie. for offline use).\n * At this time, clicking the extension icon itself does not toggle anything - click the full-screen icon added to the note itself (or use the keyboard shortcut) to toggle full-screen on and off.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n * Full-screen is enabled by default when you first install the extension.\n * Use the full-screen icon at the bottom of the note to toggle full-screen on and off as needed.\n * Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut, which you can customize at \n\"chrome://extensions/shortcuts\"\n * Your selection will be remembered between notes and sessions.\n * Open the extension options (from a note menu, Keep menu, extension icon menu or extension page) to customize behavior.\n\nLike the Extension?\nRate or review it here to help others find it: https://cmp.onl/tnEd\n\nFound a bug?
