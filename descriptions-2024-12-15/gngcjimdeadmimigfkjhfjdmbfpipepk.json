It is not meant to be a replacement, since I enjoy building that site (and the extension is also using the same APIs)\n\nDisclaimer about privacy:\nThe code contains no tracker whatsoever.\n\nThe full source code can be found here: https://gitlab.com/secondstatebuilds/burnextension\n\nMassive thanks to the Pak community for the motivation, and love, and thanks to Dude23 on Discord for the idea!\n\nAlso huge thanks goes out to Philippe, the creator of: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/ethereum-gas-prices as I've used a fair chunk of his code to make this happen in day or so."
