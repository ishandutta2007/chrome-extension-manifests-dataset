And since Amazon removed the Order History Report (March 20, 2023) option, it's now even harder. This extension will itemize your Amazon purchases so you can know how much money you're actually spending in your respective categories, rather than just lumping everything from Amazon in \"misc.\"\n\nTo run the Amazon Transaction Itemizer, press cmd+i on Mac or ctrl+i on Windows (or click the extension icon in your toolbar) on any page in Chrome. This will automatically open your Amazon transactions page in a new tab and itemize your transactions!\n\nIn order to see transactions on a previous page, please update the extension settings to be \"Amazon Only\" using the following instructions:\n\n1. Right click on the extension icon if it's in your toolbar or click the three dots to the right of the icon if it's in the extension dropdown menu\n2. Select \"Options\"\n3. On the page that pops up, select \"Amazon Only.\""
