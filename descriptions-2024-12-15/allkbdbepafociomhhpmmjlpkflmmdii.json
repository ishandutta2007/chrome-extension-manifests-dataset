This extension provides useful search options that can be entered with 1 click rather than retyping them, or if you are like most people, googling how to use them over and over. The idea is to make more difficult search queries easy and more accessible.\n\nAll feedback welcome! I'd love to know how this is being used and if there are any additional features people would like."
