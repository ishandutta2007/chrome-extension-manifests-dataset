The tooling provided creates a new Chrome Devtools panel, which allows a quick look at the custom elements on the current page, and enables modification of  attributes and properties of said components.\n\nWeb Component DevTools utilizes the Custom Elements Manifest (https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest) to analyze the Web Components.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nWeb Component DevTools provides advanced features to the developer, straight from the browser's UI to, for example:\n\n- Listing custom elements on the page, and accessible iframes inside the page\n- Filtering custom elements on the list\n- Inspecting and modifying the attributes of custom elements\n- Inspecting and modifying the properties (even objects and arrays) of custom elements\n- Observing dispatched events\n- Calling functions of the custom element, and logging the return values\n- View the source code of web components on page\n- Interact directly with web components through the console\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\nIn the process of developing Web Components, wether it be with a library like Lit, or without any kind of library, there comes situtations in which you might want to have a bit more control over your components than what the regular browser devtools gives you.\n\nYou might for example want to:\n\nToggle the Attributes of the element\nToggle the Properties of the element\nMonitor when events get dispatched from the element\nCall functions\nAnd when you're working with Web Components, Shadow DOM usually is present, making it fairly difficult to find the path to the element. And even if you got the path, having to write document.querySelector(\"my-selector-string > element-name\").setAttribute(\"my-attr\", \"foo\") every time you want to modify a value is quite cumbersome.\n\nFor this use case the Web Components DevTools were created: To enable the developer to easily modify the attributes, properties and therefore state of their element straight from the devtools window with the click of a button.\n\n\n\n\nIssues:\n\nAny issues you run into while using the DevTools should be submitted to the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/Matsuuu/web-component-devtools/issues)."
