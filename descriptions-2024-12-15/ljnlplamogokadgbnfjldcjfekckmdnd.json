It's a convenient tool for preserving a website's state post-login, enabling easy restoration after the browser refreshes or switches to a new profile. Additionally, the encrypted data can restore the state of a PWA application.\n\nFeatures:\n- The extension offers storage options in the browser's synced storage or local files.\n- Uses SHA256 encryption to secure the stored data.\n- For security purposes, if the password is forgotten, data recovery is impossible.\n- Note that the success of restoration depends on the type of storage the website employs for local data. Testing restoration in a clean profile ensures the site's recoverability.\n\nHow to Use:\nTo back up a website, open it in a browser tab, proceed with login, and access the action button (which might be hidden in the extensions bar). Set and confirm a password, then click the backup button. The file, saved in \".enc\" format, will be stored in your browser's default download directory.\n\nFor recovery, open the same website in a new browser or profile. Click the action button to access the interface, then select the recover option and browse for the \"*.enc\" file. The extension restores all cookies and local storage data and provides the option to redirect the page to its state at the time of backup. If you have been redirected to the login page, permit this action.\n\nPrivacy:\nThis extension operates entirely offline, ensuring that no data is sent or received from any server whatsoever."
