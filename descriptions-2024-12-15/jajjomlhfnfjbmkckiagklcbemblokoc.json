If you don't want people to have your phone number, simply put the Service Desks own extension 65515.\n\n•Before submitting, click the plugin icon in the toolbar and proceed by clicking the \"Generate\" button. This will create the new URL and place it into the Generated URL box. To copy the URL, simply press the Copy URL button. You will see a message appear on screen if this was successful.\n\n•(optional) Click \"Shorten Url\" to create a short version of the url using the Google Url Shortener and send that link to people.\n\nHow it works:\n\nHow this works is it stores the html form ID and value within the URL. This is done by using a hash at the end of the URL and using the format of <formID>=<formValue>& for each entry that needs to be filled on the webpage.\n\nThis process can be used on any site that doesn't already use a hash in the URL. The \"Insert URL Values\" is for this purpose and can be used on other pages of your choosing. Simply suffix the URL you usually use to access with a # followed by the form ID on the page, an equals and then the value. If you wish to include multiple entries, use & to join these together.\n\n***CHANGE LOG***\nVersion 1.9:\n•Corrected broken syntax. Don't know how that managed to get through!\n\nVersion 1.8:\n•Fixed issue with room name and asset number were not sending.\n\nVersion 1.7:\n•Fixed manifest.json error. Should download now.\n\nVersion 1.6:\n•Cleaned up code and added comments to the js\n•Added an info button linking to the GitHub page to help with how to use the program\n\nVersion 1.5:\n•Included Google URL Shortener API to shorten urls without leaving the extension\n•Improved UI design\n•Improved Error messaging\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/JFDesigner/FastSNOW"
