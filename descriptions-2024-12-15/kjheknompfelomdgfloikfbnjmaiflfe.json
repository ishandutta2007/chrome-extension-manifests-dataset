Any page refresh will bring back the full page as intended. To automatically hide elements when loading a page please try the ‘Automatic Hiding’ feature on the Options page.\n- Once the extension is added to Chrome, any pages you already have open will need to be refreshed for the extension to start working.\n- The icon menu for chrome extensions should display to the right of the address bar (a puzzle piece).\n\n\n-- UPDATE NOTES --\n\n3.7.0 (13th April 2024):\n- Added ability to close “about:blank” popups when opened from a specified website.\n- Displays “unsaved changes” warning message on the Options page.\n\n3.6.0 (14th April 2023):\n- Migrated to new Chrome extension manifest version 3.\n\n3.5.0 (18th November 2022):\n- Added \"Show Auto Hidden\" button in the icon menu to redisplay automatically hidden elements.\n- Added \"Rerun Auto Hide\" button in the icon menu to rerun automatic hiding.\n\n3.4.0 (8th September 2022):\n- Added a user-friend option for the Automatic Hiding feature in the icon menu (“Set Auto Hide”) which will automatically generate the necessary element selectors for all your hidden elements on the current page.\n- Set newly added items as green, to indicate they are unsaved.\n\n3.3 (21st March 2021):\n- Switched to using Chrome's local storage for storing the settings data (instead of syncing the data to your Google account). This allows for a higher data storage limit.\n\n3.2 (31st December 2020):\n- Allow user to disable/enable individual automatically hidden sites or elements.\n\n3.1 (22nd December 2020):\n- General improvements and bug fixes\n- Added option to show/hide help text on the Options page.\n\n3.0 (29th November 2020):\n- Added new ‘Automatic Hiding’ feature on the Options page.\n- Split the ‘Advanced Features’ section on the Options page into the ‘Automatic Closing’ section and the new ‘Automatic Hiding’ section.\n- Improved help text and advanced feature explanations.\n- I apologise if any of your Option settings for this extension were reset upon upgrading to version 3.0.\n\n2.2 (6th September 2020):\n- Added new 'Export Settings' section to the Options page. This will allow a user to import/export their settings.\n\n2.1 (9th January 2020):\n- Enhanced the 'Advanced Features' option that closes listed popup sites. There is now a dropdown list that displays the address of recent new tabs or popups. This means the user doesn't have to manually capture the initial address of the popup site.\n\n2.0 (December 2019):\n- Added new 'Advanced Features' section to the Options page.\n- Added 'Advanced Features' option that can immediately close listed popup sites."
