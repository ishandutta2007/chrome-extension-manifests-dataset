This is exactly what HangBot solves. With this new tool, you can specify the start time, and end time, of your daily hangout, and it will start it for you! You also have options like 'Auto Join', 'Disable Camera', or 'Disable Mic', to allow you to specify exactly how you want your daily hangout to load. More things to come!\n\nVersion 1.0.3 Updates:\n\n- Fixes bug with double hangouts opening.\n- Now checks if hangout is in between times specified, also checks if the tab is open, and if not, it opens it.\n- A lot of backend updates."
