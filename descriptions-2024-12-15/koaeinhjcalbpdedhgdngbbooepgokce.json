In this dynamic environment, traditional “perimeter-and-policy” tools are a security professional’s nightmare. We need a new way – or protecting the cloud will become a life sentence of rule development, event correlation, and catch up.\nLacework approaches cloud workload security from a completely new direction. We realized that every datacenter, every workload, every user, every container, and every process has its own truth. And any departure from that truth signals a potential attack. Inspired by this insight, we spent the last two years creating the industry’s first zero-touch cloud workload security solution that make breach detection, insider threat management, incident investigations, and DevSecOps insights dramatically more effective, while reducing time to detection, false positives, and time to remediation.\n\nLacework Polygraph tells the story of every breach – when it happened, how it worked, and what was hit – so you can stop it, fix it, and move on. All without rules, policies, or logs."
