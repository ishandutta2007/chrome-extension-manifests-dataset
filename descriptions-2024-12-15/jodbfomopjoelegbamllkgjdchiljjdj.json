Google Message Encryption and GAME) offers policy-based email encryption and email data loss prevention to make securing your sensitive email communication easy. ZixEncrypt scans the content of all your outbound email and automatically encrypts or quarantines based on policies you define. It automatically ensures compliance of your email communication without requiring special training or procedures for your employees. \n\nPolicy-based Email Encryption\nZixEncrypt provides robust filtering technology that enables you to define and manage policy rules for protecting sensitive email content and ensuring compliance. Pre-defined industry filters are available for healthcare, financial, state privacy, education and more. Based on the email content you can determine if the email should be blocked, routed, quarantined or encrypted.\n\nBi-Directional Transparent Delivery\nJust as ZixEncrypt automatically scans your email, it also automatically determines the most efficient way to securely deliver your messages using our patented Best Method of DeliverySM. Through the Best Method of Delivery, encrypted email is delivered to anyone, anywhere and often transparently.\n\nZix offers the industry’s only bidirectional transparent email encryption, enabling senders and recipients to exchange encrypted email without any extra steps. When you send an encrypted email to another Zix customer, the message and replies are encrypted transparently, so that not even a password is needed. On average, more than one-third of our customers’ recipients receive their encrypted email messages transparently.\n\nPolicy-Based TLS\nIf you have ever tried to use TLS to secure email communication with partners, you are probably familiar with the manual effort required to securely configure and manage each TLS connection. ZixEncrypt simplifies the set up and management of TLS by making it a part of your email encryption policies. By including TLS in a policy, you increase control and reporting visibility on your TLS encrypted email. Additionally, if TLS is not available, you can configure ZixEncrypt to fallback to an alternative delivery method to ensure the email is still delivered securely.\n\nMobile Friendly Secure Portal\nWhen sending to recipients who do not have email encryption capabilities, ZixEncrypt offers a secure portal delivery that makes receiving an encrypted email easy, even on a mobile device. You can also brand and integrate the secure portal into your corporate portal. \n\nAll of these options combine to create the Zix Best Method of Delivery, which automatically determines the most secure and transparent method of sending your message.\n\nConvenient Data Loss Prevention\nZixEncrypt can also prevent the unauthorized sending of confidential information outside the organization. Based on policies, an email can be quarantine and a notification sent to the employee, employee’s manager and/or an administrator. Embedded in the notification is a link to review the quarantined email with highlighted violations. Depending on your preferences, employees and managers can release or delete the email. If released, the email can be encrypted based on a user trigger or your policies.\n\nAdditional Zix Solutions\n\nZixProtect – Advanced Email Threat Protection\nSophisticated attacks demand a sophisticated solution. With a multi-layer approach and live email security experts, ZixProtect takes out the guess work with protection from ransomware, malware, spear phishing, and more to keep your email, employees, and business safe from the latest threats.\n\nZixArchive – Business Communication Archiving\nEmployees communicate electronically over email, instant messaging, social media and more. Meeting regulatory and legal requirements to archive all digital business communications is overwhelming, and conducting eDiscovery across multiple communication channels can be a headache. ZixArchive provides secure email retention of digital business communication and makes compliance and eDiscovery easier for you and your team."
