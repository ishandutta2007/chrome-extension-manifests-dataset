Requires a backend component, see https://github.com/robbiev/multipass-chrome for instructions. You will obviously also want to use 1Password on another platform which you can purchase at https://agilebits.com/onepassword\n\nThis extension is for people who love 1Password on Mac but also use Linux, which it does not support at the moment.\n\nNote that currently only the agile keychain format is supported.\n\nThis extension may or may not work for you. If anything goes wrong with your computer or your data I am not responsible. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\nThat said, the full source code is available and you are welcome to suggest or contribute improvements."
