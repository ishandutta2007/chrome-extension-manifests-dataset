Our latest version allows you to spend your BTC at Amazon as well.\n\nWe compare prices of items you are currently shopping for with major retailers' prices such as Amazon to ensure that you are not only getting the best price but that you don't need to go through more hassle than you need to to shop online.\n\nPricely promises to never bother you with annoying offers or popups unless it detects that you can save money and time by just going to a major retailer. Other than that, it'll always be waiting for you to click on it for a price check!\n\nUnlike many other price comparisons that rely on shopping site aggregators, we manually add support for each shopping site to the extension to ensure that we can you with the optimal user experience.
