Based on /r/minimalism's subreddit style, redd.AT provides a clean and unified experience that preserves reddit's core philosophy of content above all else.\n\nredd.AT is compatible with RES (reddit Enhancement Suite), but works with plain-ol' reddit just as well.\n\n~ Tips ~\nFor the best experience, please install Open Sans on your computer:\nhttp://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans\n\n~ Nota Bene ~\nThis message indicates that redd.AT is in public beta.  I originally created redd.AT for personal use, but due to popular demand I've decided to increase its availability.  It's stable and secure, but I make no guarantees (implied or explicit) that the extension is completely bug-free.\n\nIf you encounter a bug, glitch, or otherwise have feedback about redd.AT, please consider leaving a review or contacting me via redbanhammer[at]gmail[.]com.  Thanks!"
