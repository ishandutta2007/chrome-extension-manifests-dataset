This extension opens as a new tab and gently pulls favorites and thumbnails from a subscription list that you build on the extension's UI.\n\nI consistently find many of my eventual favorite artists through the favorites of other users. FA seems to be designed for this kind of exploration, but not being able to subscribe to the favorites by themselves works against this otherwise excellent way to explore the content on the site.\n\nSee the source code at https://github.com/quizzl/fa-favs/tree/dev-chrome . Details about how this extension rate-limits itself and keeps your data personal untouched is also found in the GitHub README."
