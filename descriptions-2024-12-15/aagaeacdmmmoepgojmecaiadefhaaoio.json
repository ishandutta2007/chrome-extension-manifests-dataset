The extension retrieves data directly from the New Zealand Electricity Authority's publicly available API and presents it in a user-friendly table.\n\nThe extension features a simple user interface, with an input field for the user to enter their ICP number and a button to initiate the data retrieval process. Once the data has been retrieved, the results are displayed in an HTML table within the extension window. The user can then copy the table to the clipboard for easy sharing or exporting to another application.\n\nThe results table includes detailed information about the ICP, such as its status, trader, network, pricing, and address. The ICP status is mapped to its actual status, making it easy for the user to understand the current state of their ICP. The address is presented in a concatenated string format, which includes the physical address unit, number, street, suburb, town, and region. The pricing information includes details such as distributor price category code, chargeable capacity, distributor installation details, and distributor loss category code.\n\nThe extension also includes a copy button that enables the user to quickly and easily copy the HTML table to the clipboard. The button is only displayed when there are results to copy, ensuring that the user doesn't accidentally copy an empty table.\n\nICP Search is designed to be easy to use, even for users with limited technical knowledge. It requires no installation or configuration beyond the initial installation of the extension from the Chrome Web Store. The extension uses the Chrome browser's built-in security features to ensure that the user's data is protected at all times.\n\nICP Search is a valuable tool for New Zealand electricity network customers who need to quickly and easily retrieve details about their ICP numbers. It saves time and effort compared to manually retrieving data from the New Zealand Electricity Authority's website. The extension is ideal for home and business users who need to manage multiple ICPs, such as landlords, property managers, and facility managers. With its simple interface and powerful features, ICP Search is a must-have tool for anyone who needs to access ICP data quickly and easily."
