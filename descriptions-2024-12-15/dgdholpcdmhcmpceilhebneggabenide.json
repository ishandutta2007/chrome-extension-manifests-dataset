Now, I find that I have problems with Reddit Enhancement Suite using a high amount of CPU/memory, and craps out after about 3 pages of loaded content. So I made RELite. Think of it as an alternative to Reddit Enhancement Suite (though in no way affiliated with it) that uses a hell of a lot less CPU/memory. \n\nFrom benchmarking with 1000 items loaded, RELite used 43.6% less memory, and 34.1% less CPU than RES. \n\nThis extension does the following:\n\n    View images in-line\n    View gifs in-line\n    View YouTube videos in-line\n    View Imgur albums in-line\n    View reddit static/reddit images/reddit hosted images in-line (at the time of writing not supported by RES)\n    Use far less memory/CPU than Reddit Enhancement Suite\n    Resize all images/videos/gifs\n    Preload all the things!\n    Doesn't track you. Seriously, screw Reddit outbound link tracking.\n    Less permissions required (why do *some* apps require access to my full browsing history? This just accesses *.reddit.com, *.imgur.com, and *.gifycat.com)\n\n\nAny feature requests/bugs please send an email to reliteapp@gmail.com. Nb. disable RES to work properly. It is still being worked on, so any constructive criticism is seriously welcome. Thanks!"
