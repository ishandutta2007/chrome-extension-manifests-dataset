With automatic class gathering, cloud sync, and the ability to add/modify the classes being considered, this application will help you to know exactly where you stand BEFORE it becomes a problem.\n\nProspective classes added by you are synced across devices, and with the ability to filter for CBE or MSCM Foundation courses, you'll never have to guess at your GPA again."
