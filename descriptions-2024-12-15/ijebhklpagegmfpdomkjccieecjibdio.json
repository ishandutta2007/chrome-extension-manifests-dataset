This version lets you watch videos in full screen without cookies, ads, comments, or related video panels. Normally, you have to manually edit the URL to access this mode which is bulky. Also the ads free / no script  version has no functionality - like back buttons.  MajorGeeks yToggle makes it easy to switch between normal and ad-free mode with a single click allowing you to receive the benefits of both formats. For the best experience, pin it to your extension bar for quick access."
