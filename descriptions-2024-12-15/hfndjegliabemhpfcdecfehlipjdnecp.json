I noticed a number of other Chrome Extensions that were similar but they all only worked on the homepage, so I decided to make one that worked all over the site, and didn't need the mouse to scroll before it would activate.\n\nI spent a few days looking into how YouTube sets up the front-end of their website, so if anyone has any questions, feel free to shoot me a message. Also, if anyone would like to check out the source-code, or contribute to make it ever better (or fix bugs), check out the github page for this chrome extension : https://github.com/robertfrosty/shift-yt-optimizer ."
