Links to videos that already have subtitles ready, I will put in this description and will periodically update this list. \n\nAll you need to do to make subtitles appear is to install the extension and go to the videos from the list below. The subtitles will appear automatically. For convenience, disable the auto-generated YouTube subtitles, because they can overlap the subtitles generated by this extension.\n\nList of series here: https://slokerdev.com \nThe series will be updated as they are translated and added, so add this site to your bookmarks."
