Now you can see which friends removed you from their Insta following list.\n\nThis extension is a helper tool for Instagram that you can use for:\n– checking Instagram followers to follows dashboard for your social account\n– checking who doesn't follow you back in response\n– tracking new subscribers\n\nWarning:\n– we currently can not handle accounts with large amount of followers (around 3000+), process will stuck in the middle of the scan. Fixing this is a work in progress for the next versions\n– extension doesn't ask you for your login/password pair. It just utilizes your current browser session\n– no notification about new unfollow yet. Unfriend notify it also a feature in development\n\nHow this plugin exactly works:\n– it runs through your social graрh building clear dashboard of follows and followers data"
