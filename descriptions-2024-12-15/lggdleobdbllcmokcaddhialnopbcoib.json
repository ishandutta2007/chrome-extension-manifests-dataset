You'll find out the type of readers who are most likely to understand your text, including their grade level and age.\n\nThe extension adds a convenient button to the browser toolbar to go directly to the app as well as a right-click menu with three options.\n\nHighlight any online text, then right-click. You will see a context menu with 3 options:\n\nThe options are:\n\n1) Score Text Readability: automatically score the highlighted text and find out if your readers can read and understand the text.\n\n2) Robert Gunning Editor: automatically imports the text into our readability editor where you can edit for wordiness and complexity.\n\n3) Word Stats: automatically get text stats for the highlighted text."
