We all know that there are some strange items on AliExpress, the point of this game is that one person in a group of 3 or more people choses an item, the extension will automatically hide the price. The other people make their guess of what the price of the item will be based on the pictures and the title of the item. The person who gets closest to the real price wins.\n\nFor items that have a price range due to different models, the extension will take the cheapest option which is also the one that is displayed when searching for the item. This extension only works with the the US version of the website with  the USD currency. \n\nDisclaimer:\nThis extension will make you unable to purchase any items on AliExpress while this extension is active, if you would like to use AliExpress for its intended purpose and buy things from it you will either have to disable the extension or uninstall it. I will be working on an off button soon."
