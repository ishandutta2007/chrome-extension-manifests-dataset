As a JavaScript developer, I realized that I could use my skills to find a solution through coding.\n\nI'm sure many of you can relate to the difficulty of finding an available slot, especially with all the recent news. It's a frustrating process that requires endless hours of staring at a computer screen and hoping for the best.\n\nThat's why I came up with a solution: a Chrome extension that automatically refreshes the page and alerts you when a spot becomes available. Of course, you'll still need to act quickly to secure the booking, but I can personally guarantee that this method is more effective than spending three months manually searching for an opening."
