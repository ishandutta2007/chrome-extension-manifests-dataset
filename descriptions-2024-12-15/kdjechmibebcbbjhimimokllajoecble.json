The extension sits in the header of the browser.  Clicking on the extension creates a quote widget where you can enter the address to be quoted.  After the premium on the quote returns, you can email your customers the quote that was shown or you may continue to your screens in the Agent Web application to customize the quote. \nThe whole process can be completed within just a few seconds.  Try it now.   There are no costs or fees associated with this handy tool and the installation process is simple:  Select our extension in the Chrome Web Store and install.   The only thing you need to indicate – one time only – is your Producer Code for your Agency."
