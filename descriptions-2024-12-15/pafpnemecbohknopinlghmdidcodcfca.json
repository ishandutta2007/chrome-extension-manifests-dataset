As a beginner there's no need to learn openings 15 moves out because our opponents will most likely go out of book within the first handful of moves.  After adjusting the move depth to a more reasonable level I quickly learned that many of the variations in a given book were identical given my limited move depth.  This means I was stuck learning and reviewing the same opening variation over and over.  This extension will allow you to automatically collapse + pause variations that are identical given your current move depth."
