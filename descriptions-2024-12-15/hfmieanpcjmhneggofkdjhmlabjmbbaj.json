According to the book, one source of distraction are the external triggers that lead us to distracting activities and thus leave less time for things that we actually intend to do.\n\nYouTube is one such place for me on the internet where I often wander and get lost from the focus track that I plan to be on. No doubt YouTube is a great place to learn but it does have a lot of distracting content too. \n\nTaking cue from the book, we created YouTube Productivity Mode, with an objective to reduce the triggers. Switch YPM in “Productivity Mode” to blur all the thumbnails on YouTube so that the catchy and clickbaity thumbnails don’t grab your attention. So now if you get redirected to YouTube while working/studying, the recommended thumbnails won’t catch your eyes and you will hopefully switch back to your task again without losing your focus.\n\nBy default, YPM works on “Leisure Mode” where you’ll get the same experience of YouTube without annoying ads.\n\nWe are indie makers who believe that focus is a superpower. If this app helps you in any way, please help us too.
