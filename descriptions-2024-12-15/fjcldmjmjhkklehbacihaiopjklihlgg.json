Do you want your life back, but can't bear to delete social media altogether?\n\nThis is where News Feed Eradicator comes in.\n\nNews Feed Eradicator removes the most addicting part of Facebook, Twitter and other social networks - the feed - and replaces it instead with an inspirational quote. You can still use the other functionality as usual, you just won't get sucked into the attention hole.\n\nSee screenshots for supported websites.\n\n---------\n\n“It's easy to quit Facebook. I've done it hundreds of times.” ~ Mark Twain"
