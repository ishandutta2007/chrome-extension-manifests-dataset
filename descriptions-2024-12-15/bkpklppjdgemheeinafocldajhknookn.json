Some tweets might not be parsed properly due to utf-8 issues.\n\nSince it was made quick and I'm not the best dev out there,  there's many bugs.\nMost of it seems to work, if not on page refresh\n\nI haven't tested the extension with more than a thousand tweets, so there could be consequences to the performance once the db gets too large.\n*Especially there is no limit to the return results of the search, so if you search for keywords\nlike: likes, views, replies, a, ... would return you all the tweets which could potentially cause performance issues//\n\nYou might have to delete the db once in a while\nF12 ->Application->IndexedDB delete (twittermDB)"
