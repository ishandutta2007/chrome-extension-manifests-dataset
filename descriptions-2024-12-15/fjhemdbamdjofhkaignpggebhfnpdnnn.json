This app will show the time it will take you to earn the money to purchase an item you are viewing on amazon or ebay.  The time is calculated based on your annual salary or hourly wage.  For example, say you make $10.00 per hour and you are on an amazon page for an item that costs $100 dollars.  This chrome extension will show you how much time it will cost for you to purchase the item.  In this case, it would cost you 10 working hours!  Hopefully, this extension will help give you a different perspective on the value of your money."
