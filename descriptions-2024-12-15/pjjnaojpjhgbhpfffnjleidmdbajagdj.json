Dapplets are small augmenting applications developed and audited by the dapplet community. \n\nThe project Dapplets follows the ethics of free public blockchains where the development and audit is verifiable and provided by the open community. At the same time the User is free to select any Dapplets to run based on their audit status and maturity or disable them.\n\nDapplets require read and write permissions to any website to augment it. You can always either verify the source code or rely on the audit status set by auditors you trust.\n\nYou will find the source code of the DappletBridge on Github:\nhttps://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-extension"
