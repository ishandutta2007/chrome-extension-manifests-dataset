Once you're ready to go forward, simply click the forwards button in your browser.\n\nI made this super quickly when browsing a search engine and wanted to use the dedicated buttons on my mouse to go forward. At the moment, it supports a couple of the major search engines as well as most WordPress sites (and any site that uses URL parameters like ?page=1 or ?page=2).\n\nI've not attempted to work with continuous feed style sites, nor will this work on everything. Please leave feedback or contact directly with sites you'd like me to take a look at :)"
