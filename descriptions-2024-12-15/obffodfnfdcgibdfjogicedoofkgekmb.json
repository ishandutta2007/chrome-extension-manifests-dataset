After installing Chrome Extension, any PDF file opened in Chrome will have an Open With Edform button. By clicking the button, the file is immediately imported to the Edform, and you can continue working with it by creating an interactive worksheet.\n\nEdform is a learning platform that helps to transform existing educational materials into interactive, auto-graded, engaging activities. \n\nThe teacher can upload the document into the builder to modify it by adding different question types, video, and audio materials, combining with pages from another document. \n\nThen set the assignment in student-paced or live mode when the activity is ready to use, depending on the specific lesson objectives. Moreover, teachers can monitor students` progress, grade their work instantly and provide meaningful written, audio, or video feedback to improve students` knowledge. \n\nEdform allows users to integrate with tools they already use, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and One Drive, and share assignments in Google Classroom and other Learning Management Systems. \n\nThe platform's interactive features save teachers' time and increase students' productivity."
