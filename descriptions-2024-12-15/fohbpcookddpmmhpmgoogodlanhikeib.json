It encrypts all data locally on your device, meaning no data is sent to a remote server. To keep Workflowy's simplicity, the extension only provides minimal interfaces styled with Workflowy's native styling. While it is designed to be minimal and seamless from the user's perspective, it ensures that all text-based content sent to Workflowy servers is encrypted with AES standards so that your sensitive content can only be read by you.\n\n=> Getting Started\nAfter installing the extension, follow the steps below to get started:\n1. Visit workflowy.com and and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your encryption key.\n2. Add a #private tag to any node you want to secure. All sub-nodes of the selected node, including the ones you will add later, will be encrypted automatically.\nAnd that's it! Encrypted nodes will be readable only from web browsers that have WorkflowyEncrypter installed. Try to use a different device or disable the extension temporarily to see the magic!\n\n=> Data & Privacy\nWorkflowy Encrypter does not collect data from any user; there is not even a remote server dedicated to this extension. All processing is done locally on your device and shared with neither the developer nor any third parties.\n\n=> Contact\nHave something on your mind? For any questions, suggestions, or feedback, do not hesitate to shoot an email, drop a message on social media, open an issue on GitHub, or better yet, open a pull request if you are a developer. Contributions are much appreciated! Visit alpafyonluoglu.dev for communication details.\n\n=> Note\nWorkflowy Encrypter is an open-source third-party extension that is in beta period and under active development, meaning while it is possible to encounter bugs, reported issues are resolved as soon as possible. Visit Workflowy Encrypter's GitHub page for further details."
