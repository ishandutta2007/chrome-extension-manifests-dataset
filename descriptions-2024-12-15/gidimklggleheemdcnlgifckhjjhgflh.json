An AI experiment created together with Daniel Shiffman and some friends at Google. \n\nGoogle Lab Sessions is a series of experimental AI collaborations with innovators. In our latest Lab Session, we partnered with noted programming professor and YouTube creator, Daniel Shiffman, to develop an experimental LLM (a downloadable Chrome extension called ShiffBot) that uses Shiffman’s inspirational teaching style and educational corpus to help learners overcome coding challenges in p5.js without just giving them the answer. \n\nOnce the extension has been added, go to https://editor.p5js.org/ and you should see Dan’s smiling face and a chat box in the lower right-hand corner of your screen! And if you need help or encouragement in p5.js, just type your question in the chat!\n\nTo learn more about the project, visit shiffbot.withgoogle.com"
