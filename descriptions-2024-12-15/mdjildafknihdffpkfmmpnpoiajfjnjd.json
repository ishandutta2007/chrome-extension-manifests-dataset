This add-on automatically answers consent pop-ups for you, so you can't be manipulated. Set your preferences once, and let the technology do the rest!\n\nThis add-on is built and maintained by workers at Aarhus University in Denmark. We are privacy researchers that got tired of seeing how companies violate the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Because the organisations that enforce the GDPR do not have enough resources, we built this add-on to help them out. \n\nWe looked at 680 pop-ups and combined their data processing purposes into 5 categories that you can toggle on or off. Sometimes our categories don't perfectly match those on the website, so then we will choose the more privacy preserving option.\n\nThe first version of this add-on works with 4 popular pop-ups: Cookiebot, OneTrust, QuantCast, and TrustArc. The add-on is open source, so anyone can add additional pop-ups through our template system: https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic.\n\nMost recent changes:\n* Fixed issues related to manifest v3 \n* Fixed a bug causing some rules to not complete properly, leaving the popup open"
