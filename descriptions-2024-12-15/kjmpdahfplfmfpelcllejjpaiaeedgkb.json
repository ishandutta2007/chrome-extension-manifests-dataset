Sometimes it's because the work or reading on the pages is not finished yet. This extension helps you save current tab or current window, to get back to them later. You can set reminders on the saved pages, and you'll get a reminder in time.\n\nThanks for using Look Back. If you have any questions or suggestions, please leave a comment."
