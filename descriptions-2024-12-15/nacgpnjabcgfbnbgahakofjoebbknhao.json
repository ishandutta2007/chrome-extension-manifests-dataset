Most users don't use this and to their frustration and probably yours, Chrome takes you to the previous page. This often happens when you have spent time to type something lengthy in an online form only to lose all that work.  \n  \nThis extension mediates in those cases and disables the backspace key shortcut from ruining your productivity. It allows the conventional use of the backspace key as a text delete key.  \n   \nNO ADWARE. NO TROJANS. NO VIRUSES.  \n  \nThis is an update to the BackStop extension developed by Matt Cranham. It fixes the issues brought up in the comments."
