All of this data and recommendations to price and promote vehicles creates transparency within the dealership therefore creating a connection between GM to the Sales department  to the Marketing department to the Inventory department. Now each department knows which vehicles are being promoted and what it’s priced at at any point time.\n\nFeatures that you can look forward to be using and viewing are:\n\nBoosting\nLotLinx’s artificial intelligence platform now offers the ability to recommend when to promote the vehicle. We call this “Boost”. Boosting a vehicle is effectively advertising and promoting the vehicle through the LotLinx machine learning omnichannel platform to capture moments in order to drive shoppers to your VDP’s. Being informed and alerted on when to promote your vehicle will help reduce any digital wastage and maximize full profit potential.\n\nPrice Recommendation\nLotLinx’s artificial intelligence platform now offers a Price Recommendation that allows you to compare what you have listed to what you could price based on LotLinx’s proprietary shopper and market data. Price discounting is not the only lever you have, especially when you have access to shopper demand data at a moment's notice.\n\nBuyer Demand\nLotLinx’s proprietary Shopper Demand Market Index now allows you to uniquely view the number of shoppers and the rated demand in your market area for that vehicle. The graph allows you to view whether the demand is High or Low therefore providing you more information on how you wish to manage the vehicle\n\nVDP <> Price Graph\nThis graph provides the view of Google Analytics VDP data for that particular vehicle with a cross reference to Price that will now provide a view on the relationship between Price and VDP’s by calendar days.\n\n3rd Party Listing Badges\nLotLinx has now started to compile badges and rankings at the vehicle view from the three (3) leading listing portals: CarGurus, Autotrader and Cars.com. This provides informative context based on your current price in one view."
