Increase Useful Point for user every minute. \n    2. Display the Floating Button to allow user to continuously see the increased point to encourage use.\n\n3. When browsing useless sites: 💸\n    1. Increase Useless Points for user every minute.\n    2. Display the flashing Floating Button, let the user continuously see the increasing score, and let the user realize the passage of time.\n    3. Quotes are popped up from time to time, trying to let user get away from the useless content.\n\n4. Snooze function: 🔕\nWe know that people always need to have time to devote themselves to relaxation, just one click, during this time, there will be no more interruptions:\n    1. No more checkboxes\n    2. Turn off the Floating Button to stop prompting quotes\n    3. Useful/Useless Point will not be counted\n\n    Snooze will be canceled after the time specified by the user\n    Of course, the user can cancel Snooze at any time at the demo page\n\n    \n5. Results analysis: 📈📉📊\n    1. Useless points accumulated from Useful points earned daily\n    2. Accumulated Useful and Useless points earned\n\n6. Quotes function: 👼👼🏻👼🏼👼🏽👼🏾👼🏿\n    1. Let user add quotes to encourage themselves\n    2. Preset more than 10 little helpers, each helper will continue to add quotes, user can press the \"Favourite\" button and the quotes will pop up when browsing useless sites\n\n    \nThe bad news is time flies.
