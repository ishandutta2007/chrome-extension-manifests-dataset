With this extension installed, users can click a button on their browser, and the system will automatically generate a summary of the page. Alternately, the user can select specific text on the page and the tool will summarize the selected text only.\n\nThis saves users time and effort in trying to extract the essential information from lengthy articles or web pages. In a Nutshell uses advanced algorithms and natural language processing to generate concise and accurate summaries. It's perfect for anyone who needs to skim through lots of information quickly, such as researchers, students, or busy professionals."
