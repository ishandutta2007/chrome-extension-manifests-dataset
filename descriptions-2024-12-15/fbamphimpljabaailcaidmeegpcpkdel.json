At the same time, tools that can operate on such data are indexed by repositories such as OMICStools. However, direct associations between datasets and tools are currently not available. The Datasets2Tools  Google Chrome extension displays icons that provide links to canned analyses from dataset landing pages of data repositories such as DataMed and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Such canned analyses are coming from the Datasets2Tools registry. By providing a simple and intuitive platform to link datasets to analysis tools, Datasets2Tools lowers the point of entry for many users of biomedical research repositories, furthering the conversion of data into knowledge."
