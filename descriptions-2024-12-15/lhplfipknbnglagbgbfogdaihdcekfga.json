Use the right-click context menu item to direct PDF links to Foxit PDF Reader.\n2. Click the action button on PDF pages to transfer the PDF file to Foxit PDF Reader.\n3. On the options page, customize the extension settings to open PDF links with Foxit Reader.\n\nNotes:\n1. Because Foxit Reader cannot directly open remote PDF links, this extension initially downloads the PDF file to your browser's default download directory and then activates the external PDF reader.\n2. To establish communication with Foxit Reader, install a small native client specific to this extension. This client is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems. ChromeOS is not supported.\n3. Ensure you have Foxit PDF Reader installed on your device. This extension only simplifies Foxit Reader integration with your browser and does not perform the installation.\n\n--- Legal\nFoxit Reader is a registered trademark of Foxit Software Incorporated, registered in the U.S. and other countries. This extension is an independent project and is not affiliated with Foxit Software. It serves as a tool designed to enhance the PDF reading experience."
