Click the extension to launch our Toolbar on any webpage or PDF.  This will save it to your Scrible account and open up a Toolbar with tools to highlight, comment, and more.  If you revisit a page you've previously saved to your account with the Toolbar, the Toolbar will automatically launch and reload your annotations. \n \nHistorically, teachers and students have had to manage multiple tools through the research and writing workflow. Scrible consolidates those tools in one place, streamlining a student's process of curating, annotating, citing and writing.  Our Toolbar lets you:\n - Save web pages, PDFs and database articles instantly\n - Highlight key facts and passages to refer to later\n - Annotate and add comments to capture first thoughts\n \nOnce pages are saved, in the Scrible Library users can:\n - Quickly browse and full text search through sources\n - Organize source information with categorical tags\n - Select sources to add to a bibliography\n \nSign into your Scrible account to access your Scrible Library or sign up for a free account at https://www.scrible.com/sign-in/\n \nScrible supports learning across multiple content areas (e.g. ELA, social studies, science, foreign language), programs (e.g. AP Capstone, IB), support areas (e.g. SPED, ELL), project types (e.g. science fair, National History Day) and initiatives (e.g. personalized learning, project based learning, writing across the curriculum). Scrible also supports special education and ELL students and educators.  Learn more at https://www.scrible.com/\n \nHave any questions?
