The extension icon also lets you share normal pages as well as open the options page.\n\nThe button opens a new window which takes the Doc URL and gives it to Classroom (https://classroom.google.com/share?url=...), all on your computer.\n\nFrom there, choose which class to share it to, change the description and customise the task just like you would on the normal Google Classroom™ website.\n\nThis extension is not associated with Google.\n\nThe extension uses the images of the Classroom Share button (https://developers.google.com/classroom/guides/sharebutton)\n\nContact hello@techniko.ml for questions, comments, bugs or feature requests"
