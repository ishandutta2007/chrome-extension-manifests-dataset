Connecting with your team is now easier then ever.\n\nAion teams, or cloud-based team management software was born out of an observation that as teams and organizations switched to semi-permanent form of distribute work there were very few tools that would help them organise their in person/distributed time with a view to optimising their collective intelligence and output.\n\nAion is focused on optmising the way that teams allocate and spend their time in order improve their collective happiness, innovation and productivity.\n\nAion Teams is a website, where organizations can register, create physical and virtual workspaces, define physical and office capacities, invite team members and access a shared calendar view. The calendar view allows team members to:\n\n- Mark their daily work location, by choosing between distributed in office, or day off. This will allow team members to become aware of each other's work location and help companies monitor their office capacity.\n\n- Share their daily mood, by choosing an emoji that best describes how they feel at the start of the day and another at the end of the day. This will help pave the way for open conversations that will bring everyone closer together and boost your team's morale.\n\nThis new Chrome extension keeps users updated event when they are working on other tabs, allowing them to access their team's calendar, daily mood and location."
