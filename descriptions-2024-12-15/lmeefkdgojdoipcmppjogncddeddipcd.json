And now there are these_awful_underscores everywhere that Salesforce automatically inserts?\n\nDon't despair! With this extension, you'll never have to worry about that again. The API Name Transformer automatically adjusts the API names of fields and objects when creating and editing labels. You have the choice: You can use camel case, the naming convention where the words are joined together and the first word is lower case (example: myLabelName) or Pascal case, where all words including the first are capitalized (example: MyLabelName). \n\nIf you want, the Transformer can also put prefixes in front of the API names. And if you're feeling particularly crazy, it will even insert prefixes AND convert the names based on the naming convention you picked. It's all up to you!"
