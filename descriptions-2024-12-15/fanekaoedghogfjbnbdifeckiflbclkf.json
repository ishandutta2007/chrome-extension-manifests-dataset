It is automatically updated every time you open your browser.\n\nWe share our threat intelligence with everyone and encourage you to do the same.  If you've received a suspicious link,  don't click it, but share it with us instead and we can investigate and  protect all of our users from it.\n\nLegitimate businesses and organisations are impersonated everyday.  95% of cyber attacks are the result of successful phishing. \n\nHow does Phishing Net work?\n\nStep 1: In the background of Phishing Net, we are reading all of the links, websites and domains that are attempting to be loaded to view the website you are visiting, without recording any of your traffic.  All of this is checked against the Phishing Net Threat Intelligence database.\n\nStep 2: If the malicious link matches a link, website or domain in our database, Phishing Net will deny the traffic being loaded and redirect you to safety. \n\n36 million people have been targeted by scammers and hackers so far this year (2021).  \n\nInstalling our extension has no impact on your browsers performance at all.  Phishing Net is extremely lightweight, but also extremely powerful."
