However, tabs get tedious to navigate when there are a lot open. This extension will add number badges to the tabs' title as such: \" {#} - original_title \". The purpose of the number badges is to easily identify the index of the tab you would like to navigate to by using keyboard shortcuts, such as CMD-# on MAC and CTRL-# on WINDOWS. \n\nTo use this extension:\n--------------------------------\n1. Download the extension.\n2. Open a couple of tabs and navigate to web pages.\n3. Click on the badge icon next to the address bar to enable tab badges.\n4. Press CTRL-ALT while on any of the tabs to toggle state of badges on all tabs.\n5. Click on the badge icon next to the address bar to disable tab badges if you want to disable CTRL-ALT to toggle badge state.\nTab badge states can be toggled. If you press CTRL-ALT while the badges are not visible, they will be displayed. If the badges are visible, they will be hidden. \n\nNote: This extension only works on tabs that have a web page loaded (so if you create a new tab but do not navigate to a website, CTRL-ALT will not show badges on that page).\nAlso make sure to close the open tabs before downloading the extension to have badges show up on them :)\n\nFurther development\n-----------------------------\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to add anything to this extension! I would be glad to help out. Feel free to email me at biscim@gmail.com\n\nImprovements\n-------------------\n\nVersion 1.1 :\nThe badge state is disabled initially as indicated by a red badge color. To enable click on the extension, changing its color to the original black badge. Then the alt-ctrl keys are activated to toggle between badged and unbadged tab titles. Remember, to activate click on the *extension* (the black badge next to the address bar). To disable re-click on the extension.\n\nVersion 1.2 :\nBug Fix: When multiple instances of browser windows are open, turning the extension off/on may or may not disable/enable the keyboard shortcut (ctrl-alt) to show/hide badges in other windows. Now, if the extension is off or on, all browser windows will have the same behavior.\n\nVersion 1.3 :\nFeature addition: keeps tabs persistent when opening a new tab and refreshing an existing tab.\n\nVersion 1.4 :\nAdds a new badge state (temporary) that will allow you to see the badges as long as the ctrl key is pressed. When the ctrl key is released the badges wil disappear. You can activate this badge state by clicking on the extension icon twice until it turns blue. The red (off) state and the black (on) state still have the same behavior as version 1.3. Please see the new attached picture for more information on the different states.\n\nAlso, this version fixes some race conditions in which tab titles did not change when you activate/de-activate badge using ctrl-alt quickly. In order to fix this, I had to lag the change in the tab title by a fraction of a second. Thus, when you activate the badges using ctrl-alt (in the persistent case, black badge color) and ctrl in the temporary badge state (blue badge color) you will have to do it a little slower (specifically 350 ms ;)) than usual. Patience is a virtue :D\n\nAny feedback is highly appreciated!\n\nVersion 1.5 :\nBug fix: Temporary badge state didn't use to work well on Windows platform because of the way the keydown events are fired in chrome.\n\nVersion 1.5.1 :\nBug fix: Much more efficient way of handling keydown events that used to caused inconsistent behavior in showing/hiding badges. \n\nVersion 1.5.2 :\nBug Fix : Store badge state when chrome is closed and reopened so that the image of badge state reflects correct keyboard interaction. Thanks to Pablo Cantero for pointing this out."
