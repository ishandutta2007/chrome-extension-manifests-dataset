It's created to remind oneself that time in life is limited and is not to be wasted.\n\nIt's very easy to use. You simply enter your name and date of birth. Taking life expectancy as 80 years, it tells you how many weeks are left until you die. \n\nI find that weeks left is a powerful motivator because in our busy lives we live weekend to weekend, and days seem to rush by super fast.\n\nOptionally, you can also add what you have achieved so far, and what you are planning to achieve in future. This will act as an inspiration whenever you are in that mood of 'why do anything' :)"
