Indie Wiki Buddy will also filter results across ten search engines (including Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo), to help guide you to click on results from independent wikis.\n\nIndie Wiki Buddy supports over 200 independent wikis across 10 languages. And you're in full control -- you can choose your experience wiki-by-wiki! \n\nIndie Wiki Buddy also supports BreezeWiki, an affiliated service that renders Fandom wikis without ads or bloat. This helps give you a more enjoyable reading experience when an independent wiki isn't available.\n\nPlease visit the Indie Wiki Buddy website (https://getindie.wiki) for full details, guidance, FAQ, contact info, and how to submit wikis to be included in the extension.\n\n\nFandom is a trademark of Fandom, Inc. Fextralife is a trademark of Kinbundo Limited. Indie Wiki Buddy is not affiliated with either site."
