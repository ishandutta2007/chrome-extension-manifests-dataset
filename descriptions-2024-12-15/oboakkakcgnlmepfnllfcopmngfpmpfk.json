This could help reduce the clutter in a merge request or issue and help you focus on the active issues.\n\nIt does so by hiding all the resolved threads by default and giving you a checkbox to show them.  The checkbox is located up by the \"# unresolved threads\" message for merge requests and at the top of the activity section for issues.\n\nSee the project page for more information: https://gitlab.com/someguy20336/gitlab-tools"
