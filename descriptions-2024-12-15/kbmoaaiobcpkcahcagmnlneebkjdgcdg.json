Our focus is on influencing consumer behavior, which is directly responsible for approximately 21% of these emissions. Through Encore, we strive to encourage sustainable consumer practices within the fashion industry by simplifying the search for secondhand items. Our goal is to contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions by 1.6 metric tons by 2030, aligning with the 1.5 degree target established by the Paris Climate Change Agreement.\n\nWe firmly believe that the future of fashion lies in the secondhand market‚Äîa space where sustainability meets affordability.\n\nWe are convinced that the future of fashion resides in the secondhand market, a realm where sustainability and affordability intersect.\n\nüë• Join Our Discord Community:\n\nInvite link: https://discord.gg/Xesc8Q9D7Y\n\nBy clicking the link, you can join our Discord community and connect with others who are passionate about sustainable shopping and uncovering the best deals.
