With the extension installed, users can add checkboxes to each conversation in the sidebar, select multiple conversations to delete or archive, and accomplish this with just a few clicks.\n\nHold Shift and click to select multiple conversations for efficient bulk actions.\n\nThis extension is particularly useful for users who frequently use ChatGPT and need to manage their conversations efficiently. Instead of deleting conversations one by one, users can remove multiple conversations at once, saving both time and effort.\n\nAdditionally, this extension now offers a “bulk archive” feature for a one-time fee of $0.99 USD. This paid feature allows users to archive multiple conversations simultaneously, further enhancing the tool’s utility and convenience."
