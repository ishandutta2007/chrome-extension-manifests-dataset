Netizens often default to Google for services when there are many other amazing services available on the web, be it email or search. With the help of Nomoogle, you can avoid this and decrease your dependence on Google products.\n1. Nomoogle will show you a popup and ask you to reconsider every time you try to access a Google product.\n2. You can easily find alternatives to Google products with the help of Nomoogle with just one click.\n3. Nomoogle also lets you browse the web in two special modes: Redirect Mode and Strict Mode. In Redirect Mode, you are just redirected to an alternative whenever you try to access a Google website, e.g. DuckDuckGo for search when you try to open Google Search. In Strict Mode, you will simply be blocked from accessing Google websites. Enable this for a hardcore Google fast.\n\nWe advise you to spend some time with alternative products. It will be very difficult to live without Google initially, but you will get used to it once you give it some time. Good luck!"
