The change histories for these elements are already stored by Trello, but access to this information is not currently provided by the standard user interface.\n\nThis extension is also compatible with the popular Scrum for Trello extension, and will call out Agile point updates as part of its Name change analysis. Teams using Trello for Agile software development can leverage the change history provided by the extension to analyze how well a team is following best practices, such as:\n\n- has a change been made that might invalidate the card's point value?\n- are points being assigned/changed as a team?\n- are cards following proper grooming procedures before being queued up for development?\n- are groomed and/or in-flight cards commonly undergoing substantial revision? \n- etc."
