It combines the left speaker's content with the right speaker's and vice versa, so you effectively hear the same sound from both speakers. This can be helpful when the stereo image in the video is unbalanced, heavily leaning to the right or left, suffers from phase correlation issues, or you simply want to hear the entire audio using only one speaker.\n\nIt works on both video and audio elements on pages that support this feature. The extension is activated by clicking the left mouse button on its icon. For a full sound reset after adjusting the volume with the extension, it is recommended to reload the page.\n\nKnown issues:\n-    On some pages, it is not possible to adjust the stereo image of the played elements. This is due to how the specific page is designed.\n-    On some pages, when clicking on the extension button, the browser may mute the sound. This is due to the security configuration of the specific page or the server it is hosted on and unfortunately cannot be detected from the extension's point of view.\n\nIf you find this extension useful, you may consider supporting the author with a donation of any amount. Check the menu by right-clicking the extension button."
