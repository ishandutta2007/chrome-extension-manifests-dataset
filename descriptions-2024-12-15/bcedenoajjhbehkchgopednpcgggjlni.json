Unfortunately, the site is not so suitable for wide screens.\nThis extension is here to solve this \"issue\". We also take the opportunity to add 2 or 3 things, without ever, we hope, distorting the site.\n\nThe extension allows the website to extend to a width of 1600px instead of the current 950px.\nIt also displays the completion rate of a list, when it is available on the page.\n\nWe unify the colors of the gauges:\n* Orange => less than 25%\n* Blue => greater or equal to 25%\n* Green => fully completed (100%)\n\nWe display a chart showing the career development of the person. We also show a little more clearly their different referenced professions.\nYou can click on the photo of a person to display it in large format (when available).\n\nWe calculate the average of the scores (out of 5) and display it, like the one already existing for films.\n\nYou can check what award a movie or people has won. For now, we have: \n* Academy Awards (US)\n* BAFTA (UK)\n* Césars (FR)\n* Berlinale (DE)\n(more to come.)\n\nA few trivia from IMDb are added to movie page when possible.\n\nAnd if you like the extension, we're already considering some additions...\n\n*Image rights and logos belong to their respective owners.*"
