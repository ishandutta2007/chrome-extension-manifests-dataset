Its primary function is to identify and block fake domains, redirecting users to the official website they intended to visit.\n\nIn addition to preventing access to fake domains, the extension allows users to block any undesired websites and set a timer for temporary blocking. Users have complete control over which websites they want to block and for how long.\n\nAn example of how this extension works is when a user enters a website like sii.com, which is not the official site. The extension recognizes that it is a fake domain and automatically redirects the user to the official website, in this case, sii.cl . This way, users can safely browse the internet and avoid falling victim to fraudulent or malicious websites."
