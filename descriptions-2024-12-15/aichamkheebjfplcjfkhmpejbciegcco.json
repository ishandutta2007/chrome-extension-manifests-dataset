Med Access EMR users can take advantage of this extension to support more seamless and efficient workflows when using the Ocean Provider Network.\n\nPlease note that the extension is not currently supported or tested by Ocean for use with Ocean Patient Engagement tools (including Patient Messages).\n\nThe extension provides a streamlined way to include file attachments from a patient chart into an Ocean eReferral/eConsult, without needing to download the file onto the user's hard drive. This eliminates the need to download, attach, and manually delete attachments from your computer to protect patient health information.\n\nAdditionally, the extension streamlines the process for adjusting Ocean eReferral Tasks into the appropriate Task 'Category' and 'Type' in Med Access.\n\nPlease Note: The extension can be used in other areas of the patient's chart, including but not limited to investigation attachments, investigation reports, lab attachments, and lab reports. There is no time-based expiry on files. The attachment queue is automatically cleared.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Ocean-MA Extension FAQ at: ocean.tips/ma-extension\n\nTo access the open source project files, please visit the following Bitbucket repository: https://bitbucket.org/ocean-ma-extension/ocean-ma-extension/src/main/"
