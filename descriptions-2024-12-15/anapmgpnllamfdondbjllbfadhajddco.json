The geographic location obtained via JavaScript is often highly accurate, which can compromise your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows you to enjoy geolocation applications while protecting your privacy by reporting a fake location to websites. It does this by adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to your actual location. The noise is randomly selected to prevent your real location from being accurately determined. There is also an option to use a fixed location instead of adding noise to the real one.\n\nIMPORTANT: Location Guard Plus protects against highly accurate JavaScript-based geolocation, not the less accurate IP-based geolocation. If a website detects your approximate location from your IP address, you should use a VPN. Location Guard is not designed to address this issue."
