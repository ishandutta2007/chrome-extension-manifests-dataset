It's all too easy to mistakenly input your native language into 'DeepL Write.' Here's where 'DeepL Write Invert Colors' steps in. This straightforward plugin automatically inverts the colors of 'DeepL Write,' effectively differentiating it from 'DeepL Translate.' Say goodbye to confusion and lost timeâ€”with just a quick look, you'll know precisely where to type. As a fan of both services' outstanding functionalities, I designed this plugin to streamline your workflow and make the user interface even more user-friendly."
