When you click on one of the images on the surf bar, the extension automatically switches to an active tab.\n\nYou can set surf limit and various actions for each tab separately.\n\nAs a 'Free User', you can surf in 7 traffic exchanges at the same time. As a 'Paid Member', you can surf in any number of traffic exchanges at the same time, limited only by the performance of your device.\n\nThis extension does not violate the terms of Manual Traffic Exchanges!\n\nCurrently, the best known manual traffic exchanges are supported, but new sites are added regularly.\n\n\nMain features:\n============\n\nYou can set the tab's surfing limit from 1 to 9999, at which point the 'Limit Action' will be executed. You can also set a value of 0, which means that there are no limits at all.\n\nYou can set whether the tab is need to be included in the rotation or not when the surfing starts.\n\nYou can mute or unmute tab's sound separately\n\nYou can select which function to run when you press the stop button. All functions run in the background, but the 'Go' functions switch to the stopped tab once they are completed. If the selected action not supported by the Traffic Exchange, the member's home will be loaded. \n\nYou can choose which function to run when the surfing limit reached. 'Pause Rotation' leaves the tab with the active surf bar open and untouched. It simply skips the tab from further rotation.\n\n\nSubscription - No Refund Policy:\n==========================\n\nOnce your subscription starts, you can't get a refund for any payments you've already made. You can cancel your subscription at any time before its auto-renewal date. You will still have access to the subscription until the end of the period you paid for.\n\n\nNote:\n=====\n\nYou can find the 'Terms And Conditions' and  the 'Privacy Policy' in the 'About & Help' menu of the extension and on the extension's website."
