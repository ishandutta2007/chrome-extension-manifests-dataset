But you still open fb to see your friend's posts, not ads.\n\nIsn't it a shame to waste any amount of time, trying to discern original from promoted content? Wouldn't you like a more distractless environment?\n\nAdd Newsfeed Filter and watch all distractions gone - or just the ones you don't like\n\nNOTE: The only data this extension stores are your choices regarding its options. They are stored on a browser related database and I have no access on them. No data from your actual facebook content are stored or sent anywhere."
