Once you open the app for the first time, you will see a sidebar at the left and an empty text editor at the right. The left sidebar includes file I/O buttons. For example, a button to open file(s), folder or settings. There is also a right sidebar which includes all the options for this app.\n\nNote: currently, Text Editor supports all the keyboard shortcuts for the Sublime text editor only. Moreover, it also supports more than 10 languages (i.e. JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc.)\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form in the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/text-editor.html)."
