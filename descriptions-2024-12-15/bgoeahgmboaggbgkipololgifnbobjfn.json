If you have been working on your computer for 10 minutes or longer you might already have three linkedIn job applications, four YouTube tutorials, several StackOverflow pages, and two seperate tabs of React documentation. This big, nostalgic, satisfying button Thanos snaps all of these tabs with one quick javaScript function, leaving one instance of each website open including your currently active tab.\n\nNote:\nThis goes by hostname of the URL object in JS. So if you have for example mail.google.com and google.com, it will see these as two different websites. But if you have google.com/search/example1 and google.com/search/example 2, it will leave only one open."
