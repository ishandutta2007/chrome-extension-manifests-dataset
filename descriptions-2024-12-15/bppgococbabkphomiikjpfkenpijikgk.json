After three visits to the site, separated by closing and opening the browser, the extension begins to replace the cookies received from such a site with random values. Of course, cookies protected by httpOnly are not and cannot be replaced. Getting started on replacing cookies from the third launch of the browser allows you to login through the chrome password manager. The extension does not interfere with the .google.com domain\nBasically, these cookies are screen parameters, technical records. All this is not very effective in the fight against digital eavesdroppers, just a little dirty trick due to the large computing power of today's computers, almost invisible to the user.\n\nThe extension automatically changes cookies, you do not need to keep track of what you have been placed and why, with a new visit to the site, the site will receive random values, which will be very surprised. Sometimes you can be surprised yourself, a change in theme, language, and other delights. Also, some sites have cookies - counters, there is only one cookie file, the extension will make it random. “Count as much as you want” is our message. The very existence of this extension compromises any data collected by the cookie and any inferences from such data. For the first time, we have in our hands not a shield, but a sword.\nFor freedom!"
