Customize the fields you want to see, define relations between your Data Sources, build segments to zero in on high-priority records, and automate workflows with actions – all of this and more is waiting for you.\n\nWriting an email to a customer? With Databread, you can review open tickets, past feature requests, last marketing outreach & more without leaving your page.\n\nViewing an opportunity in your CRM? Databread will automatically present you with any related records, making it easy to understand the full story of the opportunity without complex integrations or any heavy lifting.\n\nUsing automation platforms like Zapier or Tray.IO?
