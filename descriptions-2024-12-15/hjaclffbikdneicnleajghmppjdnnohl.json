Choose all the sites you waste too much time on, and Scroll Stop will prevent you from browsing further than you tell it to on those sites.\n\nSimply tell Scroll Stop which websites to be active on, how far it should let you scroll on each, and whether you want Scroll Stop to close the distracting tab, clear it of all contents, or direct you to another website once you've hit your limit.\n\nScroll Stop does not store any information outside your computer, and is 100% ad-free. We don't track you, record your data, or do anything else nefarious. Scroll Stop is a simple solution to a common problem, with none of the marketing or tracking code that makes competing applications slow and bloated.\n\nSpend less time scrolling, and more time working!\n\nScroll Stop is a project of indigoBox Studios."
