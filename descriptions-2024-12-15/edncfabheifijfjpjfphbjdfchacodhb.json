Credibility Detection: Automatically highlights posts with low credibility.\n2. Informed Responses: Generate responses based on the latest news and data to foster meaningful conversations.\n3. Reliable Sources: Continuously updated news database every two hours to ensure accuracy.\n\nImportant Usage Notes:\n\nBeta Version: This extension is currently in development and is being continuously improved.\nVerification Required: Large Language Models (LLMs) can occasionally produce errors. Always verify critical information before sharing.\n\nLLM Details:\n\n1. Current Model: The extension currently uses OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo. Users need to input their own OpenAI API keys.\n2. Future Plans: We are actively working on integrating other OpenAI models and open-source alternatives as funding allows."
