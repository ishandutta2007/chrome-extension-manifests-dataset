The one you saved so you could revisit it down the line and appreciate the authors eloquence all over again, and then NEVER saw again? \n\nQuotsy helps you hold on to and manage these literary gems. Just select a chunk of text, right click and click on 'Add to Quotsy' to add it to your collection. Quotsy also spices up your boring new-tab page on Chrome by replacing it with an elegant background adorned with a randomly picked quote from your collection."
