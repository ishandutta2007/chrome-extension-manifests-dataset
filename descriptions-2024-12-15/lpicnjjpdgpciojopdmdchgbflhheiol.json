That way everything fits neatly into your tabs and you don't have windows flying everywhere.\n\nThe next time you have a popup open, simply click on the toast notification that shows up to merge the popup window into the main browser window.\n\nYou can also click on the extension icon in the toolbar on the main browser window too.\n\nBonus:\n\nI am pleased to report that this extension requests no discernible permissions, so you may use it in complete confidence."
