All you have to do is choose a mail recipient and click send.\n\nAn easy way to share webpages with your contacts and friends.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nTechnical information:\nThis extension is using the \"mailto:\" protocol, so all email related issues like which mailclient that opens up and how the mail is formatted is \nrelated to your system and what your system does with the \"mailto:\" protocol. So if things don't work as expected or you want to change things, then check your systems \"mailto:\" protocol settings.\n\nChangelog: \n0.9.5.2 - updated to support Manifest version 3.\n\n0.9.5 - fixed a bug that sometimes just opened a blank page. Should be fixed now."
