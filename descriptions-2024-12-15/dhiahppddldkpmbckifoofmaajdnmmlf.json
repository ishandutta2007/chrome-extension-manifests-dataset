In other words, although you might have bought your hosting setup from one company, that company might be leasing their server space from someone else.\n\nQuite commonly in today’s market, cloud hosting companies like DigitalOcean, Vultr, Amazon AWS, or Google Cloud rent their server space to other operators. Those operators then resell the servers to their own clients.\n\nOur hosting checker tool tells you if that’s the case with your host."
