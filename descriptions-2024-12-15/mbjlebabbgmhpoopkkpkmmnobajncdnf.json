We do not sell data or make money from your data. Indeed, we neither collect individual data nor can we see individual data.\n\nOur top priorities are privacy and security: all collected data is encrypted and analyzed anonymously at an aggregated level. The OPPS extension has been engineered with robust measures to ensure that personal information remains private and secure, aligning with our commitment to user privacy and data protection standards. Further details on our state-of-the-art privacy protection are available on the project website at https://op-ps.org/\n\nOPPS requires a Mechanical Turk Worker ID to process payment; however, the ID is not connected to individual browser data. If you would like to participate but do not yet have a Mechanical Turk ID you can sign up on Amazon at https://www.mturk.com/worker\n\nOPPS has approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Washington University (ID# 202312041). If you are concerned about your rights as a research participant, you can contact the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University at https://hrpo.wustl.edu/about-us/contact-us/ or by calling 314-747-6800.\n\nFor transparency, the source code of the plugin is available at https://github.com/sambux1/opps-client.
