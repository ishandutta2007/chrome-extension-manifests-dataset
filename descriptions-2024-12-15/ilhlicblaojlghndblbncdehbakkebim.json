A new tab will open and the direct download link will be generated in a few seconds (wait for the \"Status: finished\" text). If the file is not publicly shared, other people won't be able to use that download link. To fix this issue, you can right click the file, select \"Get link\" and change the visibility from \"Restricted\" to \"Anyone with the link\". This will automatically share the file publicly\n\n2) To get the direct download links of all files in a Drive™ folder, simply right click the folder and open it with this extension. A new tab will open and the direct download links will be generated progressively (wait for the \"Status: finished\" text). If a file is not publicly shared, other people won't be able to use its download link. To fix this issue, it is sufficient to make the folder that contains your files public. To do this, you can right click the folder, select \"Get link\" and change the visibility from \"Restricted\" to \"Anyone with the link\". This will automatically share the folder publicly\n\nNOTE1: downloading big files using a direct download link will prompt a Drive™ dialog stating that \"The file exceeds the maximum size that Google can scan.\" and the user must click the \"Download anyway\" button to proceed.\n\nNOTE2: documents created in Drive (Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Forms) can't be downloaded directly. To generate direct download links for these documents, you need to convert these documents to a standard file format (e.g. .doc, .docx, .ppt, .xls).\n\nSource code available at: https://github.com/yasirkula/DownloadLinkGeneratorForGoogleDrive"
