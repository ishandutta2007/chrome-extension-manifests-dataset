If you have to wait a perceptible amount of time, that's a bug.\n\n## Features\n\nUse the key bindings similar to Vi to navigate Hacker News stories and comments.\nIt should work on story listings (front page, /new, /newest, /best, user submissions, etc.), comment threads, and comment listings (user comments, etc.).\n\nAlso, you can quickly find new comments by hitting “n” to browse comments in inverse chronological order.\n\nIn addition, the quick-reply and quick-edit forms let you see a preview of the comment you are writing.\n\nFinally, the original poster (OP) is highlighted in comments.\n\n## Key bindings\n\nPress ? to toggle help.\n\nNote: Like in Vim mapping, case is important. So j means hitting the j key with Caps Lock disabled, and without holding Shift. But J means hitting j key with either Caps Lock enabled, or while holding Shift.\n\n### Navigate Comments/Stories\n\n- j: Next comment/story\n- k: Previous comment/story\n- J: Next sibling comment\n- K: Previous sibling comment\n- g: Go to first story/comment\n- G: Go to last story, last root comment or “More” link\n- H: Focus on story/comment at the top of the screen (high)\n- M: Focus on story/comment in the middle of the screen\n- L: Focus on story/comment at the bottom of the screen (low)\n- n: Switch to Newest Items\n- h: Parent comment/story (see Follow Links)\n- p: Parent comment/story (see Follow Links)\n\nNote:\nYou can also select an item by clicking in its bounding box.\n\n### Follow links\n\n- o: Open story link/comment\n- O: Open story link/comment in background\n- c: Open comment thread\n- C: Open comment thread in background\n- b: Open both story link and comment thread\n- B: Open both story link and comment thread in background\n- h: Follow “context” link (go to comment thread, but focus on current comment)\n- p: Follow “parent” link (go to parent's page, and focus on parent comment/story)\n- 1: Open 1st link in comment (maintain shift to open in background)\n- …: …\n- 9: Open 9th link in comment (maintain shift to open in background)\n- 0: Open 10th link in comment (maintain shift to open in background)\n\nNote:\nWhen on the “XXX more comments” link, you can hit either of `[lLcC]` to go to the next page of comments.\n\nNote:\nThe digits of the numeric keypad work as well to open links in comments.\nHowever, this can only open links in foreground.\n\nNote:\nWhen using AZERTY, the key bindings to open links inside comments still work like in QWERTY.\nHit the 1 key without shift (like typing `&`) to open the 1st link in foreground.\nHit the 1 key with shift (like typing `1`) to open the 1st link in background.\nSame for the other link numbers.\n\n### Actions\n\n- m: Collapse/uncollapse comment tree\n- u: Upvote story/comment, or cancel vote\n- d: Downvote story/comment, or cancel vote\n- f: Favorite/un-favorite story/comment of the current page\n- F: Flag/unflag story/comment of the current page\n- r: Comment on story, or reply to comment (with preview)\n- e: Edit comment (with preview)\n- D: Delete comment\n- Ctrl+Return: Submit current form\n\n### Navigate Newest Items\n\nIn the Newest Items list, the following key bindings are available:\n\n- l: Show selected comment/story\n- j: Next comment/story\n- k: Previous comment/story\n- J: Jump 10 down\n- K: Jump 10 up\n- g: Go to top story/comment\n- G: Go to last story/comment\n- n: Switch back from Newest Items"
