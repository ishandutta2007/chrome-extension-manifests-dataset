This simple plugin randomly selects students from your currently visible seating plan and then asks you if you know the student's name. A feedback process ensures you see those you don't know more frequently until you've learnt the class.\n\nNo data is captured or sent anywhere - everything happens within your browser itself, based only on the seating plan which is currently open."
