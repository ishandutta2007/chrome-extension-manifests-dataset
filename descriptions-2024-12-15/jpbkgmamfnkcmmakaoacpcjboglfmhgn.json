How much effort does each person put into the conversations? ForenShips lets you view trends over time at large as well as zoom in to view specific exchanges. You'll also be notified of systematic problems, such as a tendency to ramble on when they are not interested.\n\nSteps:\n1. Go to Facebook's full message page for the conversation you want to analyze\n2. Click ForenShips' icon that shows up in the right side of your url bar\n3. Wait for analysis of conversations (sorry, we're working to make it load faster!)\n\nAnalysis:\nYour overall relationship score is out of 100. The higher the number, the more healthy and balanced the relationship is.\n\nSentiment is a general measure of how friendly the exchanges are. 0 is very negative and 1 is highly positive. \n\nBias is a measure of how much effort each side is putting into the conversations. A positive bias means you put in more effort than them."
