Currently, only Youtube is supported.\n\nHOW TO USE:\n\n1. Install the PACT extension and click on the PACT logo in your browser toolbar to set your native language. (The default native language is based on your browser language, so this step may be optional.)\n\n2. If you're preparing for an English test or wish to prioritize certain vocabulary domains (such as academic, business, legal, etc.), you can adjust these preferences in the settings. The selected words will then be prioritized for practice.\n\n3. Choose a video and click the PACT logo in the lower-right corner. PACT will automatically pause the video and display the selected practice exercises when the subtitles are reached.\n\n4. Enjoy!\n\nCredit: The PACT logo was designed using assets from Freepik.com."
