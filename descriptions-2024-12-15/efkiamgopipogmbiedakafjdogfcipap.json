If you have lightning access, just switching to classic wont recreate the Access Denied page.\nThis extension works on any object as long as the URL as a SF 18 digit ID in it. \nEx:   https://mydomain.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0062G12345g8FK9QAM/view  will get redirected to https://mydomain.my.salesforce.com/0062G12345g8FK9QAM \n\n*NOTE: URLs that don't have an 18 digit ID like the Opportunities Homepage (https://mydomain.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Opportunity/list?filterName=Recent) will still fail because the extension can't know what the correct url to go is: https://mydomain.my.salesforce.com/006?fcf=00B12345000uLr4  <-- Opportunities Recent list page   (No one should really be sharing these kinds of page links anyway but Im sure it happens)    \n\nHow to test: (before installing plugin (if already installed turn it off via the extensions chrome page - chrome://extensions/ )\n - Navigate to a specific lightning detail record page\n - Copy the lightning URL from the browser\n - Login as a classic only user \n - Paste lightning URL > Enter\n - This should result in the Access Denied page\n - Install / turn on extension\n - Paste lightning URL > Enter\n - Should be redirected to Classic record page"
