Analyses the text content of your email\n2. If you click the send button without attachments, it will pause the sending process, and give you a small warning.\n3. You can review the warning, add attachments, or ignore it!\n4. Try not to screw up the second chance, but even if you do, MailAttach got your back!\n\nLet's talk about privacy! We respect that emails can be confidential, that's why there is no external server that is handling your data.\n\nCurrently, the extension supports Gmail, more email clients will be added in future updates!"
