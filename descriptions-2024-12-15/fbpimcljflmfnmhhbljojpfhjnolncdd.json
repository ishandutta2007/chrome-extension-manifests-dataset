This extension makes the process quicker and easier. \n\nAbout \n\nKirobo has created this Chrome extension to enhance the Dapp Connect feature of the Liquid Vault. This is an alternative to copy-pasting the dapp's WalletConnect address into the Liquid Vault manually. \n\nAfter download and installation, just connect your Liquid Vault to your chosen dapp, as you usually would. Then open the extension and click 'connect'. When you do this, the dapp will appear in the extension with a connect/disconnect toggle.  \n\nHow does it work? \n\nWhen the extension is activated, it will connect between tabs on your Chrome browser. So when a dapp connection is turned on, you just need to access that dapp and a window will pop up - click connect and the Liquid Vault will open automatically in a new tab. The extension connects the two, bypassing MetaMask. However, it will also connect directly between your MetaMask and the dapp, so switching between your MetaMask and Liquid Vault is easy. The extension makes the process of interacting with dapps much easier by removing the need to switch between tabs all the time.\n\n\nBenefits\n\nDapp Connect lets you use the DeFi ecosystem safely. Whether swapping on a DEX, minting an NFT, transferring funds, or anything else, the assets will go directly into your protected Liquid Vault.\n\nWhat is the Liquid Vault? \n\nThe Liquid Vault is a non-custodial, on-chain wallet and DeFi services platform that you connect to via any leading crypto wallet. Apart from standard wallet services, the Liquid Vault protects your assets with its core security features - for example, its backup feature lets you define a secondary wallet to serve as a spare key in case you lose access. It also has an inheritance feature, allowing you to define heirs to receive shares of your assets in case the worst happens."
