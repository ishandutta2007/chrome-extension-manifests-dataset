Throughout the day we all experienced the frustration of being overwhelmed by the number of tabs we had open within our browser. We wanted a better way to both to view, organize, and share these online resources. We utilize socket.io along side Sequelize/postgreSQL and Express to manage our backend and user connections. In the front end we use React with the React Drag and Drop framework, as well as redux to create a responsive user experience. This project consists of a chrome extension that works in combination with a single page web application. The extension allows us to handle user tab data, through the utilization of the chrome api, to our web application to provide the user with the ability to seamlessly move from space to space with an organized collection of their online resources."
