For example, you could limit yourself to ten minutes a day on Facebook, or half an hour a day on Duolingo.\n\nWhen you approach your limit, Limit gently notifies you your time is almost up, so you can wrap up. And when you've reached your limit, you'll be directed to Freedom's calming Green Screen when you try to visit a limited website.\n\n- You can add or delete any website from the list of sites \n- Your time limit for each site is configurable, from 5 to 500 minutes\n- Limit comes pre-seeded with 10 distracting sites\n\nLimit is a product of Freedom Labs, where we develop new tools to help you balance your relationship with technology. Like our other extensions, Limit is highly privacy-conscious. None of your data is sent anywhere (the cloud, our servers, etc.) It remains secure on your own device. Learn more about Freedom here: https://freedom.to\n\nWe hope you find Limit to be a simple and useful tool for developing healthier online habits and routines.\n\nPlease note: Limit 1.0.3 is third release with Manifest 3 compatibility.  You may experience slight differences in behavior due to the significant changes required to comply with Manifest V3.  Please send us your feedback at support@freedom.to and we'll continue to improve Limit.  Thank you!\n\nRelease notes - 1.0.3:\nüêû Fixes a bug with our countdown timer notifications"
