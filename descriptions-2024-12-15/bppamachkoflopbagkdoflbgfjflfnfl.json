WebRTC Leak Shield protects you from this security threat. This is a must have extension for protecting your privacy on the internet. \n\nWebRTC Leak Shield requires following permissions:\n\nprivacy: This allows the extension to change the webrtc settings of the browser to prevent WebRTC IP Leak\n\nstorage: To store configuration file and current state of the extension\n\nmanagement: This extension is standalone and does not require any other extension to function but other extension such as VPN extension can embed the functionality of this extension in their extension. (For example: Hoxx VPN). This permission is needed to ensure the communication between WebRTC Leak Shield and other extensions which are using its functionality."
