Currently, Blur is incentivizing users to place bids on their platform to boost liquidity in the NFT ecosystem. There's a daily leaderboard for people who have taken the most risk in providing liquidity close to the \"floor\" (cheapest) price of different collections.\n\nThis is a chrome extension to\n* display 24h bidding points and their rank on a wallet's portfolio page\n\nOften people have to go back and forth between their portfolio page and the leaderboard to check their rankings and current bids. With this extension, people will not have to do that. A simple chrome extension to boost productivity."
