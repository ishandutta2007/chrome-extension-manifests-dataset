Our mission is to harness the power of technology, using it to prevent misleading or false information from influencing politics.\n\nOUR APPROACH:\n\n1. To identify potentially misleading sources of information.\n\n2. To educate readers and help them become resilient to ‘fake news’.\n\nHow does News Lens work?\n\nNews Lens is a browser extension for Chrome that searches all links on a given web-page for references to unreliable news sources, checking against a manually compiled list of domains obtained from OpenSources.\n\nWhenever a link appears on your screen that references a potential source of ‘fake news’, News Lens highlights the link in red. You’ll see a magnifying glass on either side of the source in question. Hovering over the link will reveal a text-box that outlines reasons for warning readers.\n\nNews Lens targets the spread of misinformation on online platforms, particularly social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.\n\nDownload the News Lens extension today!"
