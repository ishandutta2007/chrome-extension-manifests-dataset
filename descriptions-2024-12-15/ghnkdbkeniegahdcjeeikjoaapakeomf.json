Well Simple Notepad allows you to do just that! In fact Simple Notepad lets you create as many notes as you want. Do you use more than one installation of Chrome? Then your notes will sync across your different installations using your bookmarks so you'll never have to worry about keeping your notes in sync manually, or wonder what the note said on your other machine, it just happens! \n\nOk so enough of the waffle here is a feature list:\n\n  -- Create multiple notes\n  -- Notes backed up to your Google bookmarks (this can be turned on/off in the Simple Notepad options)\n  -- Notes synced across Chrome installations (requires Bookmark Syncing)\n  -- Synchronizing on a schedule and manually force a synchronization.\n  -- It will remember where you were editing the note and keep the cursor position and even the selection.\n -- Resize the note window to whatever size you like.\n -- Copy selected text to a note using a right click menu.\n -- Copy a link to a note using a right click menu\n -- Copy the page title and URL to a note using a right click menu\n -- Can choose between the classic Simple Notepad layout and an Opera Notes style layout"
