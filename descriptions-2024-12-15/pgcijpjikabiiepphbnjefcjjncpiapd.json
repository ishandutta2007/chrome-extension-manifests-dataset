Turn you long links into short ones highlights.page/#####\n【3】Saved highlights are stored locally and restored back to page on your next visit.\n\nHOW TO USE\n• Step #1 - Select any text on a page, right-click and select \"Save Link to Highlight\". A link to your selected text will be in your clipboard.  \n\nRepeat Step 1 to add multiple highlights to your clipboard link.\n\n\n𝐇𝐈𝐆𝐇𝐋𝐈𝐆𝐇𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐓𝐈𝐏\nAvoid highlighting dynamic/real-time text - If the text on a page stopped highlighting you may have highlighted real-time text. Real-time text is text that changes sometimes live while you are on the page (ex. stock prices) or the next time you visit the page(ex. relative dates - posted 5 minutes ago). Tip: Highlight the area before the dynamic text and the area after. \n\n𝐃𝐈𝐒𝐂𝐋𝐀𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐑\nSave Link to Highlight uses the same built-in technology in Chrome as Copy link to highlight. Anyone can view a link shared with multiple highlights without this extension installed. Multiple highlights on a page will look and work the same as single highlights do."
