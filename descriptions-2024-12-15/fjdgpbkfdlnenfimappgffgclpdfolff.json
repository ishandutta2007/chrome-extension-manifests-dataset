And that's really not something to be proud of.\n\nBulgarian media often serves (political and ideological) agenda instead of independent journalism.\n\nIn order to fight this, I'd like to introduce this little extension. All it does is it informs readers of sponsorship/funding programs that benefit the website on display.\n\nThis extension strives to be as objective as possible. The current sponsorship/funding database is small-but-fast-growing. It's not yet comprehensive, but that sure is the goal.\n\nYou can boost Bulgarian Media Freedom by using this extension or by completing the list of known sponsorship/funding that are not yet mentioned. Please do that by opening an issue here: https://github.com/ydm/bulgarian-media-freedom/issues"
