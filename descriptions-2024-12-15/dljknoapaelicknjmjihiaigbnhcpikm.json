Open https://teams.microsoft.com in your browser and the rules will automatically start processing incoming messages.\n\nIf you're using the Edge browser, then you should make sure your Teams tab does not get put to sleep. Go to edge://settings/?search=sleep if you have sleeping tabs enabled, then make sure that teams.microsoft.com (or teams.live.com if you're using that) is added to the list of sites not to put to sleep.\n\nGot suggestions or having issues? Share them here: https://github.com/onhello-automation/onhello/issues\n\nYou can do more advanced customization by defining certain methods in your browser window. Details can be found in the extension's options page.\n\nThis extension is made to become very flexible and eventually handle apps other than Microsoft Teams."
