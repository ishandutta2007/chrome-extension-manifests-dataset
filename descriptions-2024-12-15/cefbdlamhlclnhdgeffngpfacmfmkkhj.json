For each route that you've climbed, all ticks except for the \"best\" one will be deleted. \"Best\" is defined as follows:\n\n* First, ticks' numbers of pitches are compared. Ticks with more pitches are considered better.\n* Next, ticks' styles are compared. Onsights are considered the best, then clean sends, and so on.\n* Next, ticks' dates are compared, with earlier ticks considered better.\n* As a final tiebreaker, ticks' IDs are compared. A lower ID (indicating\n  that a tick was recorded earlier) is considered better.\n\nThis extension as written as a companion to https://mpticks.web.app/ . The general idea is that you can periodically import your Mountain Project ticks into mpticks and then use this extension to delete repeated ticks from Mountain Project."
