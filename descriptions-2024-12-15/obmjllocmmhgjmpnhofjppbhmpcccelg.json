They were able to choose what to see by following right people.\n\nBut in recent days, it only spreads hate and controversial posts. All the good content creators either dont post as they dont have a reach or they switch to posting hate post. \n\nThis extension is a small attempt to make Twitter or X a better place. Even today, the \"Following\" tab usually shows post only from people you follow. Hence its a good place to dwell in. However its not default tab. \n\nThis extension, when enabled, hides the \"For you\" tab and selects \"Following\" tab by default. Hence you will not be distracted by hate posts and can read quality posts from people you follow."
