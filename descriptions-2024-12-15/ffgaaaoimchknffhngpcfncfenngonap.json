If the user like the quote it can buy from an Amazon link the book.\n\nThere are 4 share buttons to Telegram, Twitter, WhatsApp and Email. But the email is not automatic share if the quote is large, so it redirects to a page with a button to copy to clipboard the large quote to user send manually by the best way he finds.\n\nThe user can buy the book of the author of the random quote too.\n\nThis is the description of the Poemer Chrome extension."
