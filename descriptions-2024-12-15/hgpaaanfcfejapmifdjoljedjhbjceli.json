Improved encapsulation, i.e. methods/functions are now much better linked to their own bars (when there are multiple bars) (replaced many global variables), but keybindings will likely affect all bars at once. One can double click on the bar (not on a button thereon) to return it to its default position. Improved dragging of the bar. Fixed bugs relating to subtitles processing. Plus various other amendments.\n25/01/2021 - Now when the bar auto-hides, if you place the cursor where it was, it will reappear if it was clickable (unless perma-hidden).\n21/01/2021 - Alt+Shift+1-6 now gives speeds 11-16x, and Alt (+ Shift) + 0 gives 10x.\n15/01/2021 - Fixed options page bugs, and styling (for compatibility with dark mode).\n18/10/2020 - Amended focus/hover handling; now reads tags in SRT text written right to left; and SRT timecodes for 100 hours+ now supported. \n15/10/2020 - Fixes disappearing bug when the subs box, link div and controller bar are focussed/hovered over.\n07/10/2020 - Fixed incorrect switch button text when the video (currentSrc/)src changes, and also sets the playback rate to 1 when this happens (to avoid issues on some sites when they detect an attempt to speed through ads); amended link button code; made main bar padding and margins proportional.\n04/10/2020 - Works on all URI schemes (including ftp etc.); adds a new 'link' button (\"ðŸ”—\") that shows the src of the current media (may be 'blob://*') (Double click on the src text field to select all.)\n13/09/2020 - Fixed site blacklisting.\n23/08/2020 -  Amended default subtitle text-shadow CSS and changed default font-size to 148%\n21/08/2020 - Replaced default subtitle text-shadow CSS with proportional values.\n19/08/2020 - Replaced deprecated 'mousewheel' event listener.\n18/06/2020 - Remaining time indicator now updates when just the duration changes.\n17/06/2020 - Remaining time indicator now updates even when the video is paused.\n16/05/2020 - Minor fix to cleanup code.\n14/05/2020 - Better handling of subtitle tags, improved cleanup, and other minor fixes.\n07/05/2020 - Keeps video controls showing when video is isolated.\n05/05/2020 - The 'Toggle hide controller' key now attempts to display only the video with its controls enabled as well as toggling keys, this can help where the progress bar is normally inaccesible. The close button now only hides the bar, it can be brought back with the  'Toggle hide controller' key. Plus other minor fixes.\n23/01/2020- Prints current 'translate( (left/right)%, (top/bottom)%) )' to the console after having moved the subtitles.\n09/01/2020 - Amended remaining time indicator for some live streams (tells you how far behind the last buffered frames you are), and fixed the remaining time and switch button text.\n17/04/2019 - Fixed a bug where keys set as shortcuts could not be typed in text boxes.\n13/04/2019 - Now removes obsolete instances and fixes bug were arrow keys were disabled in the YouTube search bar.\n01/04/2019 - Disables undesired default shortcuts. \n25/03/2019 - Amended default colour matrix (makes black truly black).\n20/03/2019 - Amended default colour matrix.\n03/03/2019 - Fixed subtitle text area updating on file selection.\n02/03/2019 - Fixed subtitle toggling.\n02/02/2019 - Amendment to subtitle balancing.\n01/02/2019 - Fixed subtitle balancing.\n26/01/2019 - Only specified shortcuts will override native shortcuts."
