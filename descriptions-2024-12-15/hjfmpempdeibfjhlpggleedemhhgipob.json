Use this to do what Portnoy won't: kick'em off the blog.\n\nThe Barstool Bad Blogger Extension (BBBE) takes a list of all the bloggers for Barstool Sports and allows you to select the ones you don't want to see on the super page. If you accidentally \"fire\" someone you like or you actually want to read Nate's blogs again, then you can reset your choices and hire everyone back (no, Nickinsider/Manzo/Pirate Simon, not in real life). Bloggers are fired for a day, after which they're brought back. \n\nThe BBBE doesn't affect Davey Pageviews' ad viewability, so I don't think they should have a problem with it. I'm just really tired of reading Nate's blogs.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or want to talk about the technical components, feel free to give me a shout: hello@joecasson.com"
