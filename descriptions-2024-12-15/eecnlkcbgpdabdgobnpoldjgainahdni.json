With Secure Passwords, you only need to remember one master password and the passwords app will generate strong but unique passwords for all your different online accounts. \n\nThe passwords are generated locally in your browser, none of your data ever leaves your computer and the password tool can be used in offline mode as well.\n\nThe password generator internally uses the super-strong BCrypt encryption algorithm to generate the hashes and thus the passwords are almost impossible to break.\n\nThe code is open-source and can be download from Github. The password generator is also available as an Android App."
