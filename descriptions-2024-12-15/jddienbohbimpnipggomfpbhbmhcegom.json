The game is designed to be played on roll20. The charmscheck.com website manages and maintains character sheets, inventories, and is constructing a comprehensive compendium. This extension links the compendium and character tools on charmscheck.com to roll20. \n\nPlayers will create their characters on charmscheck.com. Then, they will install this extension and load roll20. A window (called an iframe) will appear on the left side of the screen that loads a specially developed page just for this extension. Players then navigate to their character using the  \"search all characters\" link. Once they load their character, a condensed character sheet with roll values will appear. Clicking the buttons on the charmscheck.com webpage (within the iframe) will roll a die, conduct all the math to determine bonuses and penalties, then post the result to roll20s chat box. \n\nThe roll20 extension does not work on any other websites and will not load in any other environment other than on roll20.net.\n\nThis latest version fixes some bugs related to window resizing."
