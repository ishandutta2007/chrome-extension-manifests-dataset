Once eliminated, opposing snakes will release additional pellets, allowing the surviving players to become even larger and stronger.\n\nThe game features vibrant and colorful graphics, creating an immersive and visually engaging experience. Various skins and customization options are often available, allowing players to personalize their snake's appearance and stand out among the competition.\n\nWith simple yet challenging gameplay, Snake.io delivers fast-paced and thrilling multiplayer action that appeals to both casual gamers and enthusiasts alike.
