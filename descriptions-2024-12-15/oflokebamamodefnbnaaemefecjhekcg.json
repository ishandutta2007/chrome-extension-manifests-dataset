Thanks. ***\n\n\nNIGHT MODE for all html based websites. It basically darkens websites backgrounds and turns other elements (mostly texts) into easy readable color. If you right-click on extensions button with your mouse you will see a couple of options. \n\nWhen you switch anything in the menu (it will appear when you right click on extension button) preferences will be stored for the website you are currently on. You can save this setting as default by choosing appropriate menu option. The default will be used then for every website that doesn't have stored settings. You can clear stored settings if you don't to have it there.\n\nReload page after modifying settings to see the changes.\n\nFeatures:\n- makes all websites darker and colorizes text\n- doesn't affect pictures and videos\n- allows you to set NIGHT MODE and adjust settings for particular domains\n\nPlease be aware of the development stage at this point. Some changes in menu options may require to turn on and off NIGHT MODE or sometimes full reload of the webpage. Extension uses your browser storage to save your preferences which means that if you visit website and use menu to change an option the webpage domain (e.g. 'youtube.com', 'twitter.com' etc.) will be registered. It's not encrypted (yet) but hidden a little bit so your mom won't read it unless she is a clever hacker ;). Stored settings for particular website is indicated by small 's' letter on extension button.\n\n\nIf you set 'Dim More' option extension tries to use more aggressive way to darken backgrounds which can help if some elements don't dim (yet you want them to) but also can make some elements invisible in a few cases. Just try to see if it suits you.\n'Dim Levels' menu allows you to set full blackout for background, if you chose \"Dim to Full Black\" or just partial dim. If you set 'or pick Dim Level:' then the number below are applied. Changing this needs to reset colors by turning NIGHT MODE on and off or reload webpage.\n\n\nPermissions description:\n- 'Allow access to file URLs'\nThis permission is not necessary if you don't open websites (.html files) from your local disk or if you don't care if plugin can operate on them.\n- 'Allow in private mode'\nThe same goes for this permission: if you don't like to let Website Dimmer work in Private Mode this is not required.\n- 'Storage'\nStores 'per domain' preferences."
