Our encoding extension makes sure your voice is heard, even in the face of potential censorship.\n\nKey Features:\n• Auto-Encoding: Seamlessly encodes your comments as you type, providing an extra layer of protection for your thoughts and opinions.\n• Manual Encoding: Highlight any text and use the right-click menu to encode specific portions of your message.\n• Smart Decoding: Automatically decodes encoded messages from other Truthy users, allowing for clear communication within the community.\n• Cross-Platform Support: Currently works on YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram and many other social media platforms.\n\nHow It Works:\nWhen you post a comment, Truthy briefly processes your text, encoding it in a way that may appear unusual to non-users but remains perfectly readable to fellow Truthy users.

We believe in the fundamental right to share ideas openly and access information without boundaries. By making it more challenging for restrictive entities to silence voices, Truthy empowers users to engage in meaningful dialogue and exchange ideas freely.\n\nJoin the Movement:\nBe part of a growing community dedicated to preserving the free exchange of information. With Truthy, your voice remains strong, clear, and unmuted across supported platforms.\n\n\nTruthy - Encoding Freedom, Decoding Truth."
