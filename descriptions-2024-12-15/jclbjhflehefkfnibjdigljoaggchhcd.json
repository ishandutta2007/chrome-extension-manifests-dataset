It's perfect for anyone who needs to open a bunch of links at the same time.\n\nHere are the features:\n\n1. Open URLs:\nPop in a bunch of links, and voilà – they all open together. Super handy for when you've got a list of sites to check out.\n\n2. History:\nThe extension keeps a history of previously opened URLs. This is super helpful if you want to reopen those links later without having to remember or find them again.\n\n3. Settings:\n• Lazy Load: Only loads a URL when you focus on its tab, keeping things smooth and your computer happy.\n• Random Order: Randomizes the order of opening your links, great for when you need a random sequence.\n• Appearance: Choose between a light or dark theme for the extension, or set it to 'auto' to match your system's theme. This makes the extension more comfortable to use and fits your personal style.\n\nAs an open-source project, all contributions to improve and enhance this extension are welcome.\n\nIn short, the Bulk URL Opener is a simple, user-friendly extension that's all about making your browsing a bit more convenient and a little less cluttered."
