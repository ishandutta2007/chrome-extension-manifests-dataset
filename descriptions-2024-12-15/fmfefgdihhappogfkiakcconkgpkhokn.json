You also can add random Item with name, type and optional URL of some item that you might try.\nIf you don't want some of the lists like say books you can disable a tab for that.\n\nThe tool is useful to quickly add items to your list, even for some time only, before you decide to go ahead with it. May be you are reading some article suggesting some books or movies then you can just add that suggestion to your corresponding list. You can remove items from the list once you have decided what to do with it.\n\nThe books list could be the books you want to read or investigate before adding to your list; movies could be movies you want to download, watch or investigate; music list could some of the songs you were suggested and you want to try those sometime; and Miscellaneous items could be items you want to investigate or buy someday. \n\nThe tool frees you from going to different sites for your different wishlists."
