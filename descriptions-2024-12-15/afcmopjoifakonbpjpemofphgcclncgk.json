The red line represents the whole hours, the yellow lines 6, 12 and 18. The background of this element changes slowly to random colours.\nThe main time hand is the green hand, moving to the right. \nBelow it, the white horizontal bar shows sunrise and sunset.\nBelow it, the green horizontal bar shows moonrise and moonset.\nBelow it, the indicator moving from right to left shows the quarter hour relative to the green indicator, like a magnifying glass for the top segment.\nAt the bottom is a second hand. The coincidence of the lines indicates the exact second. This was inspired by the division of the vernier. The lower division is fixed at 60 divisions, the upper one moves to the right, both also randomly changing colour."
