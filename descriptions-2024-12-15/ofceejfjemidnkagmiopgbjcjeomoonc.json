This extension allows you to right-click on any* image, choose \"Copy image as [IMG]\", and a BBcode-compatible [IMG] tag will be automatically copied to your clipboard. Simply paste that into the reply window on most forums and the image will be embedded into your reply. (Some sites have copy-protection code in place that will prevent this extension from working. This extension is not designed to circumvent any such measures.)\n\nYour privacy is important, so this extension doesn't use any tracking whatsoever. It can't see anything in your browser except images that you copy as [IMG] tags. No statistics or image data is sent back to any central server. However, I would really appreciate it if you'd leave a comment or review if this extension has helped you out."
