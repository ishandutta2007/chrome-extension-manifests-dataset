Most of the time its either useless garbage or stolen content but Facebook doesn't care and tries to ram it down your throat anyways.\n\nThe purpose of this extension is simple: hide all videos by default. You then have the option to manually unhide it after looking at who posted it or the post message.\n\nBy requiring this extra step you will find yourself watching much less terrible content as you must make the cognitive choice to view it. No flashy thumbnails to get you to mindlessly click the video and then a minute and a half later wonder why you just watched another useless life hack video. \n\nI really don't think you'll miss having sponsored videos every 3 posts.\n\n** NOTE **\n\nI've only tested this on my Facebook account. Facebook pushes updates daily and some users may be on different versions of the site so this extension may not work for you. If so, please let me know and I'll try to fix it."
