In addition, WriterWatch displays the follower count of an author as well as the current ABSR of each book.  Every twenty four hours, WriterWatch checks for updates on Amazon - and adds an alert to your toolbar in Chrome if a change is found.\n\nWith Writer Watch, you:\n- Always know the number of followers on Amazon\n- Know the ABSR of all tracked books\n- Save time from regularly checking books\n- Notice changes quickly so you can take the necessary action\n- Donâ€™t miss out on price opportunities\n- Can react to negative reviews\n- See new positive reviews as they arrive in the store\n\nWriter Watch also helps authors fight back against Amazon spammers, who can hijack books and change the price.  You can read more about how that particular spam occurs here: https://kindlepreneur.com/amazon-printing-scams/\n\nWriter Watch Limitations:\n\nWriter Watch is limited to 50 books per author for the time being because the more users and books we have, the higher the operational costs will go up. However, it is our goal to keep this Writer Watch free - this way, more authors will be able to use it and see if/when they are scammed.\n\nThe faster an author picks up on scammers, the sooner they can stop them, and thus the less profitable it becomes for the scammers. If this happens enough, scammers will give up.  By limiting to 5 books, we are able to serve more authors in this fight against spammers.\n\nAt the moment, Writer Watch is only available for Amazon US.  We're investigating how to make it available for international markets, but wanted to make Writer Watch available as fast as possible to help authors fight against spammers.  Stay tuned... we're excited to hopefully offer international options in the future.\n\nIf you are in another market besides the United States, and want to use WriterWatch, send us an email."
