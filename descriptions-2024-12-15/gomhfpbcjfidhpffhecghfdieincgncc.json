This guides the eye over the text and the brain remembers previously learned words more quickly.  \n\nThis extension is 100% free and open source, and you may find the source code here: https://github.com/Cveinnt/bionify. \n\nAs Bionify is open source and free, it is NOT associated with the paid Bionic ReadingÂ® APIs. We use our own highlighting algorithms and do not violate their copyrights. If this extension helped you, feel free to leave a star!\n\nPlease note that the extension currently don't support any kind of locally uploaded contents, such as PDFs. \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n* Pin the Bionify extension to your Chrome extension bar\n* Go the the public website you want to read\n* Click on the extension icon\n* Click on the toggle button to start reading with Bionic Reader!\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to submit an issue on the GitHub repo. This is in early development and improvements, features, and fixes will be soon to come!"
