The default settings use Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time). If you want to change these settings to other preprogrammed techniques (like 20-20-20 or 50-10) or design your own custom technique, just click on the Break helper icon and inside the popup click \"Preferences\". You will be redirected to a Options page where you can set your configuration.\n\nTo check how much time is left until the next break simply click on Break helper icon and inside the popup you will find a timer that tells you how much time is left until the next break.\n\nUpdates:\nUpdate 1.6.3: Fixed playing sound when break is finished\n\nUpdate 1.6: Added back \"Take a break\" and \"Skip this break\" buttons, added countdown timers displaying break duration to the break notification, fixed playing break notification sound.\n\nUpdate 1.4: Added \"Stop timer\", changed notification sound to a louder one, added a timer on the extension button\n\nUpdate 1.3.1: Fixed notification appearance in Windows 7.\n\nUpdate 1.3: timer reset and time left until next break functionality was added. Minor bugs were fixed.\n\nUpdate 1.2: audio notification when break ends and Pomodoro technique were added.\n\nUpdate 1.1: a timer was added to the notifications for easier break duration tracking\n\nUpdate 1.0: we have two rules you can choose from:\n1) 20-20-20, which is \"Every 20 minutes look at an object at least 20 feet (~6 meters) away for 20 seconds\". \n2) 50-10, which is \"Work for 50 minutes, take a break for 10 minutes\"\n\nIf you have any problems, suggestions or just want to contact me, please email me at \"breakhelper (at) tautvidas.com\". I will do my best to help you.\n\nMore updates are coming soon, stay tuned :)"
