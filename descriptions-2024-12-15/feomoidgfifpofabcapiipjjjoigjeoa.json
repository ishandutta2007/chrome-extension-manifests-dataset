You write a question for the LLM, select it, and ask it.\n\nAfter installing the extension, configure it by clicking on its icon, and following the instructions. \n\nFull instructions on the plugin's website - https://github.com/bThink-BGU/LeafLLM\n\nConfiguration\n**************\nThe plugin can be configured by clicking the plugin button in the Chrome toolbar.\nIt requires inserting an API key from OpenAI.\nYou also need to choose which tools you wish to enable. See below if you have problems using the tools.\n\nUsage\n*******\nAfter selecting text, press:\n- Alt+A to ask the LLM\n- Alt+C to complete the selected text\n- Alt+I to improve the selected text\n\nSee usage examples at: https://github.com/bThink-BGU/LeafLLM?tab=readme-ov-file#usage\n\nIssues\n*******\nIf nothing happens when you use the plugin, verify that the plugin's shortcuts are not in conflict with other plugins' shortcuts. To do so, go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts.\n\nIf you encounter any problem/question, please open an issue in the project's repository.\n\nPrivacy\n********\nThe plugin saves its configuration locally on the user's computer. The plugin sends the API key and the selected text to OpenAI only, and only for the purpose it was made for (i.e., completing and improving text and asking GPT questions). The plugin's authors are not responsible for what OpenAI does with this data. The plugin's authors do not collect any data from the plugin's users."
