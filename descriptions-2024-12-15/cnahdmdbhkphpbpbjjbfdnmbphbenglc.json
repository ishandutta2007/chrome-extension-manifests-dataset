Every injection is an application developed and audited by the Mutable Web community. A set of applications forms a mutation that works within a particular site and determines how it can be modified \n\nThe project follows the ethics of free public blockchains where the open community verifies and provides the development and audit. At the same time, the User is free to select any Mutation to run based on their audit status and maturity or disable them. The project is based on NEAR BOS technology, which provides a new way to store and access the web frontend.\n\nMutable Web requires read and write permissions to any website to augment it. You can always verify the source code or rely on the audit status set by auditors you trust.\n\nYou will find the source code of the Extension on GitHub: https://github.com/dapplets/mutable-web-monorepo"
