All courses have between 4.5 and 4.9 stars,\" and they really do, but not all courses are that great, that's where Coursera Advisor comes in, with a single click you will know if the course is worth your time and effort, just check the new rating in parentheses with the Coursera Advisor logo to the left of the Coursera original score.\n\nYou can use it anywhere where you see ⭐ star ratings ⭐ in Coursera, like course or specialization landing pages, search results, etc.\n\nWant to contribute?\nJoin the fun at https://github.com/MatiasAgelvis/CourseraAdvisor"
