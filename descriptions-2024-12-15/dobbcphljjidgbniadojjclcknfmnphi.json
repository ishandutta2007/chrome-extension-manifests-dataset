You can now right click on the Plugin icon and go to Options to choose which scans you want to use.\n\nToo many people are buying altcoin from the bsc network that are either rugpulls, honeypots, or have other red flags which would cause a concern that it's a scam.\n\nThis simple plugin will work from poocoin.app, bscscan.com, and moonarch.app. When you're viewing a token on one of those sites, simply click the Pooscan icon and it will open up each of the most common scanners for that particular token."
