The extension gathers information about images on every page and send it to Masala.AI's high performance content rating API  to identify and rate offensive content.  All this happens at near real time to give you an un-interrupted browsing experience while keeping the internet safe for your children.   The smart filter replaces any images containing explicit nudity as well as images with racy content including revealing clothing and provocative poses.  The sensitivity for the blocking behavior, including adult vs. racy content can be controlled in the settings page.  The extension also blocks images in popular search engines including Google, Bing for further safety in search sessions.\n\n‚ùÖ The extension is now only available for a nominal one time fee after your free trial period, to be able to cover the ongoing development & support costs. \n‚ùÖ Please note that the extension or the supporting Media Rating API technology does not store, record or analyze your personal data. The extension operates by intercepting images prior to loading in Chrome.  The intercepted images are analyzed in the cloud. Only publicly accessible URLs of images are sent to the Media Rating APIs. \n‚ùÖ If you would want to cancel your subscription and/or remove the extension . Please refer to the user guide in the extension's popup page.\n‚ùÖ If you have purchased the product before 05/18/2021, you are eligible for 1 year free subscription and requires no cancellation.\n‚ùÖ For any issues additional inquiries or refund requests, feel free to contact vRate Support at - opsus@masala.ai.\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY \nOur Privacy Policy is located at https://www.masala.one/about/privacy-policy/.  \n\nTERMS OF USE\nOur Terms of Use is located at https://www.masala.one/support/vrate-extension-terms-of-use/ \n\nUsers may occasionally see slower loading times of websites due to traffic on the cloud.   This is normal behavior and should automatically correct, however, if for any reason you believe the requests are being blocked for an abnormally long time, disabling & re-enabling the extension through the Chrome Extensions page should resolve the problem quickly.   \n\nWhile we apply the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence(AI) to deliver this service, current advancements are still short of comparable human accuracy.   However, we believe that these are first steps towards the application of AI and image analysis to keep the internet safe for our children.   In the fast changing internet of today, traditional techniques used by current internet filters are always a step behind.  This is because static blacklists need to be constantly updated.  Additionally seemingly innocuous websites like social networks, media sharing platforms, mixed-use websites, that are generally not blocked by blacklists also end up serving content that are sometimes not appropriate for children.  The vRate smart filter overcomes this problem by applying the same intelligent rules to every web page page that it sees.  Further, the Blacklists & Whitelists offered by the extension allows users to customize the filtering behavior by selectively specifying sites to block or allow, which overrides the default functionality.\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\nvRate applies the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to automatically determine obscene content without any manual intervention. However, like all services that depend on artificial intelligence, there is always a chance of error associated with the final determination made by the computer system.  The current error rate ranges from 4% to 15% and is largely dependent on the quality of the image and context.  Additionally, vRate applies several other rules to identify inappropriate content to ensure the maximum possible accuracy, but there is no guarantee of 100% accuracy and the possibilities of errors exist.   vRate browser extension currently analyzes only images and replaces inappropriate ones with a warning image. A wide range of image formats are supported, but streaming videos, flash content, display ads and other media content that do not render as a supported image are not analyzed and will be displayed as is.   Feature requests or issues can be reported at info@vrate.net.  By the use of this extension, you agree that you have read this disclosure and Our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documentation."
