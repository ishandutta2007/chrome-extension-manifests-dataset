This is not only inconvenient, but also boring if all you’re listening to is notched masking audio or the same songs over and over.\n\nFor these reasons it’s very hard to create a routine or habit around notch therapy, which is why I believe few people see any results from it. \n\nー This extension makes it easier! ー\n\nAfter installing this extension, your frequency will always be removed from any audio you hear, even when the popup menu is closed!\n\nWhether you’re watching a YouTube video or scrolling on Facebook, you’ll still be getting notch therapy. \n\nI hope this makes notch therapy a lot less boring for you, and easier to make a habit of!\n\nー Please note ー\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial, this extension will require a monthly subscription to continue using it.\n\nー Talk to me! ー\n\nHave any questions, problems, or feedback, please let me know! \nMy email is sam@samfaber.dev"
