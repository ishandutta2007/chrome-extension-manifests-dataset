If the issue persists, I'll be more than happy to help you, just send me an email :)\n----\nIf you have any questions, requests or just want to say \"Hi\", here is my email: ilyas[at]amezouar.com\n------\nOf course, instead of the cute üê∂ and üê± you'll see the video of the participants.\nThe photos have been taken by the talented: @yoadsh, @muzaluiza, @madhatterzone, @karsten116, @plhnk and @qrupt from Unsplash."
