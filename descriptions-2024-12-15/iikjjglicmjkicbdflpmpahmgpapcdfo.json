You need to watch atleast 2 episode for a series to be considered.\n\nThe project is open Sourced and can be found here :\nhttps://github.com/mightomi/TrackEm-Chrome-Extension\n\nIf by chance a Series isn't showing in the extension popup you can mail that URL at dev.mightomi@gmail.com . I will work on it asap."
