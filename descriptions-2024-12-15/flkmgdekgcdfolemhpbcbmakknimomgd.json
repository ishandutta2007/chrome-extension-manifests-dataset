Together, the community uses $FILM to vote & decide how cineDAO will fund future community projects, support independent filmmakers & select charities…(just to name a few).\n\nYou can use your $FILM to help steer the DAO or sell in on various marketplaces.\n\nOur community raises money by anonymously contributing the shows we’re watching to our community-owned dataset. Together, we form data unions and sell on public marketplaces. cineDAO automatically redistributes the revenue right back into the community!\n\nStay tuned, we are releasing new ways to earn even more $FILM soon!"
