It is perfect for anyone that wants to be well versed about the people, places, and subjects that are being written about on your favorite (or not so favorite) websites.\n\nWikifY will automatically scan news and reference sites for the presence of Wikipedia titles as you browse based on our list of news and reference sites or the preferences you have set. To scan or not to scan is up to you.  After the page is scanned and the WikifY icon is green, the Wikipedia title text on the site you are viewing turns into a trigger that will show a pop up of the titleâ€™s Wikipedia page when you hover over it.\n\nData Use:\nWhen a domain is scanned, WikifY will securely send web page text to our servers to compare against the millions of Wikipedia titles. The text may be stored for troubleshooting and optimization in a completely anonymized fashion. By default WikifY has access to all pages you visit, but only news and reference sites are scanned unless you choose to change the default for the page domain by clicking the extension icon in the upper left hand corner of chrome."
