This extension brings John Conway's famous cellular automaton to life, offering a blend of science, mathematics, and captivating visual patterns.\n\nüî¨ What is the Game of Life?\nConway's Game of Life is not just a game, but a zero-player simulation that demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules. Watch as cells live, die, and evolve based on their neighbors, creating intricate designs and behaviors that mimic real-world phenomena.\n\nüöÄ Key Features:\n‚Ä¢ Interactive Grid: Click to toggle cells on or off, creating your own initial patterns.\n‚Ä¢ Simulation Controls: Start, pause, and step through generations at your own pace.\n‚Ä¢ Randomize: Generate random patterns with a single click for endless exploration.\n‚Ä¢ Clear Board: Wipe the slate clean to start fresh anytime.\n‚Ä¢ Customizable Themes: Personalize your viewing experience with various color schemes.\n\nüß† Why Use This Extension?\n1. Educational Tool: Perfect for students and educators in computer science, mathematics, and biology to visualize concepts like emergent behavior and complex systems.\n2. Relaxation and Meditation: The hypnotic patterns can serve as a calming, focus-enhancing background.\n3. Spark Creativity: Use evolving patterns as inspiration for art, music, or problem-solving.\n4. Explore Computational Theory: Witness Turing completeness in action and understand fundamental principles of computation.\n5. Fun Experimentation: Create your own patterns and see how they evolve over time.\n\nüîç How It Works:\nThe Game of Life follows simple rules:\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nWatch as these simple rules give rise to complex behaviors like still lifes, oscillators, and gliders!\n\nüé® Customization:\nTailor your experience with multiple theme options. Whether you prefer a classic look or something more vibrant, there's a theme for every taste.\n\nüí° Did You Know?\nThe Game of Life has applications in various fields, including:\n‚Ä¢ Computer processors and Turing machines\n‚Ä¢ Artificial life and evolutionary computation\n‚Ä¢ Cellular automaton physics\n‚Ä¢ Socioeconomic modeling and urban planning\n\nInstall now and start your journey into the captivating world of Conway's Game of Life. Whether you're a student, educator, programmer, or just curious about complex systems, this extension offers endless fascination and learning opportunities.\n\nExplore, experiment, and enjoy the beauty of emergent complexity ‚Äì all within a click in your browser!\n\nNote: This extension uses the 'storage' permission solely to save your theme preference, ensuring your personalized experience persists between sessions."
