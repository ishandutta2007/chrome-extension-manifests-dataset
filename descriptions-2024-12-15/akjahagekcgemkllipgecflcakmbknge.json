This information could be a research article, a YouTube video etc. and the user is in control on what they allow Xibon AI's extension to access. Whether they are conducting research, managing complex projects, or simply browsing, Xibon AI ensures they never lose track of critical insights and ideas. The goal is to empower users to interact with content online while not having the pressure of remembering everything they have come across and giving them the confidence that their 'SuperBrain' will not only remember information they have interacted with online but also make cognitive connections between content and let users leverage such information for solving tasks/generating personalised documentation (technical documentation, learning notes, PRDs etc.). We want to build a true AI knowledge companion for our users whereby, it is a super personalised AI that truly understands the users needs and requirements as a knowledge worker. \n\nKey Features:\n\nAutomated Summarisation & Personalised Documentation:\n\nXibon AI automatically captures key information from the content you are interacting with online. It intelligently summarises articles, extracts important points, and enables users to create different types of documentation that is specifically catered towards the user so users can focus on other tasks without manual data entry.\n\nPersonalised Knowledge Base:\n\nAll the documents saved by users and the online information they have given access to Xibon AI to collect/summarise are organised in a highly intuitive, personalised knowledge base. This is why at Xibon AI we call the SuperBrain as a highly contextual personalised knowledge companion. Xibon AI utilises advanced graph databases to link related information, making it easy to retrieve and connect concepts whenever you need them.\n\nLearning/Project Completion Suggestions:\n\nBased on user inputs, our Learning Suggestion feature gives them some relevant links, why these links are important for their learning journey/project and a project plan along with it. \n\nSmart Content Retrieval:\n\nWith Xibon AI, finding the information you need is faster than ever. Use natural language queries to retrieve relevant data, whether it’s from yesterday’s research or something you noted down months ago using your 'SuperBrain'.\n\nProactive Insights:\n\nXibon AI offers tailored suggestions, proactive insights and additional resources (when the Proactive Insights button is switched on either in the extension or on the web app) to deepen users' understanding of new topics. The Proactive Insights feature allows users to get notifications on older information they recorded with the 'SuperBrain' that relates to what they are reading. researching etc. right now. We learn better by making connections with information we already have to learn new things so this is the vision behind proactive insights. It’s like having a personal tutor that remembers your learning journey and provides contextually relevant advice.\n\nPrivacy and Security:\nUser data security is our top priority. Xibon AI ensures that all user data is transmitted and stored using the latest encryption standards.\n\nWhy Install Xibon AI?\n\nBuild your Personalised Knowledge Companion: As you evolve your personalised knowledge companion/'SuperBrain' evolves with you and understands exactly what you require at a given point of time. \n\nNo more Information Overload or FOMO on important info: Interact with different types of content online with the confidence of knowing that your SuperBrain will allow you to leverage information later for what you need. \n\nStay Organised: Never lose track of important information again. Xibon AI organises your digital life, so you can retrieve your thoughts and ideas with ease.\n\nBoost Productivity: Automate mundane tasks like note-taking and data retrieval, freeing up your time to focus on what really matters.\n\nImprove Learning: Get the most out of your online research with personalised learning paths and intelligent suggestions."
