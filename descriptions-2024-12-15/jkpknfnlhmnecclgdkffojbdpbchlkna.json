It uses Chapter Language Filter from MangaDex user settings to decide which languages chapters to count. Theoretically there may be some rare cases where it gives a wrong value but I haven't encountered any yet.\n\nBe aware that this only displays the highest chapter number for the selected languages, it does not count the amount of chapters, so for example if there is a manga with only one uploaded chapter but its chapter number is 96 then this extension displays the number 96."
