Try Scrollbar Customizer! It's very easy, fast and you can change almost everything with the built-in editor!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: It is NOT possible to inject code to some Chrome™ specific sites like this Web Store, Chrome Settings, Chrome Extensions and other. Therefore it is NOT possible to customize scrollbars on these sites from this extension. Google™ has good reasons for this so as long as they are keeping up for these restrictions, we cannot offer our options on said sites.\n\nUpcoming Features:\n\n- more preset scrollbars\n- more customize options\n- injectible custom css codes\n- downloadable scrollbars\n\nWant more? Leave a comment with suggestions and we will try to implement it!\n\nIf you like Scrollbar Customizer, please rate us 5 Stars, give us a Plus 1 and share on Facebook!\n\nChrome™ is a trademark of Google Inc.
