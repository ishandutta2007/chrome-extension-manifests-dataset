The MAJIQ Wheel can be used individually when unsure about the answer of a multiple choice question. Or it can be used collectively with a group of friends when deciding the order of players in an online board game. \n\nUsers can select between answers of numerical or alphabetical format, and can select up to 4 options. For example, the user can select the alphabetical format and the following options: second, third, fourth. When the user presses the spin button, the MAJIQ Wheel will update its display to randomly select between values: b, c, d. \n\nUsers spend most of their time online, whether that's to play games or to write exams. The MAJIQ Wheel, as a Chrome extension, gives the user convenient access to a randomizer tool that can be applied to a multitude of online tasks."
