Research has shown that antivirus applications only detect about 20% of modern malware.\n\nLanding on a compromised server means risking downloading malware that logs your keystrokes, steals your passwords and credit card data, encrypts your files and then demands a ransom, sends junk email to your contacts or turns your PC into a bot (an automated device used to attack other PCs or servers).\n\nEvery time you browse you take unknowing risks if you browse unprotected. SafeBrowser is a highly innovative, patent pending new service that allows you to view the smaller less well known sites in a protected way, with all scripts, applets, flash and activex controls removed and reported on.\n\nSafeBrowser not only tells you the category and reputation of the website you are viewing, but the category and reputation of the 3rd party servers and redirected servers the sites pages are also accessing. Sometimes its these 3rd party servers that are the source of the malware. SafeBrowser is the only service in the world that can do this.\n\nShortened URLs such as bit.ly and goo.gl have their uses, but they're also a malware author's dream. It's estimated that one in five of the pages behind these shortened URLs have viruses or other malware just waiting to download onto your computer. \n\nSafeBrowser protects your computer because it does all redirection on the server, loads the final redirected page, strips it of anything that could cause harm*, and sends the safe version to your browser. \n\nOnce you are satisfied that you are on the site you expected to be, you can always then choose to view that page in a normal browser window.\n\nPlease be aware that some sites may not display properly or even display at all if they are heavily dependent on javascript, but you can still check these sites reputation and category before deciding whether to view them in a normal browser window. 99% of sites however display just fine.\n\n* SafeBrowser cannot detect viruses in images so you still need a good antivirus application to help detect these\n\nSafeBrowser does not record your browsing history, and allows you to browser privately and anonymously to the sites you visit with it.\n\nSafeBrowser offers a free 50MB per month trial option, or higher browsing limits are available with the pro options."
