Unfortunately, the Other Bookmarks menu puts newly added bookmarks at the bottom of the list, meaning lots of scrolling or having to open the Bookmark Manager.\n\nRecent Bookmarks solves this by displaying a simple and elegant list of the most recent bookmarks you've made.  It groups the bookmarks based on the days they were added. Hovering over a bookmark will show the exact date and time it was added.\n\nThe extension can be configured to display between 5 and 1000 of your most recent bookmarks.\n\n1.6.2: Popup closes when a link is opened.\n1.6: Faster load times!\n1.5: Added ability to delete bookmarks (with keyboard support).\n1.4.5: Added improved favicon support.\n1.4: Added fewer required permissions, up to 1000 bookmarks can now be displayed (see options), and \"Recent Bookmarks Manager\" shortcut (see options to toggle).\n1.3: Added bookmarklet support.\n1.2: Added keyboard navigation.\n1.1: Added support for blank page titles."
