Thanks to the WebRTC technology, when you use it to chat with someone else, your messages arenâ€™t sent to a centralized server but rather sent directly to the recipients, or at worst sent (but first encrypted) via a TURN server.\nIt's like P2P, but only with instant messages.\n\nThe channel-system is managed to connect you with other viewers of the active webpage in your browser. \n\nNebulo can be setting to work with other signaling system, you can select authorized STUN and TURN servers at the options page, ...\n\nDefault signal server will be shutdown at the end of October 2015, so you must be prepared to use your own signal server after this date. A tutorial to do this is now linked in the option page."
