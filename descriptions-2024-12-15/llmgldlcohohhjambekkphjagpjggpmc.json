Occasionally debilitating and lowering the desire to continue reading the same topic.\n\nSpace to next page was developed to resolve this issue, it works like this:\n- The user usually presses the spacebar to scroll down the page.\n- When the user reaches the bottom of the page and presses the space bar, automatically the next page of the same topic. Etc. until the last page on the same topic.\n\nAll without touching the mouse at all.\n\nIn addition, if the user wants to pause the next page by pressing the space bar, click the extension icon (the red icon will appear), To activate, click  on the extension icon (the green icon will appear again).\n\n\nSuggestions, improvements, problems, please email: alik.solutions@outlook.com"
