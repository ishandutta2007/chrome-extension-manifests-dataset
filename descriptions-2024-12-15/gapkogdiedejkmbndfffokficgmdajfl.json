This tool aids in identifying potential candidates on Smart Recruiter that match an individual on an active NYC Civil Service list.\nThe extension matches candidates based on their first and last names to active Civil Service lists. This feature allows hiring managers to quickly identify potential matches with Civil Service titles.\nAs you navigate the Smart Recruiter site and view current positions and candidates, the extension automatically scans for candidates. It then cross-references these names with the active Civil Service lists.\nThe extension uses a matching algorithm to find potential matches between the candidates' first and last names in SmartRecruiter.com and the names on the active Civil Service lists. This feature allows recruiters to quickly identify potential matches without having to manually cross-reference the information themselves.\nIf the extension finds any matches, it brings that data forward so it can be displayed directly within the Smart Recruiter platform. This allows you to see the matched Civil Service list information without leaving the Smart Recruiter platform.\nIf more matches are found, you will see a list of titles, each with its own information. Just expand to see the detail.\nWhile the extension provides a helpful starting point, it's crucial to perform additional checks to confirm the candidate is a match. The extension matches based on names only, and there may be multiple individuals with the same name.\nThe extension checks against the active Civil Service list. If a candidate does not appear as a match, it doesn't necessarily mean they're not in a Civil Service position. They could already hold a title and be working in a private or city entity.\nThis extension may collect information automatically about the way you use it and errors that occur. This information is used to monitor the performance of the Application and to identify and troubleshoot errors. This information does not include any personal identification information and is used solely for the purpose of ensuring the Application is working as expected."
