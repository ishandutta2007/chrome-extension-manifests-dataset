This extension is simple. It hides possible spoilers on Facebook and Twitter. Some of them may not be spoilers but hey, better safe than sorry, right?\n\nYou can still see the content behind the spoiler by clicking on it.\n\nThis is still work in progress and future versions will prevent spoilers for other famous TV shows.\n\nFeedback is welcomed."
