Use a proxy! Users with an account at ValeVPN get access to our ValePRXY network with this Chrome Extension.  \n\nValeVPN is the ONLY provider of fully dedicated, one-time-use secure VPN servers online. Many VPN providers claim to have the fastest service, but none of them provide a fully dedicated server in the largest cloud networks worldwide.\n\nWhy is ValeVPN the best choice as your VPN provider? Here’s why:\n\n✔ SPEED\nWe don’t maintain servers - we leverage the largest cloud infrastructures in the world. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all have huge, ultra fast networks. We don’t just use their system, we create a FULLY DEDICATED, SINGLE USE SERVER for you to use. There is no way any of the other providers can compete with that type of speed.\n\n✔ PRIVACY\nSharing your server means sharing your data. Like it or not current ‘shared VPN’ servers are stuffing as many people onto a single big server as they can. This means that your private activity is easy to track to a single server IP & URL. ValeVPN solves this, as your server doesn’t even exist. Then it does. Then it is destroyed.\n\n✔ SECURITY\nAgain, current VPN providers claim their servers are secure, but they are like fish in barrel. They have static servers sitting in static data centers around the world just waiting for zero-day exploits that can lead to compromised security for your connection. ValeVPN has fully updated, single-use servers that are instantly patched. You connect, you use it, and you destroy it.\n\n✔ UNBLOCKABLE\nIf you have a static server with a static URL it is easy to block. Many users complain that they cannot access media and videos while traveling because providers know the server IP and URL of the VPN provider. ValeVPN solves this problem by creating fully dynamic and never static, dedicated servers. It is impossible to block these for two reasons: The servers don’t exist AND media providers would be blocking their own infrastructure!\n\nDownload ValeVPN today and get the fastest and most secure internet connection to a dedicated cloud infrastructure possible. For quick connections we also offer our subscribers 'Shared' servers, but we limit the per-user-server count to ensure you aren't slowed or kicked off.\n\nOne tap is all it takes to launch your dedicated cloud security server on a blazing fast infrastructure today.\n\nPrivacy is important to the team at ValeVPN, so ValeVPN has a strict ‘no-logs’ policy - we simply launch and connect you to your dedicated security server.
