Or are you reading it a second or third time and it feels like something changed? A lot of times, we are just curious when exactly was a page updated. If we need it for our professional work or just out of curiosity. Last Update Checker lets you do exactly, what it name is! This extension is still in an alpha state of the development and the only thing it does now is scanning the OpenGraph protocol inside a website's code. Other functionalities will arrive soon.\n\nIf you want to speed up the process or just think that this tool is useful an I did a great job, I have a tip jar available: https://paypal.me/antonpernisch\n\nIn case of any questions, ideas or bug reports, you can message me via Chrome Extension page or email me at anton@pernisch.dev.\n\n\nStore icon was made by Freepik: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/loop"
