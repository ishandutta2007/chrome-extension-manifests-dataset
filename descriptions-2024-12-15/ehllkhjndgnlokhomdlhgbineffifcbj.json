This adjustment enhances the extension's performance, as the always-active feature can disrupt websites. To activate it, open the page requiring the always-active feature in a browser tab and click the action button once. The page will refresh, and the action button will turn blue.\n\n---\n\nThis extension protects against web pages tracking the activity state of the page. Some websites use this track to only offer services when the tab is active. By installing this extension a small script is injected into every webpage which overwrites the \"document.visibilityState\", and \"document.hidden\" properties to pretend the tab is always in the active state (document.visibilityState = 'visible' and document.hidden = false). \n\nThis is useful for the webpages that check your visibility state before loading resources like many music webpages. By installing this extension even if the page is opened in the background page, the player will start immediately like the page is loaded on an active tab. \n\nSupported Trackings:\ndocument.mozHidden (only on Firefox browser)\ndocument.webkitHidden (only on Chromium browsers)\n\nSupported Events:\n1. visibilitychange\n2. webkitvisibilitychange (only on Chromium browsers)\n3. mozvisibilitychange (only on Firefox browser)\n4. blur (some websites require the user to keep the tab focused)\n5. mouseleave (some websites use this method to make sure the user pointer is inside the window)"
