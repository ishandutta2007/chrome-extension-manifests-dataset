Applied to personal financial data, it can answer questions like:\n\n - Where did all my  money go?\n - When did I start shopping more at Trader Joe's than Vons?\n - How did I spend more on vacation this year than usual?\n\nBreakdown works by loading your Mint or Personal Capital data into Lovefield, the browser-based local database written in javascript by a team at Google.\n\nYour data stays on your machine.  \n\n\nStep 1:\n\nInstall the Chrome Extension.\n\nStep 2:\n\nIn Empower (formerly Personal Capital), go to Overview/Transactions, select All, and click the CSV button.\n\nSave the csv file to your hard drive.\n\nStep 3:\n\nA new tab will appear for Breakdown, thanks to the extension.  Click the big Import button.  Select the csv file you just downloaded.  \n\nThat's it!\n\nBreakdown relies on you to download data yourself and pass it on manually to Breakdown, which passes it on to Lovefield.  That sounds painful but it's only a few button clicks whenever you want the latest transactions.\n\nThere are no user accounts or logins because there is no interaction with any server.  All data is local.\n\nThe Lovefield database can be seen in the Chrome Developer Tools under the Applications tab, in IndexedDB and Local Storage.\n\nBreakdown:  \n  https://www.johndimm.com/breakdown/\n\nEmpower (formerly Personal Capital): \n  https://home.personalcapital.com/\n\nLovefield: \n  https://google.github.io/lovefield/"
