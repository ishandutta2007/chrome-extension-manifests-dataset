With the power of openAI and our advanced Machine Learning models, you can now easily understand the codebase of any GitHub repository related to C4rena competitions with ease.\n\n✨ Our unique algorithm is trained on all past exploits found in C4rena competitions, so you can trust it to quickly identify any vulnerabilities and related issues within the codebase. Simply type the function you want to monitor and include \"vulner\" into the chat and our system will automatically search through the code of the concerned function and return any vulnerabilities that may exist.\n\n💡 But that's not all! Our innovative system also includes advanced GPT-3 models to help answer any and all questions you may have related to the Solidity files in the codebase. With these powerful tools at your disposal, you can easily understand the codebase and uncover any potential vulnerabilities with ease.\n\n🕐 Say goodbye to the long hours spent manually reading through the codebase - our extension can handle it all in a fraction of the time. Download it now and see for yourself how much easier your auditing process can be with our advanced machine learning-powered tool."
