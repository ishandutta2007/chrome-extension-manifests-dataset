MuteMachine automatically skips over any songs users \"mute.\" \n\nMaybe you're not as into the new Lana Del Rey album as everyone else, or you've gotten a little bored of that song everyone has just gotten into. Once you click the mute button on a song, MuteMachine will automatically skip to the next song anytime that it tries to play on the HypeMachine. \n\nFor people who use the HypeMachine every day and as their primary source of music, this extension is a must have to make the experience a little more personal!"
