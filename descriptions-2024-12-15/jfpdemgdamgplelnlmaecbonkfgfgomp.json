(If it seems stuck for any reason, you can press the reload button located at the upper right.)\n- The filter can be easily used by simply typing (the input doesn't need to be focused beforehand)\n- You can filter by multiple arguments using a comma `,` as a delimiter (e.g., \"title, canonical\").\n- To display result options/actions, simply hover over its row.\n\nIf you find any bugs, please report them via GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/bluemoehre/chrome-meta-debugger\n\nThanks!"
