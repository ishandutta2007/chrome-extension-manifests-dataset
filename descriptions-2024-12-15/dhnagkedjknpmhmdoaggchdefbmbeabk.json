Tabs playing audio or video won't be put to sleep.\n\n=== Main Features===\n\nTabs are put to sleep when not in use for 10 minutes (the interval can be customized in the settings). \n \nTabs are put to sleep when system memory is low. The extension will set a default low memory threshold depending by the total amount of system memory. This value can be customized.\n\nThe extension will periodically check the amount of free system memory. This interval is set by default to 5 minutes and can be customized.\n\n========================= CHANGE LOG ============================= \n\nv.1.6 : support for V3 manifest and small bug fixes"
