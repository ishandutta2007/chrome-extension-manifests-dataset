Now you can! \n\nWe brought the most frequently used shortcuts to Sheets so you no longer need to click around Sheets to accomplish what you would’ve been able to do with a couple keystrokes in Excel.  \n\nNot an Excel junkie? That’s okay too! We’ve defaulted these shortcuts to native Excel, but with SheetWhiz you’re able to customize formatting shortcuts to whatever works best for you. Just click on the shortcut key to modify it\n\nExcel shortcuts are supported on both Mac and PC. ALT is replaced with Option on a Mac. CTRL on a PC maps to Control on a Mac (not Command)\n• For shortcuts starting with ALT, press and release all keys in the order listed\n• For shortcuts starting with CTRL, press all keys in the order listed and hold down until all keys have been pressed\n\n➤ Trace Precedents on Google Sheets: Get Your Formulas Right\n\n• See all the cells referenced in your formula in one window\n• Quickly jump to every precedent cell using the up / down arrow keys \n• Make spreadsheet edits without having to close the trace precedents window\n• Dive a layer deeper and view the precedents of the precedents cells from the same window without having to rerun the tool. The right arrow key opens and left arrow key closes each layer\n• Close the window by hitting \"Esc.\" Never need to touch your mouse!\n• Similar to the tracing precedents tools seen in plug-ins like Macabacus, Arixcel, Factset, and S&P Capital IQ on Excel\n\n➤ Trace Dependents on Google Sheets: Modify Your Sheet with Confidence\n\n• See all the cells that reference the cell that you’re on in one window\n• Navigate to every dependent cell using the up / down arrow keys\n• For large spreadsheets, you can run trace dependents on specific tabs to increase the speed of the tool vs. on the entire spreadsheet\n• Close the window by hitting \"Esc.\" Never need to touch your mouse!\n• Similar to the trace dependents tools seen in plug-ins like Macabacus, Arixcel, Factset, and S&P Capital IQ\n\n➤ Format Cycling: Be Faster on Google Sheets than Native Excel! \n\nTired of having to reformat negative numbers as (1) versus the Google Sheet default of -1.00? Need to color code numbers (e.g., Blue = Hard Code, Green = Link, Black = Formula)? Have company colors that you need to use but always need to import them into a Sheet?\n\nUse our format cycles that allow you to quickly flip through number formats, font colors, and cell fills that you define and keep your formatting consistent in every analysis you do\n\n➤ Export Selection as Image (Beta): Keep Your Cell Formatting When Exporting to Slides or Docs!\n\nEver need to export your analysis into Google Slides or Google Docs? Now you can quickly take a screenshot of your selection by hitting Ctrl + Shift + C. We are working on allowing the image to be updated once it has been pasted - stay tuned!\n\nOur Full List of Customizable Shortcuts: \n• Trace Precedents\n• Trace Dependents\n• Export Selection as Image (Beta)\n• Insert & Delete Columns \n• All Border Shortcuts (Remove, Bottom, Top, Left, Right, Outside, All, Inner, Horizontal, Vertical)\n• Auto-Fit Column Width\n• Auto-Fit Row Height\n• Set Column Width\n• Set Row Height\n• Align Center, Left, Right, Top Middle, Bottom\n• Increase & Reduce Decimals\n• Add & Remove Filters\n• Paste Special (Formula, Format, Value, Transposed, Column Width Only, All Except Borders)\n• Show / Hide Gridlines\n• Increase / Decrease Font Size\n• Set Font Size\n• Set Font\n• Freeze / Unfreeze Rows & Columns (including together at the same time!)\n• Merge / Unmerge\n• General Number Cycle\n• Percent Cycle\n• Local Currency Cycle\n• Multiples Cycle\n• Font Color Cycle\n• Cell Fill Cycle\n\nWhen you install SheetWhiz, you’ll automatically be enrolled in our 21-day free trial of our Pro plan. After the trial is over, you’ll automatically be converted to our Free plan, which includes all the key native Excel formatting shortcuts, with the option to upgrade if desired\n\nFinally, we know data privacy matters to you. There is no mechanism at SheetWhiz for us to see, edit, create, delete, or store any of the values in your spreadsheets or Google Drive files.
