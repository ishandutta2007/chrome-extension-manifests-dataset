I like the new responsive system, but find when I am using it I lose real estate on my screen. This is fine while I'm plugged into an external monitor. It becomes an issue when I'm on my laptop trying to maximize my screen space. This will simply put the pixel width and height for the real estate taken up by the screen into the upper right hand corner. I might create a config file to offer color and placement preferences in the future.\n\nHope you find this useful.\n\nFixed issue where fixed headers would hide the extension by raising z-index.\nFixed issue where sites inherited font-size and/or font-family was illegible."
