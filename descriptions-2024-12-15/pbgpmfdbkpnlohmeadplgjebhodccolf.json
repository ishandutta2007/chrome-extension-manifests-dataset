Once installed, you'll see small button in the top right corner when you go to any of our supported EHRs, this is used to open a sidebar that grants you access to information about your patients, including coding gaps, medications and claims. We currently support Medios EHR and Quanum EHR.\n\nThe extension integrates with your EHR by automatically searching for patient identifiers in the content you are viewing, once we detect a patient identifier, the identifier is used to search our patient database and present the result in your sidebar.\n\nNote that this extension is intended for Cisne customers only. This is an addition to our data analysis platform intended to make the results of our analysis available for physicians in their day to day job. A typical use case would be to reduce time spent looking for potential coding gaps that need to be addressed when a patient is visiting. We require you to login before you can access patient data."
