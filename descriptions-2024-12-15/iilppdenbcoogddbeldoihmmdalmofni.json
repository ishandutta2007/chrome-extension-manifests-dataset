Often their different posts will need to mention the same stakeholders or partner organisations over and over again and will often contain the same hashtags over and over again. If this is you, then Type-Paste-Post can save you time and hassle.\n\nWhat does Type-Paste-Post actually do?\nType-Paste-Post is a small window that appears over your Chrome browser when you click on its icon - the little time-saving piggy-bank icon! In that window you can type the text content of a social media post, include different pre-saved @mentions for different organisations and people with just the click of a button; include different pre-saved hashtags with just the click of a button; and, when you’re done, click on the social media platform that you want to paste your text in and publish to.\n\nAfter you have pasted the post to the first social media platform, just click the piggy-bank icon to open the Type-Paste-Post window again and click on another social media platform button - where you want to publish that same message to. Type-Paste-Post will automatically insert the correct pre-saved handles/usernames for your different @mentions, depending on the platform you are pasting to next. Repeat this quick process until you have posted the update to all your social media.\n\nI created Type-Paste-Post because I had the following problems:\nA) I found myself having to tediously re-type the same text for a social media post over and over again to post it to different social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nB) As I typed the post (again and again), I had to try to remember and find the relevant handle names for the other stakeholders I needed to @mention in the post.\n\nC) I often forgot to include certain #hashtags in my post and would then have to edit or delete and re-type the post in each of the different platforms.\n\nD) I would have an idea for a post, half-write it but then get distracted and never finish it. Then when I needed to come up with an idea for my next post, I wouldn’t be able to remember that first one!\n\nThe ‘Type-Paste-Post’ Google Chrome Extension tool solves all of these problems for me in an easy-to-use, intuitive way and has genuinely saved me time and hassle when it comes to posting on social media.\n\nHow much does it cost to use Type-Paste-Post?\nType-Paste-Post costs €5 per month to use (but there is a one-week free trial when you first subscribe to make sure you are happy with it). You buy your subscription to use Type-Past-Post via Gumroad.com. (The monthly charge on your payment method will appear as 'GUM CO' as it is processed by Gumroad.com.) When you no longer need the tool, you cancel your subscription (at any time) via the Gumroad platform and the tool stops working for you.\n\nThis low-cost monthly subscription approach was taken so that you only pay for the Type-Paste-Post tool for as long as you are saving time and getting value out of it. Once you no longer need or want to use Type-Paste-Post, then you stop paying for it.\n\nYou can buy a license key to use Type-Paste-Post here: https://typepastepost.gumroad.com/l/type-paste-post\n\nHow to get started using Type-Paste-Post?\n1. Download Type-Paste-Post from the Chrome Web Store available here and buy a monthly license (€5 per month) to use it here: https://typepastepost.gumroad.com/l/type-paste-post\n\n2. Once the extension is installed on you browser, click on it's icon (the little time-saving piggy-bank icon!) to enter your license key and the email address used to purchase that license key\n\n3. Pin the Type-Paste-Post extension to your Chrome browser’s task bar for convenience.\n\n4. Take five minutes the first time you use Type-Paste-Post to save some @mention handles and #hashtags for future use.\n\n- And away you go!\n\nI hope using Type-Paste-Post will help make your social media marketing less tedious, stressful and time-consuming.\n\n-Thanks, Colum (from Paper Juice Creative, developer of 'Type-Paste-Post)"
