Unfortunately, this means that my extension will no longer work since it hasn't been updated to meet the requirements of manifest v3.\n\nAfter giving it some thought, I've decided not to invest any more time in developing Chrome extensions. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, and I appreciate your trust in using my extension.\n\nThank you for your understanding and support.\n\nCheers,\n\nSander\n***\n\n\n\nThe command line interface for your browser.
