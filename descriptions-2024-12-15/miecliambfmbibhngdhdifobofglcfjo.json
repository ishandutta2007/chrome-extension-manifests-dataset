Any flight or journey to a more desirable or congenial place.\n\nHaving multiple people working on the same project is great because you always reach greater goals. On the other hand different people means different criteria and that translates to non consistent documentation, tickets, etc. Because people do not tend to follow the guidelines...\n\nThis extension allows you to add templates and validations to some forms before submit, to make sure there's only one criteria :)\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n-----------------\nThis plugin has no relation with Atlassian company. Is a tool developed by an independent developer\nto improve it's own workflow.\n\nThis plugin is a prototype and might be a little buggy. If you notice some wrong behaviour you only have to uninstall the extension and everything will work as always :)\n\n\nWhat is this plugin?\n------------------------\nThis plugin is a set of tools to improve developers and testers workflow using JIRA.\nRight now allows you to create validation and prefill forms for defect and sub-tasks.\n\n\nHow can I install?\n-----------------\nYou only have to go to the Chrome store and install the extension.\n\n\nHow does it work\n-----------------\nAdd event listeners to the environment and reacts according to the user \ndecisions.\n\n\nMore Information\n-----------------\n@xaviercolomer\nhttp://xavicolomer.com"
