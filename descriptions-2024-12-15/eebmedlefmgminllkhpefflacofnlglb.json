It's designed with accessibility in mind, making it perfect for people with disabilities who may struggle with repetitive manual tasks. Unlike ad-blockers, Skipper doesn't harm creators, platforms, or advertisers, and it's not intended to block ads.\n\nWhy choose Skipper?\n\nIf interacting with \"skip\" buttons is challenging due to a disability, you enjoy multitasking with YouTube in the background, or forced waiting times on ads annoy you, Skipper is a perfect choice.\n\nSupports creators\n\nSkipper doesn't take away ad revenue from creators or violate YouTube's terms of service. Instead, it uses your browser's built-in features to interact with websites just like a regular user, ensuring no harm to website owners, advertisers, or creators.\n\nAlways free and open-source\n\nSome extensions charge money or trick you into downloading before asking for payment. With Skipper, you won't have to worry about that. It's always free, open-source, and committed to user safety.\n\nReliable and well-supported\n\nSkipper is built with reliability in mind and was tested for over 100 hours before its public release. Our dedicated team of beta testers uses Skipper daily and continually improves it based on user feedback.\n\nSimple and easy to use\n\nSkipper is designed around simplicity. There's no setup required, it will never impact the speed of your computer, it's only allowed to run on supported websites and it doesn't require any additional downloads or configuration."
