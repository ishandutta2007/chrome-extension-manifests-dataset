This plugin reads data from an Asana list and allows you to keep only tasks that fulfill the filter criteria. Run it multiple times to filter all the way down.\n\nHow it works:\nReads Asana Spreadsheet data columns and deletes HTML rows on the front end. This does not change Asana data in any way. Refreshing the page brings everything back.\n\nKnown Issues:\nVersion 0.2.0\n- Shift clicking remaining tasks will select hidden tasks. Ctrl + Click works fine.\n- Only works on List view. I will eventually get it working on Board view, but my current needs are satisfied.\n- Sometimes \"Column\" dropdown doesn't populate. Click \"Refresh Lists\" to have plugin pull data from Asana.\n- Custom columns are fully supported. Assignee, Due Date, and other Asana native column names operate differently than custom columns and I don't necessarily need them to work at the moment."
