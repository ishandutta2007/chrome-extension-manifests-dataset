The extension supports two modes to deal with cookies:\n\n1. \"session\" mode: delete cookies once the current session is closed (all browser windows are closed).\n2. \"tabs\" mode: delete cookies related to the current tab once the tab is closed and there are no other tabs of the same domain.\n\nExample: Let's say you are logged-in into your email account:\nIn \"session\" mode, you will be logged-in until all browser tabs are closed.\nIn \"tabs\" mode, you will be logged-out once all email tabs are closed. So if you have two email tabs opened and still one tab is open, you are still logged-in. Once the other tab is closed, you will get logged-out\n\nNote: the extension does not support cleaning  \"window.localStorage\" at this moment. I will work on that later!\n\nTo report bugs please use the review section of the FAQs page"
