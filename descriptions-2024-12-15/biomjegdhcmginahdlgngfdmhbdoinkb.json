Designed to be a gentle yet effective companion, this beta version offers a range of tools aimed at reducing anxiety and stress, empowering users to push forward with renewed focus and determination.\n\nThis project is a personal endeavor, driven by the desire to create a resource that can truly make a difference in the lives of those facing mental challenges. As a graduate of UHV, my research delved deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, exploring how computers can be programmed to understand and process information in ways that mimic human cognition. JavaScript, a cornerstone of web development, played a pivotal role in my studies, particularly through my experimentation with neural networks using the Brain.js library.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that MotivateAI is not a substitute for professional medical advice. While we believe in the potential of technology to enhance mental well-being, it’s essential to seek guidance from qualified healthcare providers for any serious concerns about anxiety or stress.\n\nThis beta version represents the initial steps in our journey to develop a comprehensive mental health support tool. As we refine MotivateAI based on user feedback, we plan to incorporate more advanced AI features to provide even greater assistance. Our ultimate goal is to create a platform that fosters resilience, positivity, and overall mental balance.\n\nCurrent Features: \n- Vanilla Javascript \n- Type.fit API \n- Tailwind CSS\n\nFuture Updates: \n- AI Chatbot (w/ mental health focus utilizing Gemini/OpenAI API)"
