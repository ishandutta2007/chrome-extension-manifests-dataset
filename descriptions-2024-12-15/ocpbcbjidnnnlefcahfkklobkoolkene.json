Instead of seeing just a blank tab when you open a new tab, this extension replaces that page with a customized tab full of interesting features.\n\n\nFirstly, you will be greeted by real-time weather information. The extension uses your location to display the current weather conditions, keeping you informed about temperatures, forecasts, and general weather conditions. Whether you're planning a sunny day at the beach or preparing for a downpour, you'll always have access to this essential information.\n\n\nAdditionally, the custom tab also offers a selection of random background images to liven up your browsing experience. Every time you open a new tab, you will be greeted by a different and unique image, allowing you to discover stunning landscapes, beautiful artworks, or even inspiring photographs. These background images create a pleasant ambiance and provide a visual break in your day."
