An absolute limit on the duration of the browser session, after this time, the browser will be closed. Notifications warn of  pending shutdown.\n2. Show a notification on time interval, reminding you how much time you have spent online.\n\nAll the time limits can be configured, and a URL white-list is supported - when the active tab matches the white-list, features are disabled.\n\nNotes\n-----\nIf you decide to enable the feature to automatically close the browser, you might wish to enable persistence of the tabs:\n    Settings > On startup > \"continue where you left off\"\n    \nThis extension is supposed to be annoying -- the point of it is to distract you from mindless surfing!\n\nDefinitely an Alpha -- comments welcome!\n\nIcon credit to: http://www.cliparthut.com/xmas-candle-clipart.html\n\nBen Blamey\nben@benblamey.com"
