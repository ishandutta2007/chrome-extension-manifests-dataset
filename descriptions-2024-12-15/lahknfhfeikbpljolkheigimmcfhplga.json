Auto-skips those 5 second ads on YouTube: \nYouTube usually plays ads before the videos, and these ads have a countdown timer of around 5 seconds before the ad can be skipped using the \"Skip Ad\" button, which only appears after few seconds. This extension tries to skip the ad immediately and automatically for you, even before the ad countdown timer ends. This works when the ad is a \"skippable\" ad. \n2. Dismisses those annoying overlay ads that appear over the video at the bottom, with a remarkably small button to close them."
