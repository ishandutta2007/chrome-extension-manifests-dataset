Simply add it to your browser and start using it without any additional plugins. (1) load your file, (2) set a password, and (3) press on the encrypt/decrypt button. File Guard uses the new encryption API (WebCryptoAPI) which is built-in to your browser by default. If you want to encrypt a file, please first browser your file (drag & drop or use the file selector), then enter a password (2 times) and finally click on the - Encrypt - button. The add-on starts the encryption process and downloads the encrypted file to your machine automatically. Please do the same procedure for decryption purposes. \n\nNote: this addon is only designed for encrypting a \"single\" file. If you have a folder with multiple files or folders in it, please first \"compress\" your files to a single \".zip\" file and then encrypt the compressed file with this add-on. Please note that File Guard can encrypt any file format with any size.\n\nNote: if you forget the encryption password, you will not be able to recover (decrypt) your file with this add-on. Therefore, it is very important to keep your password in a safe place.\n\nIf you see any bug or have a feature request, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/file-encryptor.html)."
