(hence the name).  PubMonkey supports a number of header bidding / in-app bidding services. Please refer to the screenshot section to see the list of supported Header Bidding Services. \n\nFull list of features:\n✅ Export and Backup your orders configuration.\nIt exports order and all included line items settings to a JSON file so that you can store them locally and synchronize between your devices.\n\n✅ Export ad sources for a particular ad unit (MoPub only).\nYou get a CSV export of the ad sources set up for a particular ad unit.  This allows you to backup the configuration and compare it to the adjusted setup later.\n\n✅ Import and Transfer your orders configuration.\nTune your orders even being offline by editing JSON file. Import it to any Mopub/GAM account in seconds. Same way you can restore pre-saved configuration. \n\n✅ Create orders with granular line items. \nHeader bidding specifics requires a big set of similar line items that target a specific price niche. Do not waste hours on routine one-by-one operations! Let us do it for you.\n\n✅ Duplicate orders easily.\nExperiment with different granularity, advertisers, ad servers, ad units etc. making changes in the whole order, including all embedded line items.\n\n✅ Multiply line items with custom settings.\nJust make a template line item with custom settings and multiply it with one click. Thus, you will have a possibility to “play” with settings and organise monetization strategy.\n\n✅ Perform a “health check” of your configuration and performance.\n\nA note on permissions.  The extension requests the following permissions:\n    \"tabs\",\n    \"identity\",\n    \"webRequest\",\n    \"webRequestBlocking\",\n    \"https://app.mopub.com/*\",\n    \"https://ads.google.com/apis/*\"\nThese are absolutely necessary to communicate with the MoPub or Google Ad Manager website opened in a separate tab.  \"tabs\" permission translates into \"Read your browsing history\" human readable permission, but we don't access the actual history - we just access a MoPub/GAM tab."
