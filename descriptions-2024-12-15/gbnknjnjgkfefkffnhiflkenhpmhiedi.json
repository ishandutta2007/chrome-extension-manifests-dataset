Phish Finder actively searches each visited web page for the username and password fields. If the username is on a protected list, it is shown as white-listed and the user is allowed to proceed to the given site. If the username is not on a protected list, a notification of potential phishing scam is sent to the user and the offending URL is sent to the API. If a site is unlisted, a notice will be sent to the user and the visited web page will be submitted for review."
