The graph visually represents the flow of your conversation, showing the sequence of messages and their branching paths. Informative tooltips display message content, version, and sibling count when you hover over nodes in the graph, making it more comprehensible to understand the branching history of the conversation. Additionally, you can zoom and drag the graph itself within the container, allowing for detailed exploration of the conversation structure. This feature is particularly valuable for getting oriented in even the most complexly branched conversations. This extension efficiently checks for new messages and updates the tree and highlights currently visible branch accordingly, without wasting resources when not in use.\n\n🌳 Dynamic conversation tree: visualizes chat history with distinct icons for user & assistant, showing the sequence & branching paths in real-time.\n🔍 Highlights visible branch: highlights the currently visible branch in red, helping you stay oriented in long threads.\n💬 Hovering over nodes displays a tooltip containing the text content, version, and sibling count of the associated message.\n🔄 Sophisticated update logic: the graph auto-refreshes after specific user interactions and changes to reflect new messages and branches.\n🔲 Resize and move the container with the graph - position it anywhere on the ChatGPT website for optimal viewing.\n⚫ Zoom and drag the graph within the container for detailed exploration of the chat structure and easy navigation through complex branches.\n⚡ Smooth & efficient performance: integrates well with ChatGPT, updates only at a selected number of changes, conserving resources.\n⚙️ Easily switch the extension, graph, and branch highlight on/off.
