It allows setting a dark theme that is less tiring for the eyes.\n\nDARK MODE\nDark Mode is highly demanded since it allows reducing eye strain and facilitate screen use in dark environments. So, we decided to bring it to Freshdesk users since support reps often have to work night shifts. Dark Mode works with all the features that come with your Freshdesk. And you can adjust the contrast and brightness of the theme to your liking. \n\nNIGHT SHIFT\nSwitching to dark mode is an excellent decision for maintaining eye health. But even with the dark mode on, the computer screen still emits blue light, which affects sleep. \n\nThe Night Shift feature inverts the blue light to the warm spectrum. Therefore, reducing the risk of insomnia. You can turn the Night Shift on and off when the need calls for it."
