BUT It has better features and smoother UX 😎 \n\nAdvantages of the Cookies Extension:\n✔️ Cookie value is decoded and easily editable with Cookie Editor! No more raw encoded value editing. Edit the value you really have. JSON is JSON and not something like %2C%0WTF.\n✔️ Flexible columns width. Columns are so dense in the default panel... Here you choose the width you need.\n✔️ Columns visibility control. Do you really need all the columns to be visible in this smaaaall table? I don't think so, at least I've never needed. So now you can hide useless columns.\n✔️ Comprehensive hosts/domains tree. Sometimes you work with websites which have a huge pile of cookie from different domain. Wouldn't it be more effective to choose the domain/host you need? Yes, it would.\n\nI believe it can be a perfect tool in your everyday work and a beautiful complement to your dev-tools panels.\n\nThis Cookie Extension doesn't send or share your cookies. Your privacy is sacred."
