Secretly install it on someone's computer and watch for their reaction when they realize that their entire internet experience has been invaded by the same picture of Dave Coulier.\n\nInspired by the Tumblr entitled \"The Same Picture of Dave Coulier Every Day\" (http://samepicofdavecoulier.tumblr.com/), this Chrome extension brings the idea to the whole internet. Prank a friend (or enemy) by installing this extension on their browser without their knowledge and watch them crack up or panic. Let them squirm but show them how to uninstall when the fun is over.\n\nMade by Ben Halpern (@bhalp1 on Twitter and stuff). If you like it, let me know and if you have an idea for another one, do not hesitate to let me know about it. I plan on making more of these, so stay tuned. I think they're pretty funny."
