I wrote this in 4 minutes (I counted) and then a month later I added a context menu in 5 minutes (I counted that too). \n\nIt's free.  Enjoy Comrades.\n\nJust click the 12ft Icon when you're on a paywalled page to jump over to 12ft.io and read the content or you can open a link from the right-click menu in 12ft.io in a new tab.\n\nNOTE: It seems that the 12ft.io service is no more. Some cool person replicated the service as 1ft.io and this extension now uses that.  Pour one out for 12ft.io.  :(  The name of this extension will remain the same as a memorial to the OG. \n\nOLD NOTE:  I am not the developer or maintainer of 12ft.io  or 1ft.io (the service). I don't know who is, there's no information available about the actual owner/maintainer.   I am only the author of this very simple Chrome extension that redirects to that service."
