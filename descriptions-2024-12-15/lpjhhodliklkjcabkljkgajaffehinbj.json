Keyboards keys can be programmed to transport you to a bookmarked website with a single keystroke. There are 62 programmable hotkeys available. Interface offers a customizable search engine function that can quickly search six different websites interchangeably.\n\nSETUP INSTRUCTIONS: \nAccess the settings menu by either clicking hamburger icon (top left of screen) or by pressing the tilde key (~). Configure the left and right docks by clicking the arrow keys within the settings menu. The docks allow you to bind specific keys to websites. For example, the \"y\" key can be set to open \"youtube.\" \nAll websites links must include \"https\" or \"http\" to work. When the main display main is present (i.e., the clock view), the left and right arrow keys can be used to display the keybinding mapping. The keyboards' keys set to valid links can now be pressed in the main display view to transport to another website. Pressing \"spacebar\" on the main display view will open a search function that can be used to search various website. Customize the search function in the bottom dock settings."
