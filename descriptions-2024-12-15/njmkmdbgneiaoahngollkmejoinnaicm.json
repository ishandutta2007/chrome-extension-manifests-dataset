Currently, it requires a single GPU with 16-24 GiB of memory, but we also plan to release a CPU-only version. At no point in training or execution is your data shared with the entities that trained the original LLMs, with LLM distribution services such as Huggingface, or with us.\n\n-Training and execution are also quick - for a dataset on the order of 1000 emails, training Panza takes well under an hour, and generating a new email takes a few seconds at most.\n\nOnce you trained your own Panza model, you can setup a local web server that allows you to query the model for inference. The PanzaExtension is browser extension that provides an interface directly on top of Gmail, allowing you to use Panza in your session. Given that a Panza server instance is running locally on your machine, you are able to query the model from inside your Gmail sessions to generate your emails based on the prompt that you have provided. Our aim is to show that LLMs can be used as helpful assistants to everyday tasks."
