The solution to this common issue is BusyBee -- a simple but effective site blocker designed to increase your productivity.\n\nBusyBee is different from other site blockers by offering two different ways to block \nsites: Popup mode and Block mode.\n\nIn Popup mode, attempting to access a blocked site will open up a dialog box that you must interact with. If you proceed to browse the blocked site, the dialog will reappear after a short amount of time (you can adjust this amount in the BusyBee settings). This is designed for people who subconsciously open new tabs to browse social media. For these people, the dialog box snaps them out of that mindless browsing. \n\nIn Block mode, attempting to access a blocked site will redirect them to a blockpage, like most site blockers. \n\nYou can enable or disable blocking at any time in the BusyBee control panel by using the Bee button in the top right of your browser. While this requires the user to have more self control over when they choose to block sites, it provides a smooth user experience.\n\nI hope BusyBee improves your workflow -- it improved mine!\n\nPRIVACY NOTICE: \nBusyBee does not collect or share any personal or sensitive data. BusyBee will store your blocklist locally in your browser. BusyBee will read the URLs you visit and your tabs to determine if they should be blocked, but does not store or transmit this information."
