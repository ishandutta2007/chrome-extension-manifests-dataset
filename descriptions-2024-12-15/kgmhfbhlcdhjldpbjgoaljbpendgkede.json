There already exist various extensions to do this, but they all suffered from being old and unmaintained, or buggy, or missing features I consider vital. In particular they could not cope at all with large files, which this extension can (up to hundreds of megabytes).\n\nKey features:\n\n* Extremely fast compared to the other JSON extensions, and is the only extension that copes with large files.\n* The display is aesthetically pleasing but also compact (e.g. small objects and arrays are displayed on one line), and automatically adapts to dark or light mode.\n* Toggle objects and arrays closed, including doing so automatically to all children of the item you click on (ctrl-click to do this).\n* Displays the JSONPath of the item the mouse is over.\n* You can search using regular expressions (type a JavaScript regular expression literal in the search box to do this).\n* URLs in strings (including property names) are detected automatically  and made clickable."
