The highlightsâ€™ opacity can be adjusted via a slider to fit the user's preference, allowing for a customized and efficient review process.\n\nLink Luminary is perfect for checking new or existing websites. It is particularly useful for website administrators, content creators, marketing managers, and developers who need to ensure that all the links on a webpage are functioning correctly and securely before launching new sites. It's also effective at identifying problematic links or potential issues on live sites."
