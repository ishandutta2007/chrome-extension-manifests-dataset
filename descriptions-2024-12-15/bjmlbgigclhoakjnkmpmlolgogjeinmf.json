I know that most of you like movies and comics about heroes from Marvel and DC - and I respect it, but I personally don't like it. I mean, I really don't like it. It make me feel angry. Very. Angry.\n\nSummarizing, I don't want to see anything related to \"Civil War\", \"#TeamIronMan\", \"#TeamCap\" or any shitty post from Marvel / DC universe in my Facebook. If you neither, then download this extension and be happy :)"
