Rank apps and sites by how productive or distracting they are for you, assign them a category, and view reports on your time spent productively for each day and long-term, across different criteria.\n\nForeground stores all your activity data on your local personal computer and does not send it to any server, or share this data with any third-party for the purposes of advertising, marketing, or any other creepy stuff.\n\nThe Foreground Chrome extension is required in order to track details about your current active tab in Chrome, communicating these details to the Foreground Windows programme for your personal computer. With it, you can see details about time spent on various websites, but without it, all your time will show up just as \"Chrome\".\n\nFind more details about Foreground at https://foreground.computer."
