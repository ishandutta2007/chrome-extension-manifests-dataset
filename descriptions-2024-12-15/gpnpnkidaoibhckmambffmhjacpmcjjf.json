Well now you can save your eyes with FreshDark, a dark mode extension for the ticketing system FreshDesks. \n\nThe extension currently only works with the domains my company uses to access FreshDesks, but the extension can be easily adapted for most other domains, including websites besides FreshDesks. If there is a site you would like me to create a variation of this extension for, please reach out to me directly."
