Originally a set top box, TVG has appeared in VHS players, DVD, BluRay, and DishNetwork. Now with tvg+ the technology is ready for the online era.\n\ntvg+ is a browser extension of the TVGuardian powered service that works with a variety of streaming services and web content to filter offensive words and phrases. tvg+ is expanding its filtering technology to target over 350 variations of foul language references and vulgar terms. It is also a far better experience for the viewer by randomizing replacements, grammar detection, and plural matching.\n\nTVGuardian monitors the hidden closed-caption text in the background while you watch TV. Even though you usually do not see the closed-captions, nearly all streaming services have closed captions for TV shows and movies. TVG reads the closed captions ahead of the audio, and knows what’s going to be said before it’s said. Each word is checked against a dictionary of more than 350+ offensive words and phrases. When a foul word or phrase is detected, tvg+ automatically mutes the offensive language.\n\nTVGuardian has multiple filter settings, including: Strict, Moderate, Tolerant.\n\nWord Sets fine-tune your viewing experience: allow some offensive religious uses, sexual references, foreign words, rude references, drug references, and common racial words and phrases.\n\nQ: Does tvg+ catch-all offensive words and phrases?\ntvg+ is very accurate. It does catch 100% in most movies and TV programs. It may miss a word from time to time if an error exists in the closed captioning. On average it has better than a 95% accuracy rate.\n\nQ: Some words seem to slip through, why is that?\ntvg+ detects profanity by reading the closed-captioning information. Occasionally, because of errors in the closed-captioning information, bad words may slip through.\n\nQ: Does the tvg+ just mute the profane word?\nNo. tvg+ mutes around the phrase when profanity is detected. This is due to the automatic nature of the technology.\n\nQ: Do closed captions need to be turned on?\nYes, closed captions need to be turned on in order for tvg+ to detect words and phrases."
