(source: study of 26K devs and 733K PRs). \nWhen your teammates don't know anything about your PR, it's more likely they'll leave it sitting. The WorkerB Chrome extension gives your team context about your PR so they pick it up and review it faster, which helps you merge faster. \n\nWith one click you'll have a magic link that displays: \n\n💥  Estimated review time based on PR size, files changed and number of commits and on our analysis of over 733K PRs.\n\n🔥  Custom notes about the related ticket, release and other context your reviewers need \n\n❤️  You can add a gif to your message to get their attention and make things a little more fun \n\n🔒  We do not access your Github or read your source code! \n\nWorkerB currently works with GitHub and Slack - ping us  if you use other tools \nVisit our community to learn more:  https://workerb.userecho.com \n\nMade with 🪄 by developers at linearb.io"
