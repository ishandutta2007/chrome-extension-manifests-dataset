There are many terms related to new technologies that are often not fully known by users. As a definition, the concept of web hosting or hosting in English is the rental of a server or part of it, where the user is allowed to store all types of computer files that will be accessible through the Internet. It is the fundamental concept, but when buying a web domain, buying hosting or contracting one of these services it is very convenient to study what is included in the hosting contract.\n\nThe best web hosting - Payment server or free?\nThe first choice that the user who wants to hire a hosting service will make is to determine if they are going to choose a free option or a payment option. The first is especially indicated for users who have a personal web page, which usually will not generate income. This service is very limited and implies that the hosting company visualizes advertisements on the hosted website. The payment services are much more complete and are designed for use by users with a higher level of requirements and for companies and professionals. It is always better a cheap web hosting or a cheap hosting, but own, to a free hosting.\n\nTypes of servers for hosting to contract your web space?\nDepending on the type of server to be hired, you can choose between shared servers, dedicated servers, virtual private servers and Cloud Hosting. The hosting in shared servers may be the best when buying a cheap web hosting in Spain. In these cases on the same machine different users have hosted their websites. Dedicated servers imply a machine for each user, which results in greater performance and greater stability. The virtual private servers are halfway between the previous two, since in a single machine there coexist different virtual servers that work independently. The option of Cloud Hosting or hosting in the cloud is the one that in recent times is having a greater boom.\n\nServices included in the contracting of a web hosting.\nOther options to consider when hiring the best professional web hosting are the choice between managed and not managed. In the first, the company is responsible for many tasks that the user must perform in the second case. It is also important to choose the operating system, which will determine the applications to be used. The inclusion of other features, such as domain management, is another point to consider. Things not included are the design of web pages, although the installation of WordPress for example."
