Expose your backbone app in a global variable. (Flag this off for your isStaff or Admin group only if you'd like)\n\n2. Set that variable name in the Openure extension options at chrome://extensions/ and refresh the page (look for Openure in your extensions and click - 'options')\n\n3. CMND-SHIFT-click on a view.  Notice the view you clicked is highlighted in a lightbox (courtesy of jQuery Spotlight - http://dev7studios.com/portfolio/jquery-spotlight/)\n\n4. In the Chrome JS console, use the 'view', 'model', 'collection' and 'options' variables.\n\n\nDetails\n-------------------------\nThe following variables are defined in the interactive terminal.\n\n* view - the view you clicked\n* model - the model of the view, if there is one. Same as typing view.model\n* collection - the collection of the view, if there is one.  Same as typing view.collection\n* options - the options passed to the view.  Same as typing view.options\n\nHelp\n-------------------------\nIf you see \"openure_key is not defined\" then go back to setup step 2.\n\nFor now, it seems like the Openure Extension Options window needs to remain open :(  Working on it...\n\nExample\n-------------------------\nYou can change the model and call view.render(), or see the state of a view.\n\n\nWhy\n-------------------------\nIt's a hassle to find and drill down into your views from the console.  Going back and adding clogs or debuggers isn't fun either.  Just click and get crazy.\n\n\nFuture Development\n-------------------------\nFor a while we were trying to get a jqconsole to appear and be draggable around the screen.  Making this console as good as Chrome's proved very challenging, so this is on a branch for now.\n\nHelp make it better!  https://github.com/sosaucily/openure"
