Customize/add any speeds you please. The max speed Udemy's video player supports with this extension is x16!\n\n❗IMPORTANT - FIRST USE SETUP❗\nThe extension won't work until the cache is refreshed! Either do a hard refresh from the video player page (CTRL + SHIFT + R), or go to your Chrome history (CTRL+H) > Clear browsing data > Clear \"Cached images and files\" (All Time). \n\nYou can change the custom speeds by clicking the extension icon > \"Options\".\n\nEnjoy! 📚👩‍💻📐\n\n---\n\nThis only works for the desktop video player which shows the speed selector on the left side (seen in the extension page picture).\n\nI may need to update the extension if there is ever a conflicting change in Udemy's code. If there is an issue please create an issue on GitHub or email before leaving a bad review, and I will fix it. I rely on you to let me know if there is ever a problem, thanks!\n\nReport a issue:\nwww.github.com/augustmuir/Udemy-Custom-Speed-Changer\ncontact@idality.dev"
