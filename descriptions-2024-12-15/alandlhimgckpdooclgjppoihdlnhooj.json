It’s the only tool that stops your Consultants from contacting your clients' staff on LinkedIn or CV databases.\n\nCustomers of recruitment companies don’t like their staff being solicited by their recruitment partners… Non-solicitation clauses in recruiting agreements prohibit such bad practice but can result in dispute and loss of revenue for the recruitment company concerned.\n\nWhen sourcing candidates, agency Recruiters are alerted to those people that work for their agency’s clients, solving the issue of solicitation and outdated ‘do-not-contact lists’.\n\nMake sure your Recruiters are alert, prevent them from damaging client relationships and protect your customers."
