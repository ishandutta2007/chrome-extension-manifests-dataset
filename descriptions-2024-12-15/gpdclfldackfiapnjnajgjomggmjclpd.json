All without having to open a new tab!\n\n😍 For everyone - Enabled on almost all websites, the plugin aims to help users in all sorts of situations. Whether it’s a shopaholic discovering new stores, a young mother looking for baby advice, or students looking for exam prep, Iffy is always here.\n\n🎨 Authentic feedback - Everybody has a voice on Iffy. Unlike an app store or a certain video platform, websites often hide portions of user feedback, and cherrypick comments. We don’t allow such things and will not allow owners to pay to scrub comments.\n\n🚀 Convenience - Always available. Opened at a click of a button without having to open any tabs or window, Iffy is usable on any website. \n\n👯‍♀️ Join a growing community of users and share your passion and experience with a friendly group of like minded peers. Use custom gifs and emojis to show your mood, or write long impassioned paragraphs to express yourself. It’s all up to you! Our goal is to create an ethical independent review platform free of commercial influence. With more features coming soon, join Iffy today!\n\n🪄 Future goals - We’re focused on making the plugin better in the short term. If there is enough interest in the project, and if the reviews are actually useful to everybody we will port them to mobile, and create a more universal app. There will be a ton of new issues we will need to address if we scale but we’ll address them as they happen.\nWhat we hope to achieve with the plugin is to promote discussion, and avoid negative feedback loops that occur on a lot of review websites. We wish to highlight good private websites and encourage the growth of independent businesses. By becoming somewhat reliable we hope to let the community police how good websites are."
