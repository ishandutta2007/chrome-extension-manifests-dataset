When you're browsing audible.com this add-on looks through the search results and removes the ones which are \"narrated\" by a \"Virtual Voice\". This may result in a blank page of search results if the entire page was \"narrated\" by \"Virtual Voice\" titles. Just go on to the next page and see one or two actual audiobooks amongst the growing virtual horde."
