This is helpful for getting key information like the date the Pin was created on or the number of times the Pin has been re-pinned.\n\nTo use this extension, navigate to a Pin close-up view (such as https://www.pinterest.com/pin/673851163010879386/) then click this extension's bookmarklet and the 'Get Pin Info' button. The page will refresh and after a few seconds you will see a page that highlights important information about the pin that you were viewing."
