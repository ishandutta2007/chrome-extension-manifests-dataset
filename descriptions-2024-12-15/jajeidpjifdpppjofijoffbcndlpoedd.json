Keep better track of books you come across on the web and manage your reading list through this simple browser extension.\n\nSearching for a book is easy. Start by highlighting text on a webpage, right click, and select 'Find Book'. Now you can save the book to your reading list for later. Use the extension icon to revisit your reading list any time.\n\nTo avoid this being just another place to keep your reading list, subscribe to 'My Book Reminders' to turn your passive reading list into an active one. Now you'll receive gentle reminders with useful information about the books on your reading list to help you manage and prioritize your books. This helps aid in removing books you may no longer be interested in.\n\nReach out with suggestions and complaints.",

Simply highlight and right-click on a book title and select \"Find Book\" on the menu. That's it!\n\nThe search result gives a short description of the book, an external link to purchase or read more about the book, and a link to save the book to your list for later. \n\nYou can always come back to your saved books by clicking on the extension icon, and clicking on any individual book you'd like to come back to. Each book is saved with the URL that it was originally searched from so you have context around why you saved it in the first place."
