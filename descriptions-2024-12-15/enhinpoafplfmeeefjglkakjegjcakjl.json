Whether you are logging into Facebook, Gmail, PayPal or Twitter, all secure websites offer an option to save passwords in the browser but none would reveal the passwords in plain text.\n\nMicrosoft Edge browser adds an eye icon to the password field to let you quickly mask and unmask the characters. This Google Chrome extension uses a similar approach. It shows the passwords when you focus the password field and replaces the characters with dots as soon as you move the cursor out of the password field.\n\nSome websites, for example PayPal, do not offer the option to save your password in the browser. \n\nThis Google Chrome extension overrides the default behaviour and lets you save the password so you can quickly login to your favourite websites without having to enter the password each time. It does so by adding the autocomplete=on property to the input password fields but, unfortunately, in the newer releases on Google Chrome, the property is ignored."
