Ideally, this will support most popular services that have a shortened form (like youtube.com links to youtu.be). This extension does not operate with URL shortening services. It only computes the new URL from the existing one. A list of the supported services can be found at https://github.com/dlowe-net/linksnip/.\n\nIn addition to copying shortened links, Linksnip will also remove various tracking parameters from the URL.  The result is a much shorter, cleaner link to be shared.\n\nTo use, click on the extension button. A shortened URL will be copied into the clipboard. If the extension doesn't know how to shorten a URL, the whole address will be copied.\n\nThis extension requires access to :\n- your tabs (to get the page address)\n- write access to your clipboard (to put the page address in there)"
