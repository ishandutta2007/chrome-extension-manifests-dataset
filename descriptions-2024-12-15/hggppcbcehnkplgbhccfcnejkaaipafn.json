I didn't ask them for permission to make this. If they ask me to take it down, I am happy to do so. Please don't sue me.\n\nFiveThirtyEight made a system for comparing your own NFL forecasts to those made by their Elo rating system. When multiple games are being played concurrently, it's a bit of a hassle to track how the teams are doing relative to what your forecasts were, so this Chrome extension was born. It pulls current game data from the ESPN API, and when you're on FiveThirtyEight's Elo game results page, it uses some (very) hacky javascript to insert the current quarter, time remaining, and score for each game that is currently live. When there is a live game, the page will refresh every minute. When there is no live game (and the page is still open for whatever reason), the page will refresh every hour. If the page isn't open in your browser, the extension will just sit idle.\n\nThe code is a hot trainwreck and doesn't have anything in the way of error handling, but the risk of trying it out is slim to none (if it doesn't work, just remove the extension). The source code is here: https://github.com/cryptogramber/Elo-Live-Score\n\nFiveThirtyEight NFL Predictions Game: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nfl-forecasting-game/\n\nResults page (where this extension works when a live game is occurring): https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nfl-forecasting-game/results/\n\nMore information on Elo ratings: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nfl/\n\nNo usage data is collected by the extension, but it does query ESPN's API for current game stats and I have no doubt they log connection metadata on their end. The only permissions required from this extension are access to the 538 page (to show the current scores), the ability to reload the 538 page (to update), and the ability to access the ESPN API endpoint to query current scores."
