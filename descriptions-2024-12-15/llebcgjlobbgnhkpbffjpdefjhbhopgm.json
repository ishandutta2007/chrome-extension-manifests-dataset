However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) actually enabled the virus to spread by covering it up and lying about its severity, and by pressuring other countries to continue to allow travel to and from China. Therefore, we should call it the CCP virus, because they are responsible for the virus spreading across the world and becoming a global pandemic. This extension will help you get used to the term by replacing 'COVID-19' and other names for the virus to 'CCP virus.'\n\nThis is not an attack on the Chinese people. They are the victims in this situation. The CCP oppresses their own citizens and violates their basic rights. By calling it the CCP virus and not the Chinese/China virus, I am going out of my way to clarify that I condemn the government and not the people.\n\nThe extension also replaces anything typed in text fields (emails, forum posts etc) when it is submitted. To prevent this from happening, simply turn off the extension first.\n\nCCP Virus 19 currently changes names of the virus in the following languages: Arabic (العربية), Chinese (繁體中文, 简体中文), Dutch (Nederlands), English, Filipino, French (Français), German (Deutsch), Hebrew (עברית), Hindi (हिन्दी), Hungarian (Magyar), Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia), Italian (Italiano), Japanese (日本語), Korean (한국어), Persian (فارسی), Polish (polski), Portuguese (Português), Romanian (Română), Russian (русский), Spanish (Español), Thai (ไทย), Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt)\n\nPromo tile is by China Uncensored"
