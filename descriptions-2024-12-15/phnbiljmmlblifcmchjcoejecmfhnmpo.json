Frustrated by the inability to search records by ID or the need for complex workarounds? Say hello to NetSuite QuickSearch Pro, the Chrome extension that transforms your approach to searching data within NetSuite.\n\nAvailable on every NetSuite page, QuickSearch Pro offers a sleek interface that enhances your productivity. Whether you're a developer craving detailed data formats or a business user seeking swift access to records, QuickSearch Pro delivers speed, accuracy, and flexibility.\n\nKey Features\n\n- Direct Record ID Searches: Instantly access any record by simply entering its type and internal ID. For instance, quickly pull up a sales order with salesorder:1.\n\n- Multiple ID Retrieval: Manage multiple records effortlessly by entering their IDs in a comma-separated list, perfect for batch operations. Example: salesorder:1,2.\n\n- Specific Field Value Searches: Pinpoint records by specifying field values, ensuring you find exactly what you're looking for. For example, locate all sales orders under the “Acme Inc.” subsidiary with salesorder:subsidiary=\"Acme Inc\".\n\n- Joined Column Queries: Explore deeper data connections with searches that include joined column details. Example: salesorder:subsidiary.country=\"Canada\".\n\n- Multi-Field Searches: Refine your search with multiple criteria, filtering records based on several field values. For example, locate a specific sales order by tranid and trandate (using your account's date format) with salesorder:tranid=\"123\",trandate=\"2020-1-1\". \n\n- Flexible Wildcard Searches: Expand your search capabilities with wildcard characters for partial matches, making your searches as broad or as narrow as needed. Example: salesorder:subsidiary=\"A_me%\".\n\n- Exact Match Capability: Achieve accuracy with exact match searches that prevent misinterpretation of wildcard characters. Example: salesorder:memo=\"100%\\\".\n\n- JSON Representation Access: For those who need a deeper dive, retrieve the JSON representation of records for detailed analysis or development purposes. Example: salesorder:1.json.\n\nNetSuite QuickSearch is not just a tool; it’s an essential upgrade that enhances your data navigation in NetSuite. It eliminates the need for frustrating searches or inefficient workarounds, allowing you to focus on what’s important—your work.\n\nDisclaimer: This product is not affiliated with or endorsed by Oracle NetSuite."
