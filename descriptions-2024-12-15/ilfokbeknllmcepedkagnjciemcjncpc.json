With its extension badge, you can easily check the number of confirmed cases in your country. Plus, it has a simulation tool that shows how the virus spreads and how social distancing can help slow down its spread. If you want to check it out, just click on the badge icon and you'll be able to see a sample simulation for 100 people. Stay safe and healthy!"
