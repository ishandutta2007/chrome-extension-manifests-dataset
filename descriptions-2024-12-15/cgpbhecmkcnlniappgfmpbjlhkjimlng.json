Its objective is to block these miners across all websites.\n\nThe extension uses two methods to stop miners from working. First, it blocks requests that are loaded from a predefined blacklist, which is a common technique used by ad-blockers and mining blockers. The second method involves detecting possible mining activities within loaded scripts and quickly stopping them.\n\nThe source code is available on Github :\nhttps://github.com/felishaww/blockCoin\n\nDevelopers:\nFelisha Miranda (felisha.miranda@binus.ac.id)\nSharleen Emmanuela (sharleen.emmanuela@binus.ac.id)\n\nBlacklist Credit: NoCoin"
