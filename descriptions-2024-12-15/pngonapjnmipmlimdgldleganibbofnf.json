However, these shows are presented unedited from the original feed sent to broadcasters. This means that when the feed cuts to what would have been a commercial break for the television networks, FITE TV users are presented with the AEW ident card for three minutes. The FITE TV player does not offer an easy way to skip this break, forcing users to calculate for themselves what the current time code plus three minutes is, and skip it with their mouse.\n\nThis extension allows users to make this skip with a simple keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+Right.\n\nThis makes it easier to perform actions that can already be performed with the mouse. This is not an ad blocker - the streams do not contain ads, but a three minute break where ads would have been in the televised version. While viewers could skip this break using the controls on the player anyway, this extension makes the process easier.\n\nFull instructions on how to use it can be found here: http://www.elitebreakscissor.com"
