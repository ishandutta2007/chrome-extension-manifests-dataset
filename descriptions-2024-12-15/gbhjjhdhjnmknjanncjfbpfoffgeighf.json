Make sure to pin the extension after installing it by clicking the extension puzzle icon in Chrome and clicking the pin next to \"Rabbu Airbnb Calculator\".\n\nHow to use:\n1. While on Zillow, Redfin, or Compass browsing listings, click the \"View on Rabbu\" button on the page to be taken to an estimate of the listing's monthly revenue on Airbnb.\n2. View the initial revenue estimate calculation, adjust filters (bathrooms, guest count, amenities, etc.), and select or de-select comparable properties to refine your estimate.\n3. View important short-term rental metrics like: average daily rate (ADR), occupancy rate, revPAN (revenue per available night, calculated as: ADR x Occupancy), and a seasonalized monthly and annual revenue projection based on forecasted future market trends of how Airbnb rentals in this area perform monthly throughout the year.\n\nWhat data will you receive with your revenue estimate?\nRabbu's Airbnb calculator includes the following data and metrics:\n- Average Daily Rate (ADR): The average rate posted for Airbnbs in the search over the next 30 days.\n- Occupancy: The percentage of nights reserved over the next 30 days of Airbnbs in the search.\n- RevPAN: The average revenue generated per available night of Airbnbs in the search for the next 30 days on a seasonalized basis. The formula for RevPAN is as follows: ADR (Average Daily Rate) x Occupancy.\n- Seasonalized Monthly Revenue Projection: How much this address could earn on average per month as a short-term rental. There is also a chart that helps investors visualize seasonality throughout the year, with the option to adjust it for the 25% and 75% percentiles.\n- Nearby Comparable Properties: Nearby Airbnb rentals to the address searched. Including or excluding any of these comps will refine the estimate. You can also view comparable properties' calendars for occupancy and pricing to help inform a pricing strategy.\n\nHow does the Rabbu Airbnb calculator work?\nRabbu has gathered the data of millions of Airbnb listings across the United States to calculate the earning potential of any address entered on its calculator. This is done using a series of algorithms and formulas that run behind the scenes weekly.\n\nThe data is refreshed weekly to ensure that investors and hosts are equipped with the most real-time data and information available.\n\nThe revenue figures presented on Rabbu's Airbnb calculator are gross revenue figures. This calculation is not inclusive of cleaning fees, Airbnb's fees, other service fees, or property management fees.\n\nWhy use a short-term rental calculator?\nShort-term rentals are a real estate asset that can provide impressive returns to investors in the form of rental income and property appreciation. When looking for new properties to invest in, it is imperative that investors understand the potential rental income, expenses, seasonality, and nearby competition to understand if a property would make a good Airbnb investment."
