It takes many factors into account to give you a rating from 1 to 10 on the sustainability of the garment you are looking at. This helps you make a better-informed choice about what to buy.\n\nHow to Use Ask Quinn?\n\nIt's easy. Just browse the internet as you normally would. Ask Quinn will use AI to analyze any garment and provide you with relevant information about the fabrics and the brand in the bottom-right corner of your screen.\n\nThe application and the results are available in English, but you can scan websites in Dutch, German, English, Italian, and Spanish at this moment.\n\nüöß ASK QUINN is currently in beta üöß\nWe will regularly update the extension with improvements and more information to help you make better-informed choices."
