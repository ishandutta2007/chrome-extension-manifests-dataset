The user will be given details of the asset transfer in the extension's interface and will be able to perform sensitive operations such as entering a password in a secure environment, which the user can approve or deny\n\nSafebox will only read the password entered by the user, and will erase the information about the user immediately after completing the asset transfer operation, without saving any information about the user or traces of the operation, it can be used like any other Chrome extension, at any time \"View source code \"Safebox\", or on Github to view the source code."
