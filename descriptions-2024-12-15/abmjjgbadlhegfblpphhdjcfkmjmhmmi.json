Then you'll have noticed how many students forget to share assignments with you, prompting you to ask them to share it, and it evolves into a huge, unnecessary mess. This extension solves that problem by creating a \"Share With Students\" button in Google Docs, Slides, and Sheets. When clicked, it generates a link that will automatically copy the document and share it with you whenever a student clicks it."
