Simple..!\n\nWell, how do I remove extensions from a group?\nJust as adding, this is very, very simple (Pretty much the same as adding). Start by clicking on the group you want to remove extensions from, then click on a couple of extensions (Preferably the ones you want removed), and click the group name (The one you're currently in) and bam! They're gone!\n\nThis is useful if you have got quite a few extensions installed and you don't want them all active at the same time, but rather in groups depending on what you're doing in that particular moment.\n\n\nSuper awesome ninja web dev? I'd love you to help me out with this minor project at https://github.com/Mobilpadde/ManExt :D"
