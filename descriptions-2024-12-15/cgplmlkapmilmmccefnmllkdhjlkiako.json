Often, you want to quickly get a refresher on a particular topic or term but you don't want to lose your place in the paper you're reading. You can simply click on the PubMed Genius icon in your toolbar to open a small popup window to run an abstract search for a particular term. If you'd like, you can drill down to the paper to take a closer look and when you're done, click back on your browser and the popup disappears. If you highlight a word on the page (of any website), right click and select the PubMed Genius menu item, you can run a search of the highlighted term in a new tab. It's that easy!"
