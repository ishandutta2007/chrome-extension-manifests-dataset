In many cases there is a third party web service behind those extensions and your data is stored remotely. Bookmark Dial on the other hand uses only browser capabilities (meaning you can use the usual keyboard shortcuts, menu entries and buttons for bookmark handling to add, edit and delete dial items) and your data only leaves your computer if you enable browser sync.\n\nThumbnails\n----------\n\nBy default, thumbnails are arranged and sized (up to a maximum size) to be as big as possible while covering as much space as possible. You can drag and drop them to change the order.\n\nThey are generated from a snapshot of the visible area of a bookmarked webpage and stored in the browser. If there is no thumbnail available yet a snapshot is taken once the page has been loaded in the currently active tab. There is also a button in the popup opened from the toolbar icon to create a new snapshot. That allows you to arrange the visible area of the page by scrolling or resizing the window to capture exactly what you want.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nSelect a bookmark folder and check available settings in the popup opened from the toolbar icon or from the extension page in your browser's extension manager. Open a new tab.\n\nCustomisation\n-------------\n\nYou can set a background colour and/or image (including sizing) in the preferences. There is also a text field to provide custom CSS.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\n- if a bookmark redirects to another page, no thumbnail will be generated as the its URL will not match the page in the currently active tab\n- special URLs like about: chrome: file: etc. can cause problems due to limitations in the webextension API\n- Firefox:\n  - color chooser and file chooser close the popup - to change settings using them, go to the extension page in your browser's extension manager\n  - compatibility issues with [New Tab Override\n    extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)\n\nPrivacy Policy\n--------------\n\nThis extension does not collect or send data of any kind to third parties.\n\nFeedback\n--------\n\nYou can report bugs or make feature requests on [Github](https://github.com/sblask/webextension-bookmark-dial)\n\nPatches are welcome."
