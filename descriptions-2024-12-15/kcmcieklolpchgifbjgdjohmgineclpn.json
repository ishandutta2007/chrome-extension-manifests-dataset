If an email has been flagged as \"Risky\", a colored box will appear next to the email to indicate the level of risk.\n\nYou can also click on the box to find details on the email and flag an email yourself.\n\nThe idea is that you'll know if an email address is probably a risk to interact with because others have flagged that email as risky.\n\nUpcoming features:\n* Integrate with new Google Inbox\n* Updated look and feel\n* Optionally scan emails you've already sent for risk factors\n* Safari, Firefox extensions\n* Outlook, Thunderbird and other extensions"
