Even the best cartoons have moments I wish my son wouldn't see, due to the fact how young he is. Especially if I'm not sitting next to him to explain what's going on in the video and why. And a lot of times I skip violent or sexual or scary content, but it's such an annoying thing when done manually.\nWell, fear no more - with this extension no more manual fast forwarding - you set up what you want to skip, save it and automatically reuse it next time! I am the first person to benefit from it, but you could be next. Go ahead. Try it. It's free.\n\n- Add any number of video ranges to skip\n- Mark mark start and end as easy as click a button while at desired position\n- Select your very own name for the modified video and save it\n- Use in-app list to quickly open stored videos with Skip! ranges"
