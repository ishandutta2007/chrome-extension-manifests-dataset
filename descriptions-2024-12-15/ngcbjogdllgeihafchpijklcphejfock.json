They can practice their words with automatically generated flashcards and quizzes.\n\nThe basic functionalities are free!\n\nHow it works?\nReading is the most effective way to increase your vocabulary. With iTeach.world, you are never stopped by words you don't know again. While you are browsing online, you can double-click on words you don't know. iTeach.world will show you the meanings, sounds, and importance of the words. It's a quick and easy way to build up your vocabulary and make reading fun! \n\nPS - We don’t store or use any of your personal information!"
