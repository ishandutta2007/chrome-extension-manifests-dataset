They, in turn, might consult their network. Adze recaptures this formula, and makes it scale to the whole web.\n\nTo that end, adze is a way you can share really good links with your friends. It's not an app, or platform run by some business. Nor is it a cryptocurrency you have to buy to use.  Adze both finds good content and filters out bad content using your values, and those of people you explicitly trust.  If someone is doing something you don't like on adze, you can block them and you'll never be affected by them on the web again.   If you want to, you can be exposed to content  that was highly rated by friends of people you trust, but the core adze philosophy is to push control to the edges of the network as much as possible.  \n\nAdze is starting its life as a browser plugin. Right now there are some rough edges, but we hope to make this much more accessible to everyone, and to dramatically expand its capabilities."
