These can be articles, videos, book reviews, podcasts, and essentially anything that has a URL. \n\nYou can keep your lists to yourself, or share them with others. When you do share them, just imagine how delightful of an experience youâ€™re creating for someone with similar interests!\n\nWe are still early on in our journey, and would love to get your feedback so we can improve Listory and make it the perfect place for content curation. Feel free to drop us a line at hello@listory.com, or join our community at listory.useresponse.com.\n\nThe Listory team."
