Self sign up and no credit card required. Get started at https://www.splashtop.com/secure \n\nHere are the main benefits:\n\nSimple and Secure Access: Our Zero Trust access model ensures secure real-time access to applications and services by enforcing the least privilege. The administrator can set up policies within a single control panel to provide end-to-end security, including client security posture, authentication, authorization, conditional access, and privileged access.\n\nBrowser-Based Application Access: With zero-trust access, our solution ensures secure access to web and network applications, including SSH, RDP, VNC, Telnet, and Kubernetes, all through a browser without the need for additional agents to be installed. In addition, our solution offers mobile apps and browser extensions to enhance the browser-based application access user experiences.\n\nNetwork Access Everywhere: Our solution guarantees zero-trust access to both on-premises and cloud resources through a Secure Workspace app available on major operating systems. Our Secure Workspace app ensures zero-trust access and enhances the user experience with features such as an application launcher and password management.\n\nComprehensive Identity Access Management: Our solution offers built-in user and group management, customizable user onboarding, and advanced IAM controls, including conditional authentication, conditional multi-factor authentication, integration with multiple identity providers, support for SAML, OIDC, OAuth, and SCIM/JIT provisioning for users and groups.\n\nSecure Device Enrollment and Security Posture Enforcement: Device configuration enables administrators to manage device enrollment. Device Posture Check improves network security by only allowing employees to connect with devices that meet specific security standards.\n\nZero Touch and Simplified Deployment: Our simplified Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution enables easy deployment of connectors with zero-touch required.\n\nConvenient and Secure Third-party/Privileged Access: Our ZTNA solution ensures secure access for third parties by utilizing anonymous access links or third-party controlled identity providers, granting access to privileged systems without exposing login credentials to the end-user.\n\nBuilt-in Secure Password Management: Our Zero-knowledge password manager for businesses provides secure storage, sharing, and access to login credentials and other sensitive data. The sensitive information is protected by a strong authentication key derived from a master password known only to the user, and the IT administrator can enforce Zero Trust policies to protect access to the password and the sensitive data. \n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.splashtop.com/legal/privacy-policy",
