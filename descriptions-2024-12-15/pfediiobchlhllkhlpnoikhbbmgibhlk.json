This morning I woke up to a story of a law enforcement officer being shot and killed while filling up his patrol car at the gas station.\n\nSee how different the web is when we call guns what they are--murder weapons.\n\nFeel free to make suggestions for additional words to change to \"murder weapon\".\n\nLinks:\n\nByron Clark's \"PC2Respect\" http://bit.ly/1fNsSHh\nMake Your Own Text-Replacing Chrome Extension http://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions/"
