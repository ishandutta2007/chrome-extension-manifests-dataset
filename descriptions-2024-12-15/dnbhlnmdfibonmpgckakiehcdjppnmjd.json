It does not send the HTML/CSS/JS content to any external server (unless exported to jsfiddle.net).\n\nlightjs does, however, rely on external libraries, if used. Various CDNs are used to load libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap and others.\n\nlightjs is designed to be lightweight, not feature rich, while still providing some flexibility in development.\n\nlightjs allows for direct conversion into a JS fiddle on jsfiddle.net (we are not affiliated).\n\nlightjs is open source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/jorgenys/lightjs"
