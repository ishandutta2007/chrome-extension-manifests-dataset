The tags are considered when searching and can be used for navigation. It also supports searching for and navigating to your open tabs and history. Lastly, the extension allows you to configure \"search engines\", which will forward you to arbitrary search engines with the search term as the search query (helpful as a fallback).\n\nIn general, the extension is very customizable and has a dark / light theme that is selected based on your system settings.\n\nYou can find more information here: https://github.com/Fannon/search-bookmarks-history-and-tabs#readme"
