This information can be associated with the particular tab (by unticking the \"persist\" option), or just the page URL. This is useful both for remembering why you had a tab open, and for recovering from crashes.\n\nThe extension will have a yellow icon on tabs with annotations.\n\nOne can also view a list of all the annotations, and go to the relevant tab directly from there.\n\nSee http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/1913/19 for more information.\n\nSpecial thanks to @TildalWave for the icon!"
