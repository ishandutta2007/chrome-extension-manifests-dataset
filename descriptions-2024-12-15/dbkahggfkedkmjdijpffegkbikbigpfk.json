Simply log into one (or many) cloud storage accounts via the options page then right click on any image and select \"Save to Cloud.\" The image will automatically be uploaded to any enabled cloud storage account.\n\nThe extension will automatically create a \"photo_save\" folder in the root directory of your cloud storage account and save all images to that directory.\n\nThis extension requires the ability to access and read all http and https websites in order to enable the right-click upload feature. The extension does not do anything else with this permission and the code is available for inspection and forkage on github.\n\nThis extension has been tested with Dropbox and Box.net accounts.\n\nImage uploading is provided via the Kloudless API."
