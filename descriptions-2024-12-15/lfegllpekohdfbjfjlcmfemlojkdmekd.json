It does not work on all RCWs and WACs. On some RCWs and WACs it will format them incorrectly or not at all.\n\nThe indentation of the law can be changed by double clicking on the text and then dragging the text left or right.\n\nAdd extra information to the RCW or WAC number by adding a dash to the end of the url, and then after the dash add what ever words you want. The words will be printed next to the law number on the web page like magic! It is a built in feature to the website, not part of this extension.\n\nExample: https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.183-AddedText!!!"
