In addition, FasterWeb enriches search results by adding the smart search widget beside the search results.\n\nThe FasterWeb works best on pages on the same sites. Pages to external sites are still faster but more is needed to be noticeable.\n\nHow it works: Before clicking a link, hover your mouse over it. When you have hovered for 65 milliseconds, there is one chance out of two that you will click, so Faster Web starts preloading at this moment, leaving on average over 300 ms for the page to preload.\n\nPages that trigger an action (such as logging out or deleting something) are excluded. (FasterWeb won’t preload pages with a “?” in their URL.)\n\nFasterWeb — previously called FasterChrome — is based on instant.page, a library that you can add to your site in just one minute to give it the same speed boost.\n\n\nADS\nWhen using FasteWeb, you may encounter ads for other extensions and affiliate links. These situational ads allow us to develop the product and make it free.\n\n\nMade with ❤️ by BrowseCraft gang."
