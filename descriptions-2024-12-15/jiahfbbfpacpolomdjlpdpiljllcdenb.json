It automates the process of selecting and deleting multiple photos, saving you time and effort when you need to remove a large number of images from your account.\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Bulk Selection**: Automatically selects multiple photos at once, streamlining the deletion process.\n2. **Customizable Deletion Limit**: Set a maximum number of photos to delete in one session (default is 10,000).\n3. **Automatic Scrolling**: Navigates through your photo library automatically, ensuring all photos are considered for deletion.\n4. **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time updates on the number of photos selected and deleted.\n5. **Error Handling**: Robust error management to ensure smooth operation even if issues occur.\n6. **User-Initiated**: The deletion process only starts when you click the extension icon, giving you full control.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Smart Selection**: The tool uses advanced selectors to identify and select photos in your Google Photos interface.\n2. **Batch Processing**: Photos are selected and deleted in batches for improved efficiency.\n3. **Confirmation Handling**: Automatically confirms deletion actions, saving you from repetitive clicking.\n4. **Scrolling Logic**: Implements intelligent scrolling to load more photos as needed.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n- Clearing out old or unwanted photos in bulk\n- Managing storage space in your Google Photos account\n- Streamlining your photo collection after a large import\n- Quickly removing duplicate or similar images\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. Install the Google Photos Delete Tool extension from the Chrome Web Store.\n2. Navigate to [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com).\n3. Click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar.\n4. The tool will automatically start selecting and deleting photos based on the default settings.\n5. Monitor the progress through console logs (accessible via Chrome DevTools).\n6. The process will continue until it reaches the set limit or runs out of photos to delete.\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can customize the tool's behavior by modifying the `CONFIG` object in the extension's code:\n\n- `maxCount`: Set the maximum number of photos to delete in one session.\n- `timeout`: Adjust the maximum wait time for operations.\n- `scrollDelay`: Fine-tune the delay between scrolling actions.\n\n## Important Notes and Warnings\n\n1. **Use with Caution**: This tool performs bulk deletions. Make sure you want to delete the selected photos before starting the process.\n2. **Permanent Deletion**: Deleted photos will be moved to the Google Photos Trash. They will be permanently deleted after 60 days unless manually restored.\n3. **Account-Wide Action**: The tool operates on your entire Google Photos library. It doesn't target specific albums or date ranges.\n4. **Performance Impact**: Running this tool may temporarily slow down your browser due to the intensive nature of bulk operations.\n5. **Network Dependency**: A stable internet connection is required for optimal performance.\n6. **UI Changes**: If Google updates the Photos interface, the tool may require updates to maintain compatibility.\n\n## Privacy and Data Security\n\n- This extension operates entirely within your browser and Google Photos interface.\n- It does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or photos.\n- No external servers are accessed during the deletion process.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- Works with the latest version of Google Chrome.\n- Designed for the English version of Google Photos.\n- May work with other Chromium-based browsers, but this is not officially supported.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Cannot target specific date ranges or albums for deletion.\n- Does not provide options for selective deletion based on criteria like file size or image content.\n- The tool's efficiency may vary based on your internet speed and computer performance.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n\n1.
