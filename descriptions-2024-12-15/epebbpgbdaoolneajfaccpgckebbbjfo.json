With Tiled, your workspace becomes a harmonious haven, allowing you to craft personalised layouts that suit your style.\n\n====================\nFEATURES\n====================\n\nCREATE YOUR IDEAL LAYOUT\n\nForget about generic presets—Tiled understands that workspace layouts are as unique as the individuals using them. That's why Tiled takes an intuitive approach to help you create your workspace layout. Use the grid to design your window arrangement, click \"Apply\" and all your browser windows will fall in line just the way you envisioned.\n\nSAVE LAYOUTS\n\nAfter designing a new layout, click \"Save layout\" and enter a name for your new arrangement. Whenever you want to switch to a specific layout, you can do so effortlessly with a single click from the extension popup.\n\nMULTI-DISPLAY SUPPORT\n\nTiled's grid mirrors the aspect ratio of your current display. Tiled always uses the current display when applying layouts, so the display where your window is located at the time of applying a layout will be the one used by Tiled.\n\nBEAUTIFUL INTERFACE\n\nTiled seamlessly integrates into the Google Chrome™ environment, both in its visual design and behaviour. Launch the extension by clicking the extension icon or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+L or Command+Shift+L. The arrow keys can be used to navigate the menu or keyboard shortcuts can be used to quickly access the menu items."
