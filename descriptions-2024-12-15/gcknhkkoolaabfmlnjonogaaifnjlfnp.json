No paid accounts are necessary; bring your own proxies or buy from any vendor. The original proxy tool, since 2006. FoxyProxy has been owned and developed consistently by the same team since 2006. It has never been sold and never will.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nFoxyProxy is a Chrome and Firefox extension which switches an internet connection across one or more proxy servers:\n\n1. by point-and-click of colored icons\n2. by URL (define URL patterns with wildcards or regular expressions)\n3. by browser tab - set individual proxies per tab: assign up to 4 proxy servers for use on 4 different tabs.\n\nFoxyProxy automates the manual process of editing your browser's proxy settings.\n\n* Customize colors and country flags to make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n* Proxy per tab, by URL, or by point-and-click of colored icons\n* Import/Export all of your settings, or just URL patterns, to share with others (fixed in 8.0 and above)\n* Select a proxy specifically to use in Incognito Mode\n* Keyboard shortcuts\n* Globally exclude any domain from proxying\n* Create patterns with wildcards or regular expressions. A pattern tester is included.\n* (optional) Automatically synchronize all of your proxy settings with your other Chrome instances when you use Sync.\n* Turn WebRTC on/off to further limit discovery of your IP address\n* Built-in predefined selections for tor, privoxy, and psiphon\n* Extensive built-in help\n\n\nSource code is at https://github.com/foxyproxy/browser-extension\n\nFoxyProxy has been owned and developed consistently by the same team since 2006. It has never been sold and never will.\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\n* downloads: Required to export the extension settings to a file. Users can import that file to other Chrome/Firefox instances, or share it with colleagues, in order to keep the same settings. It can also be backed up and used later.\n\n* proxy: The core function of the extension is to allow users to set the proxy server used by the browser.\n\n* storage: Required to store proxy server settings (hostname, port, username, and which proxy \nserver is enabled by the user).\n\n* tabs: Required so that users can set separate proxies to use per tab. It is also needed for \"QuickAdd\" to quickly add a URL pattern that applies to the current/active tab. It is also used to open a URL to getfoxyproxy.org where there is online help.\nwebRequest: Required to authenticate with proxy servers via webRequest.onAuthRequired\nwebRequestAuthProvider: Required to authenticate with proxies servers via webRequest.onAuthRequired\n\n* browsingData: Required so the extension can delete cookies, indexedDB, and localStorage when requested by the user on the Options page (Delete Browsing Data button)\nprivacy: Required so the extension can call browser.privacy.network.webRTCIPHandlingPolicy to turn on/off webRTC in Chrome (Limit WebRTC checkbox in Options page)\n\n* host permission: Required to proxy all webRequests and provide proxy server authentication. <all_urls> is used because users may choose to load any/all URLs through proxy servers (chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired and chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener) . Required to proxy all webRequests and provide proxy server authentication. Also needed to get accounts details from FoxyProxy servers, if requested by the user with the Import FoxyProxy Account on the Import tab.\n\n** No remote code is used in this extension. **\n\n* Why is there a crypto javascript library in the extension?\n\nThis crypto library is needed to migrate encrypted settings from version 3.x to version 8.x. It is not used to encrypt anything; only to decrypt old data when upgrading from version 3.x -> 8.x.",
    "de,es,fa,fr,pl,pt_BR,ru,uk,zh_CN,zh_TW": "* Uses Chrome Proxy API instead of changing system proxy settings.\n* Supports auto switching, which switches among proxies according to URL rules\n* Data import/export\n* Online rule lists (AutoProxy compatible)\n* Uses event handling, which is much more efficient and accurate,  instead of polling to monitor proxy change.\n* Advanced quick switch mode options allow you to switch among your proxies with one click."
