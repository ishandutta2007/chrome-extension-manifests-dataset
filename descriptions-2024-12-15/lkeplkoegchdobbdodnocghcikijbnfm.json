Scrambling to reach every garden across the globe to spread the Easter joy, some eggs are bound to fall out of their baskets, as they dash through fiber cables deep underground, handing out eggs to people all around (few people know this is actually their preferred method of transportation; it is fast and also avoids them getting held up at customs).\n\nIndeed, some of these eggs have even ended up scattered across random websites on the internet! Now it falls to you to find and gather these eggs, to help Mr. and Mrs. Bunny as Easter draws near. Who knows; you might even find the ever-illusive... Dragon Egg?\n\n#######\nQuestions\n#######\n\nQ: Why are you doing this?\nA: It's a school assignment, and one of the grading criteria is to include easter eggs.\n\nQ: Easter is already over :(\nA: Maybe so, but there are still plenty of eggs left to be found!\n\nQ: How many egg-puns can you fit into an eggstension?\nA: Yes."
