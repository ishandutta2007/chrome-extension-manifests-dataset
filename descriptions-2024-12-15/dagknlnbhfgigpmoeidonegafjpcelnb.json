I am a man with a camera: regardless of the subject matter, the act of capturing the image requires the same talent and vision.\n\nFor over 20 years I have been perfecting my skills in the art of photography. With over a thousand assignments under my belt, here in Ottawa and around the world, I have invaluable experience and expertise that I can bring to your photography session. My work has been featured in several Canadian and international publications for its editorial value. It has been exhibited by galleries in New York, Montreal, Dominican Republic and Collioure in France. I received my first photography award at the age of 20."
