Will not affect other search filters such as images, videos, news, books, shopping, forums, maps, flights, or finance.\n\nThe web filter clears the clutter that is the automatically generated AI summaries and rich results like product ads, video clips, FAQ dropdowns (\"People also ask\"), sidebar stuff, and more. All you'll get are the web results.\n\nCompatible with other country codes like google.de, google.cn, google.co.uk, etc.\n\nCompatible with Google My Business and Google reviews.\n\nOpera users: this extension works with the Opera browser, but there is an additional step needed to enable it after installing it. Right click the extension icon and select \"Manage extension\". On this page, scroll down to the setting \"Allow access to search page results\" and toggle it so that it is enabled. This setting is disabled by default.\n\nTech speak: automatically appends \"udm=14\" to the end of your search query only when the filter is set to \"all.\"\n\n== Changelog ==\n\n**Version 1.2.0 - Released September 20, 2024**\n\n* Added a popup so when clicked, you can easily disable/enable the functionality.\n* Added an additional check for the \"stick\" parameter to avoid conflicting with Google My Business and Google reviews."
