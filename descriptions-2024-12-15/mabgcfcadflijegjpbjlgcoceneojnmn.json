Posts are not deleted or removed in any way. You can still elect to view them, but they are hidden by default on your news feed.\nDISCLAIMER: The filtering system is still under development. It may hide things it shouldnâ€™t or miss political posts. HotSwap is improving every day. We apologize any inconveniences this might cause."
