Being an engineer, I always have an eye for User Experience in any product that I use.\n\nSo while watching videos on major OTT platforms, after switching to full screen, I had to hover to check the remaining time and same scenario occurred during college days while preparing for exams, long boring lectures on youtube watching at 2X speed and that too one day before exam, it was hard for me to cope-up with those lectures.\n\nSo in order to ease my life, I developed this extension. After successfully testing it on youtube, extended the support for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney HotStar and many other OTT Platforms."
