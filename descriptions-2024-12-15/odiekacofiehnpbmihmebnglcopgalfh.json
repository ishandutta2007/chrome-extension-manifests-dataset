Upload most file types into your iDoRecall library, consume your content and create linked flashcards. But what about the enormous amount of learning you do on the web?\n\nThe iDoRecall webclipper browser extension enables you to create spaced-repetition flashcards linked to anything you learn on the web. When you practice memory retrieval, if you struggle to recall the answer, click the source button, and the source web page will open and scroll the text or region of interest so that you can refresh your memory in the context where you learned it. The webclipper supports most public-facing web pages.\n\nIf you are watching videos on YouTube, Coursera, Udemy, and other sites, you can create flashcards linked to the time code in the videos where you learned the subject of the flashcard. Click the source button, and the video will open at the linked time.\n\nYou can use the webclipper to create linked flashcards to your Notion notes. Use iDoRecall to ensure you’ll remember everything in your Notion notes you deem important. Don’t just take notes. Remember everything you learn."
