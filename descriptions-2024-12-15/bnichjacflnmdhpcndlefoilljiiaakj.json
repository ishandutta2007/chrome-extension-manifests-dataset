You might want to combine it with fullscreen (F11).\n\nYou can use the left and right directional keys to go to the next/previous page.\n\nYou can use F9 to switch between the \"shrink-to-fit\" mode (which always shows a full page and shrinks it to fit into the browser window - good for higher resolutions) and the \"scroll\" mode (which shows the image with full height and lets you scroll using up/down).\n\nA toast message will appear at the top when a page is supported by HiveNoDistract. Your last settings are saved for each website individually and automatically applied.\n\nNote: The icon comes from http://iconka.com"
