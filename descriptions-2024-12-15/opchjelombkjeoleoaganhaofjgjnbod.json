You can see a selection of options for the area you want to screenshot:\n\n- Custom Area: choose your own area to screenshot\n- Visible Content: screenshot only the content currently visible\n- Full Page: screenshot the whole website\n\nTip: If none of the options work right after adding the extension to chrome, refresh the website you want to screenshot and it should work as expected afterwards.\n\nAfter the screenshot has been taken, you will be redirected to a new tab showcasing the created screenshot with an option to download the image as a PNG.\n\nThe extension is minimalistic and very easy to use without bloat, ads or unnecessary permissions.\n\nThe whole extension is created by an independent developer. You can view the open source project on GitHub: https://github.com/timii/Snapper"
