For me, the comments posted by these individuals are sometimes so unpleasant that they discourage me from wanting to continue participating in discussions on the site.\n\nThis Chrome extension is my attempt to solve that problem. To use it, install the extension, open its options, specify the names of commenters you do not wish to say, optionally check the box indicating that you would also prefer not to see relies to their comments, and click \"Save\". From that point on, every time you view a page with comments on Senator Brownsberger's site, comments from the indicated authors will be replaced with a short message indicating that they have been hidden because you prefer not to see them.\n\nIt is important to note here that I came up with the idea for this extension entirely on my own, without any interaction with or input from Senator Brownsberger or his staff. However, before deciding to publish the extension I did check with Senator Brownsberger to confirm that he did not object to my doing so."
