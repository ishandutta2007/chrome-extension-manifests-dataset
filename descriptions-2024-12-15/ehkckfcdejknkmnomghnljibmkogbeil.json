Click \"Add to Chrome\" and accept.\n2. Type something in your URL bar to make a search.\n3. Click \"Keep Changes\", the smaller button.\n\nAfter you make that first search, Google Chrome tries to ask you to stay with Google, but you can avoid this with the \"Keep Changes\" option, the smaller button.\n\n➤ Features\n* World class, entire web search results.\n* Safe search baked in. Even better than Google's safe search settings.\n* No extension fluff (added tracking or bloatware)\n\n➤Full Web Search Engine\nOther attempts at safe search engines may be too small in scope. They may be useful for searching specific sites, but you only get results from those few pages.\n\nIn other cases, you'll find that the search engines are not built well visually or structurally. You'll find that ABCsearch is the best safe search option on the market."
