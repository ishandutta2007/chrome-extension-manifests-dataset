It helps you stay productive by saving your time and helping you focus on what matters. Secure and Open Source.\n\nüßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è IDEA\n\nWhenever we have to perform any action in from the Danger Zone section of GitHub repository options, such as:\n\n- Change Visibility\n- Transfer Ownership\n- Archive Repository\n- Delete Repository\n\nIt asks to write username/repository-name. It's tedious to write it every time you perform any of these actions or want to quickly get done with it. That's why I created this extension, which lets you quickly type that thing for you and perform the action. Just a single click away.\n\nüîÜ GETTING STARTED\n\nOnce you install it, it will add a button inside your input box to quickly insert the text. Go to the Settings of your repository, under the Danger Zone heading, click on any action. You'll notice the small insert text icon in your input. Click on it to insert the text. A quick GIF for you:\n\nüìã PERMISSIONS\n\nOnly requires content_script permission which only run on the settings page of your repository.\n\nüë®‚Äçüíª CONTRIBUTE\n\nThe extension is completely open source. Feel free to checkout and contribute to it. https://www.saqib.dev/gci\n\nüëã SAY HI!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/saqibameen\nGitHub: https://github.com/saqibameen\nWebsite: https://www.saqib.dev\n\nBy developer, for the developers with ‚ù§Ô∏è."
