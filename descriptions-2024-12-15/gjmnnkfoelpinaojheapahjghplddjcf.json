An alert will pop up and tell you how many business days have passed since that date.\n\nMost standard date formats should work, such as \"Mar 18, 2017\", \"3/18/2017\", etc.\n\nAdditional features may be added in the future, such as adding holidays, a keyboard shortcut, smarter date inferencing, and more.\n\nThis is a free app that was provided to make things easier for many of us. \nYou can contribute to this project at http://cash.me/$mrgnw"
