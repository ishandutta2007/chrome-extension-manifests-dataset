I've developed an extension for Youtube which automatically detects promotions of content creators and fast-forwards through them. Imagine you're watching a podcast and the content creator starts a commercial break which goes on for a minute. Youtube ad fast-forwarder will detect and fast-forward such promos. And of course, I did not forget the native pre-roll ads. They are all fast-forwarded and skipped automatically. \n\nYou can support this project at https://www.buymeacoffee.com/soleh, and meanwhile I can keep improving the service\n\nHere is a more detailed breakdown of the features:\n\n1. Automatic promotion detection. When a Youtuber starts promoting a product the extension will fast-forward the entire part. Please note however, that this is not magic, the algorithm is not perfect, so there will be times where it will fail to detect promotions. I'm constantly working on improving it so it will only get better from here.\n\n2. Youtube ad blocker. A classic feature which detects whenever a Youtube ad is playing and automatically fast-forwarding and skipping it.\n\nCommon questions:\n\nIs the extension free?\n- Yes! As of now there are no costs I need to cover for this extension to work (apart from my time :)) and therefore it's free for everyone. Just install and use it.\n\nDoes the extension collect any private user data?\n- No, nothing of that sort.\n\nHow can I say thank you to the developer?\n- Now, that's a great question. If you could leave a review that would be really nnoice. Also, I would greatly appreciate if you are an active member of the community and you press \"Skip promo\" whenever there is one. If you are feeling suuuper generous you can buy me a coffee at https://www.buymeacoffee.com/soleh\n\nKeywords: Youtube ad blocker, youtube ad skipper, youtube ad fast forwarder, ad, skip, block, sponsorship, promotion, promo, detect, autoskip, auto"
