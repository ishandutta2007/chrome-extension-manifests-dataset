This extension replaces alternative words used by Oklahoma's Thoughtpol with the word that has been banned. The replacement word is left in with a strikethrough to help identify where these replacements have occurred. For example, when using this extension the replacement word 'different' which Oklahoma's Thoughtpol have used to replace all instances of the word 'diversity' will appear as ̶'d̶i̶f̶f̶e̶r̶e̶n̶t diversity.' This extension will be updated as Oklahoma's Thoughtpol add to their list of banned words."
