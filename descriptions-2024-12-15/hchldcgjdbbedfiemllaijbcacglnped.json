Use American Express virtual Cards to help manage budgets specific to projects and maintain visibility and control over spending with spend limits and expiration dates (2).\n\nEnrollment is required and fees may apply.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nInstall Chrome extension to create on-demand virtual Cards to use when paying for business expenses online. After connecting your eligible American Express Card, instead of filling out your Card details, you’ll be able to pay using a virtual Card number at checkout. \n\nTHE BENEFITS OF MELIO SECURE PAYMENT\n- American Express Card Members can earn the rewards of their eligible American Express Card when they use on-demand virtual Cards for business payments.\n\n- Each recipient of an on-demand virtual Card receives a unique 15-digit number, different from the underlying American Express Card funding account number. This means the merchant will not see or store their funding account details.\n\n- Establish specific controls for each virtual Card payment, including spending limits, expiration dates, and allowed merchant categories.\n\n\n(1) Not all Cards are eligible to earn rewards. Terms and limitations vary by Card type. \n\n(2) To generate American Express virtual Cards through Melio Secure Payment, you must be an American Express Corporate or American Express Business Card Member. Eligible American Express Cards are subject to change. To make an American Express Card payment to a vendor through Melio Secure Payment, the vendor must be an American Express-accepting merchant. There is no fee to generate American Express virtual Cards. Certain features, upgrades, and additional payment methods may require separate activations and fees may apply. Melio Secure Payment is solely responsible for determining any and all fees associated with their product. Please contact your Melio Secure Payment representative to learn more."
