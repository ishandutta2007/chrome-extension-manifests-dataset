Or when you have a limited number of reads on a news website until you have to subscribe? Same here, so here's an extension that will intercept those annoying popups and let you read that article.\n\n\nThere are millions of websites and it's impossible to know them all. So if you have any other website that needs bypassing, please let me know in the support section."
