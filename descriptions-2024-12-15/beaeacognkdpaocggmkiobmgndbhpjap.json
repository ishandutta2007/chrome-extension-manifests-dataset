Looking it up should be pretty simple, too. This straightforward extension looks up your computer's IP address upon request. That's it. Just click or hover over the icon and there's your IP. Simple.\n\nThere are other tools out there that do the same thing, but I wanted to make this as easy and speedy as possible, not bloated like other apps. \n\nThis extension also provides a real-time lookup of your IP address which is useful for connecting to proxies or private networks when you need to quickly know if your IP address has changed. All you have to do is click the button or just hover, you don't even have to type anything!"
