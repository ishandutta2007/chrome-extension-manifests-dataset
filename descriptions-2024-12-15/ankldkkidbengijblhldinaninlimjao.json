No registration is necessary!\n\nHow does it help:\nAmazon prices vary from one country to another and especially for more expensive products, their prices vary a whole lot more. If you are looking for your next phone, that flagship model at amazon.de can be cheaper than amazon.fr. \n\nWhilst you may have Prime on one account or the other, most of the Amazon products can be shipped all around Europe. It will just take a bit longer, but the savings have proven to be immense!\n\nWe are not only giving you a simple solution but also simplifying your shopping experience.\n\nWe currently support:\n- Amazon Germany (amazon.de)\n- Amazon Spain (amazon.es)\n- Amazon Italy (amazon.it)\n- Amazon France (amazon.fr)"
