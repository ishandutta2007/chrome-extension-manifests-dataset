Stay focused and increase productivity today!\n\nWhite noise contains equal amounts of all frequencies and has the same intensity at different frequencies, making it sound like a hissing noise. It is often used to mask other noises, such as outside traffic or conversations, which can help people focus or relax. White noise can also be used to help people sleep, as the sound helps block out distractions and steady the listener's breathing."
