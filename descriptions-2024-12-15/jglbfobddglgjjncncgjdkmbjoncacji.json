The background dimmer can be changed individually from the sharp text highlight.\n\nThe extension uses a fullscreen HTML5 Canvas and will attempt to emulate the shape of your browsers selection as efficiently and accurately as possible, so that it works in a way that is very familiar to you already.\n\nNexii (the developer) has been using this for more than half a year and swears by it. By no means perfect, but once you use it you won't go back :)\n\n======\n\nVersion 8\n--------\n- Updated shape algorithms (Rounding works somewhat better)\n- Added and enabled Selection settings\n-- Similar to background dim settings, but you can also change line width\n- Fixed selection colour\n\n\nVersion 7\n--------\n- Newer options backend\n- Enabled Dim settings\n- Added padding. You can control how far or close the background dim is\n- Added blur. You can now blur the background dim, to avoid harsh edges\n\nVersion 4\n--------\n- Improved algorithm\n- Hide Fokal when using right-click context menu, to avoid “Inspect” mode accidentally hitting the Fokal canvas\n- Disabled all options temporarily while coming up with newer settings menu"
