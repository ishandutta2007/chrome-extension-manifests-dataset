In our current economic environment, however, these companies are beholden not only to their stakeholders, but also their shareholders. It is easy to forget that Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp are all publicly traded under the symbol, '$FB'.\n\nTo that end, DollarVision replaces many of the Western world's most prolific IPs with their stock abbreviation. It is not so much a critique as a simple visual reminder of the economic implications of businesses, journalism, and the web.\n\nThe list of replacements is not exhaustive, and will be updated in the future.\n\nAn additional note of interest is the way in which the extension highlights the limitation of language. Are we referring to Amazon the company, or Amazon the rainforest? Apple the computer, or apple, the fruit? Moreover all of a company's respective assets will appear the same - as with Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp - therefore sacrificing specificity."
