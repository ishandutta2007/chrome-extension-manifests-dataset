Atlassian doesn’t offer this out of the box, so we created an extension that can change the white light of the Jira Service Management to black.\n\nNEVER STRAIN YOUR EYES AGAIN\nThe dark skin will do what the name implies. But for greater comfort, we added the possibility to tweak the contrast and brightness of the colors.\n\nDon’t forget about the Night Shift to save your eyes from straining. Shift the color scheme from blue to warm and minimize the harmful effects on your eyesight.\n\nMAINTAIN A HEALTHY SLEEP CYCLE WITH NIGHT SHIFT\nExcessive exposure to blue light that comes from the computer screen can mess up your sleep. Therefore, we added Night Shift, which you can turn on and off when needed. It will change the blue light to soft, warm tones to reduce the risk of insomnia and other health issues."
