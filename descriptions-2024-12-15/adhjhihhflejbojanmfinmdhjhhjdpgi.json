L = List, A = Alumni, M = Motivation, P = Posting. It is a list largely composed of companies for which you want to work for, have current job postings and have alumni/connections. This extension helps with the connections part of the process. When on designated pages and with one click of a button, the important information for a potential contact is split into separate fields (First Name, Last Name, Company Name, etc.), thus allowing for easy editing of the pre-filled fields and adding of the contact to your lamp list."
