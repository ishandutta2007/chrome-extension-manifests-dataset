It's blocklist is based on regular Internet-wide security scans which are conducted within a scientific research project.\n\nMade by the Institute of IT Security Research (https://www.fhstp.ac.at/en/research/institute-of-it-security-research) at the St. PÃ¶lten University of Applied Sciences\n\nIn our research project PriSAd we examined cryptojacking on the web. Cryptojacking is the process of mining for cryptocurrencies inside a website visitor's web browser without their consent. While doing this with the consent of the user, for instance to replace incomes from advertisements, it is a legitimate application. Cryptojacking, however, abuses the user's resources such as the battery of a mobile device.\n\nWe periodically scan the Alexa Top 1 million websites for cryptojacking and perform various analyses. Additionally, we use the results to create a blocklist, which effectively blocks hidden cryptojacking on the web.\n\n\nCoinEater is open source software and licensed under MIT.
