The Save to Facebook Chrome extension lets you save all those interesting things you see on the Internet, and easily find them later. \n\nGET ORGANIZED\nWhen you save an item from the Internet to Facebook, we help you keep it organized by presenting you with collection options. Add the item you want to save to an existing collection, or create a new one-- it’ll be easier to find when you’re ready to view or share it later. You can create as many collections as you like, and name them whatever you want. \n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY (until you share it)\nOnly you can view and access your saved items, which are stored in your own private Saved Items list. From there, you can share your saved items on your timeline, in a group, or elsewhere on Facebook. You can also share a whole collection of saved items with a select group of friends using the Shared Collections feature.\n\nSEE YOUR SAVES FROM ANYWHERE\nYou can quickly access your saved items and collections on Facebook, no matter where your browser takes you. Once you click the Save to Facebook icon, click “View All” link in the upper right corner and your Saved list opens in a separate window. \n\n\nNext time you find interesting content at an inconvenient moment, just use the Save to Facebook extension. When you’re ready to view it, select “Saved & Collections” on the menu to the left of Facebook News Feed, or type www.facebook.com/saved in your browser.\n\nLearn more about Saved & Collections on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/help/516581611792218?helpref=related.\n\nBy using this feature, you agree to Facebook's Data Policy and terms of service, available at https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms and https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy"
