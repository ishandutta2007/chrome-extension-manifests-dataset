You can make your time on this website much more enjoyable!\n\nInstalling the extensions adds subtle elements to the page's UI. On every review or comment, there is a small button that opens a collapsible menu that can be used to add the user to a blacklist. The action is reversible and very easy to undo.\n\nTo easily manage the list of blocked users or to add users without searching for their posts, you can use the Popup. It can be activated by clicking the extension icon right next to the address bar.\n\nThe extension is easy to use, completely free, and open-source. It does not collect any user data."
