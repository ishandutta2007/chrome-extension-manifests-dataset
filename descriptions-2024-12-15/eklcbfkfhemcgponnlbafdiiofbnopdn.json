But it's not perfect..\nThe new layout displays the data visualisations (in the \"Performance\" report, for example) in a boxed area that limits how much data you can see at one time - that's where GSC Full Width comes in. \n\nThe extension is extremely lightweight - a few kb in total - and will not slow down page load times. It seamlessly modifies the layout in such a way that you won't even know it's there until you visit Search Console without the extension. \n\nThere are no bells and whistles, no options menus, no set up at all required - just install and go. \n\nChange log: \n- 1.1.5: Updated to fix full-width view when left menu was closed. \n\nExtension created in partnership with Alpha Digital (https://alphadigital.com.au)"
