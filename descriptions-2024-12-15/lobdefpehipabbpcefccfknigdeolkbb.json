However, this process is tedious as I have to manually open up Goodreads and search for the book before I can actually click that button.\n\nThis Chrome extension removes the need for multiple steps. Just click on the 'View in Goodreads' button to directly open up that book's Goodreads page. Easy as! \n\nHappy reading!"
