It's all about keeping it safe simple and helping people.  \n\nUsage example:\n\nIf the user types: \"Hi guys, welcome to my show\" and \"Hi guys, welcome to my home\"\nthen for any future typing of \"Hi guys\" or \"Hi guys, welcome\"(or any other sub string) the extension will open a panel containing the corresponding 2 sentences from above.\n\nI think that this feature is a MUST for bloggers/journalists and anyone who write a lot on the computer. \n\n**** Please let me know if you're having issues with it so I could fix them ASAP ****\n\nYou can contact me directly at nativ@pipl.cool."
