Therefore, the direction of qibla should be determined correctly. We use various tools to find the direction of qibla.\n\nWe can use online maps to find the right direction of qibla. We can use the sites that give the qibla direction line of our location and the qibla angle for the compass. Qiblafind.com, which uses the Google maps infrastructure, is one of them. You can use the relevant site to learn our Qibla direction with the correct result.\n\nWith this study, we aim to find our Qibla direction quickly from the online map. You can quickly learn all the countries and cities of the world, or the direction of qibla of your current location here."
