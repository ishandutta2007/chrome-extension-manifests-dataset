The extension starts with only YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, Amazon and Hulu activated. \n\nWhen a video begins to play, you'll see a camera icon appear alongside the normal player controls. Each time you click the camera button or a keyboard shortcut of your choosing, a screenshot is created of the video from its current frame. The screenshot is then either saved in your downloads folder as a JPG or PNG, or copied to your clipboard. There are additional options such as reporting an issue with the extension and donating to the developer.\n\nSince this extension is reliant on other websites, it will need to be updated periodically as those websites evolve. Please contact me directly if you have issues with this extension on either of these sites, or if you have any suggestions!"
