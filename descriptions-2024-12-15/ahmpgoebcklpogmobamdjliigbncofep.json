However, this is not a comprehensive text parser so please let me know if you find any issues. \n\nUnlike the example taken from the aforementioned Wikipedia page, for a word like \"couldn't\", I have chosen to fix the first character and also the last three (i.e. \"n't\") and then scramble all the rest; I found that the words get much harder to decipher if this approach is not taken!"
