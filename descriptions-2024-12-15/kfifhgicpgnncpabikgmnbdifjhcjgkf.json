Travco is a website which offers wide variety of tools used by the players of Travian to coordinate their actions in the game.\n\nSince Travian does not offer public API, it has always been a common practice to copy & paste the page HTML source code into third-party sites (like Travco) which then parse relevant information from the input data. \n\nThis extension simplifies the process by allowing the players to send the page HTML to Travco directly, with a single click. In return, the users are shown a notification about the result. In some cases (for example, when the parsed result requires further processing, or an error occurs), a new window with relevant information on Travco website may be opened.\n\nInstructions:\nUsage is super simple:\n  1. download this extension into your browser\n  2. pin it in the extensions tab\n  3. click the extension image to report currently active page to Travco*\n*First time you'll use the extension you will be instructed to insert an API key to the extension. This is so that the extension can communicate with Travco securely. You can get your API key at https://www.travcotools.com/user/api-token/."
