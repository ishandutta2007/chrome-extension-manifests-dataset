Anything we don't understand out of the box, you can select the data yourself in a few clicks and easily it right into the Clay sheet.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nYou can skip manual copy-pasting from online lists, or that same data you keep grabbing from company/people profile pages, and use our simple data selection tool to map and download the exact data points you need from any website using only a URL.\n\nü§ì Find auto-detected lists. See a list you like on a website? Pop open the extension to check if it's been auto-detected, and add it to Clay.\n\nüßê Map your own lists. If a list isn't detected or you want to pull in a few more attributes, map your own lists and add it as new leads in Clay.\n\nüò≤ Map page recipes. Instead of manually copy-pasting the same data from similarly structured pages into your table, pull important attributes from any website into Clay using just a URL.\n\nTake a peek at our more extensive guide to the Chrome Extension in the Clay Library right here: https://docs.clay.com/how-to-use-clay/chrome-extension\n\nABOUT CLAY\nWe believe identifying prospects is an art, and growing users and community is a skill, but the manual searching, collecting and filling out of row after row with the same data is a waste of your team's time. So, we built the world's first spreadsheet that fills itself to help automate your sales, marketing, or recruiting.\n\nEvery company is unique in identifying and understanding their ideal customer (it's the special sauce). Clay connects to third party APIs, enrichment providers, and your internal tools to help you setup flexible, extensible workflows that pull in exactly the data you care about, automatically."
