This keeps all staff in the loop about what has been done so far, saving embarrassment when having to check with customers.\n- Search for any text in the note body with a live search function, or filter by name, status, type, or all at once!\n- Edit and Updates in Ajax, so no need to refresh the page\n- Auto-expanding 'steps' when creating or editing a note, allowing rapid data entry that works with you, not against you.\n- Auto-hides the cumbersome 'bubble' display above email replies, compacting everything in to the extension popup screen.\n- A useful counter badge on the icon, showing you how many notes there are on the page. This goes green when all tickets are not escalated, and red when at least one is.\n\nNo known bugs. Please note that this extension uses JSON formatting to overwrite the note body. If you use it to edit any existing notes in your software, you will be overwriting the format of that note to use the new JSON formatting. I take no responsibility should this not be desired in your business environment, so please check with your management team that this extension has been approved prior to this.\n\nAlternatively you can just 'not' use the editing features, and use it to display notes in a nice, clean interface. When you need to edit an existing note or add a new one, you can click the drop down above the search bar to show/hide the original ticket display."
