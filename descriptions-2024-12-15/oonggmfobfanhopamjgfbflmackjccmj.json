Once the extension is added, two small icons should appear next to each player's name on the Live Scoring page - the camera icon links to that player's live stream, and the field icon links to that player's MLB.com Gameday feed. Now you don't have to waste time searching Google/Reddit for streams of your players every time you want to watch an at-bat, just one click and you're good!\n\nCHANGELOG:\n1.1: Changed Washington Nationals abbreviation from \"WAS\" to \"WSH\"\n1.2: Updated URL change for foodexsport streaming service used for declutter.js\n1.3: Updated content.js, page format changed and broke my code so needed to update\n1.4: Updated URL string for Arizona Diamondbacks from \"diamondbacks\" to \"d-backs\"\n1.5: Added MLB Gameday icon next to video stream icon that links to the MLB Gameday page for each player's team\n1.5.1: Bug fix for the Live Scoring page, icons weren't showing up on the Period setting\n1.5.2: Video streaming URL changed from foodexsports.com to volokit.com, updated code to recognize that\n1.5.3: Video streaming URL changed from volokit.com/mlb-games/* to volokit.com/volostream/mlb-games/*"
