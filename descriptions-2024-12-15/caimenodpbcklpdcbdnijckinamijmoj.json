Well, here's your chance to change that! Hidden Impressions is a tool that helps brands build better content for consumers like you. \n\nTo help make brands make better content for you, we need to know what you think about the content already out there. That's why Inkblot Analytics came out with the Hidden Impressions extension for Chrome. Use our app to take a quick screen shot of the things you see online that capture your attention. It could be a blog post, a news article, a new product--whatever you can find on the web that you feel compelled to share with us. Then tell us what you took a screen shot of, and why you like it.\n\nWe'll do the rest from there. We can't wait to see what kind of online content catches your attention. So start using our Chrome extension today.\n\nFind out more at: https://www.inkblotanalytics.com/hidden-impressions?hsLang=en"
