Many sites include long irrelevant strings of text in the URL bar that include tracking and advertising data that aren't friendly to share. Clicking the icon or pressing Alt+C will activate this extension, and the keyboard shortcut can be changed in your browser's extensions page. Defaults to Option+C for MacOS.\n\nThis extension removes the query string, and hashtag references, and will further remove irrelevant data on supported sites to get to a short URL more appropriate for sharing.\n\nSites currently supported for enhanced shortening:\n\n - eBay items (removes item description from URL)\n - Amazon items (removes item description and referrer from URL)\n - YouTube videos (removes playlist and start time from URL)\n - Local File URLs (copies a local path instead of URL)\n\nFor file:// urls that are on your local hard drive, Alternative Copy will put the native path string into the clipboard, and will surround the path with quotes if it contains any spaces. For example, file:///C:/Projects/AlternativeCopy/Test%20File%20URL.txt would copy as \"C:\\Projects\\AlternativeCopy\\Test File URL.txt\" (windows), and file:///Temp/AlternativeCopy/TestFile.txt would copy as /Temp/AlternativeCopy/TestFile.txt (linux, BSD, MacOS)."
