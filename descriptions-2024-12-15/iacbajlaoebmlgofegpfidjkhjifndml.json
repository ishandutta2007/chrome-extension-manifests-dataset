With this extension, users can quickly access a comprehensive list of drug interactions and their degree of danger (high/low) from the ONCHigh NIH database.\n\nUsing the Medicine Interaction Checker is straightforward. Users can open the extension from anywhere in Chrome, and input the name or identification code of their medication. The extension will then generate a table that includes all the relevant drug interactions and their corresponding level of danger.\n\nDrug interactions can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous, causing medications to become less effective or producing unexpected side effects. By using the Medicine Interaction Checker, users can have a better understanding of how their medications may interact with each other and take appropriate steps to manage any potential risks.\n\nOverall, the Medicine Interaction Checker is an essential tool for anyone taking prescription medications and wanting to ensure their health and well-being."
