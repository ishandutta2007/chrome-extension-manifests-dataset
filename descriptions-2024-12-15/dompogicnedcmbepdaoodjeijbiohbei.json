Release to restore speed!\nHold H Video Speed Controller lets you adjust the playback speed of any HTML5 video on popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, and Bilibili... Not only does this extension allow you to set the speed to whatever you desire (possibly greater than 2), you can also temporarily change the speed to a desired value (3 by default) by holding down the H key! \nIf you want to fast forward some parts of a video but still would like to quickly slow down (or vice versa), this extension is made just for you! Changing the speed no longer requires interacting with the UI so you're able to easily switch between two preset speeds with only the H key!"
