If your internet connection isn't the best, this extension was built for you! This will alleviate the irritating buffering times you experience and stops the player from crashing unexpectedly.\n\nHave a try for yourself and feel free to send me feedback via email or in person, I can be found in the Medical center and along South Ridge on most days.\n\nEnjoy, I hope this makes studying just that little bit easier!\n\n[Known unresolved issues] \nIf a video was published on a year different to the year you did/are doing the subject, it generally will not load (ie. did the subject in 2015, lecture video was from 2014)."
