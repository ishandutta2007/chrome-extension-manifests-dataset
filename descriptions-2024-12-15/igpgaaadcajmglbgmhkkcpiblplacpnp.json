This measure helps slowing the spread of the virus and reduces the number of patients in hospitals.\n\nSocial distancing  together with the news-frenzy around the pandemic can bring as a side-effect a collective information overload. This creates difficulty for individuals to understand the situation and effectively make decisions around it, all because there is too much information about the topic. This results in ever growing levels of anxiety which consequently hamper the mental health of citizens.\n\n In the spirit of Social Distancing: \"Tweet Distancing\" was created to disrupt the layout of Twitter by limiting tweets to one per page.  This underwhelms the user dissuading him from consuming too much information.\n\nKeep your body and mind safe: practice Social Distancing and Tweet Distancing."
