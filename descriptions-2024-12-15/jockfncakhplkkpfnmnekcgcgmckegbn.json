It can be used at any time in the event you wish to check something or switch off the bundles temporarily (e.g. while a release is going on). Upon using this function, the administrator in the company is notified that the bundles have been switched off or on (via email) & with instructions on how to turn them off or on as the case may be.\n\n- Remove listings: from time to time, it is likely that you may encounter bundles that you wish to remove for one reason or another. These listings can be taken off by clicking the \"Remove\" icon next to the listing.\n \nNote: there may be a 15-minute delay in totally removing the listing from the page.\n\nIn case you face any issues with this or anything else to do with the Increasingly extension or service, please write to us at hello@increasingly.com"
