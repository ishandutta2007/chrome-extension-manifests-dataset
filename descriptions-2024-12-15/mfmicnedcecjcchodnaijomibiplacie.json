To do this, you can simply select \"1947\" -> right-click -> \"Save as flashcard on LearnAwesome\".\n\n\"1947\" will become the answer and the surrounding text like \"India got its independence in ___ ?\" will become the question. You will get a chance to edit these before saving. The URL of the page will also be saved. This lets you practice flashcards topic-wise."
