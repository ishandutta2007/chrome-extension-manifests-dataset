PLEASE MAKE SURE TO DISABLE ANY OTHER TWITCH SPECIFIC AD BLOCKERS !!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe extension works by finding a Twitch stream source without ads and replacing the ad with the ad-less version. The ad-less version will be 480p, while the ad runs.\n\nTwitch Ads will be blocked for pre-rolls and mid-rolls and also on VOD's. We also block third party trackers.\n\nNo personal information is needed or collected. \n\nAny donations are very much welcome, as we do pay server costs to make this work.\nYou can donate via Paypal at https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ttvadblock\n\n\n\n\nYou can find our code on Github and keep up to date with any changes. https://github.com/DonnyJones/AdblockerForTwitch\n\nThe code is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license.
