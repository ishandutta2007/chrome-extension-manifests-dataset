Remind yourself to make the most of everyday with this browser extension.\n\n\"If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you'll be right. Every morning I looked in the mirror and asked myself: If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I do today?\" â€” Steve Jobs\n\nThis work was inspired by the following article on Wait But Why: https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html\n\nAll visualization preferences are stored locally to protect your privacy."
