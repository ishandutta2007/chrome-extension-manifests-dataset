The extension works by scanning the text on web pages in real-time and identifying any words or phrases that are deemed offensive or inappropriate based on a pre-defined list of criteria.\n\nWhen the extension detects offensive language, it can take various actions to filter it out, such as replacing it with asterisks. Other option that will be added in new versions are: removing offensive language altogether, or warning the user with a pop-up notification. The user can customize the settings of the extension to suit their preferences and adjust the level of filtering or blocking that is applied.\n\nThis type of extension can be useful for individuals who are sensitive to offensive language or want to protect themselves or their children from harmful or inappropriate content online. It can also be helpful for organizations or schools that want to ensure a safe and respectful environment for their members or students."
