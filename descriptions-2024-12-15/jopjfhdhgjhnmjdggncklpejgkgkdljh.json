In this game, a horizontal board is randomly placed in the game area, while your shooter sits at the bottom left corner. With only 10 balls to use, your objective is to hit the board by perfectly adjusting the angle and speed of your shots.\n\nHow to Play?\n\n1) Move your mouse left and right to adjust the shooter's angle.\n2) Click and hold on the screen to set the ball's initial speedâ€”longer presses mean higher speed.\n3) The ball follows a parabolic trajectory due to simulated gravity.\n4) If your shot hits the board, it collapses, earning you points and awarding an extra ball.\n5) If you miss, keep trying until all your balls are used up.\n\nStrategy:\n\n- Master the angle and speed of your shots to account for the board's position and gravity.\n- Plan each shot carefully to maximize your score and conserve your limited supply of balls.\n\nChallenge yourself to beat your high score, displayed at the top right corner."
