My personal investment is sorting by level and by dependency. The website likes to put reagents in weird order like Holy Rainbow Cloth – Holy Water. My script detects and reverts the wrong order.\nAnd what is also cool is that website has all languages support. My script doesnt care about languages it parses names as they are so you get the correct scenario for Miqobot regardless.\n\nI think Miqo said there will be something similar in Miqobot one day. But until then – youre welcome\n\n\nHow to use: \n1. Go to recipe book: http://ffxivcrafting.com/recipes . Use search by name and button on the right to make your crafting list.\n2. Go to your crafting list: http://ffxivcrafting.com/list . Press the green button “Craft These Items”.\n3. Go through sections #1 and #2 and upload these into your inventory. If youre a hoarder like me you should have everything in your retainers. Click on those youve obtained its a cool visual progress.\n4. Press the \"=ㅇㅅㅇ=\" button at the top of the page.\n5. Paste the script into your miqo scenario\n6. Run scenario, sit back as Miqo crafts everything for you :D"
