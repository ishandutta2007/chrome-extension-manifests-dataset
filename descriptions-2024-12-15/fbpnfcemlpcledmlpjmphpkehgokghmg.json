User can copy the graph(or scene data) by select the graph they want and using command(or ctrl) + C from Excalidraw and then paste it into Notion. This extension will render the Excalidraw scene data to an image and paste it as an image block to notion. And user can copy the graph from notion image block pasted above by click the button in the block and then paste back to Excalidraw and modify it.  It's really helpful for those user who loves Notion and Excalidraw and want to make figures by Excalidraw and use them in Notion."
