Oh, and she'll stop for captchas too!\n\nWith one click, you can...\n\n-- Share Your Entire Closet To All Your Followers\n-- Share Your Entire Closet To Active Parties\n-- Follow All Of Your Followers\n-- Follow Any Other Closet's Followers\n-- Return A Share For Each Of Your Received Shares\n-- Update All Of Your Listings (Edit-Next-Share Method)\n-- Share X Number Of Items From Anyone's Closet\n-- Share X Number Of Items From Any Brand Page\n\nYou can also schedule your sharing and following...\n\n-- Schedule Shares To Followers\n-- Schedule Shares To Parties\n-- Schedule Updating Your Listings (Edit-Next-Share Method)\n-- Schedule Return Following\n-- Schedule Return Sharing\n\nWith the scheduling feature, you can just leave your computer on and let Betty handle it at the time you set!\n\nBetty will also...\n\n- Let you set the speed of your sharing and following (slow, medium, or fast)\n- Alert you of CAPTCHAs and stop until you've solved them\n\nTake back your time AND increase your potential sales!\n\nCloset Betty was built by actual Poshmark users who were frustrated with the intense time requirements of sharing, following, and updating. We wanted more time with our families and less time in front of a screen. And so we built Betty to act like a real person, doing exactly what we would do.\n\nNo questionable methods are used. Betty simply drives your web browser the way you would, times her clicks the way you would, and even stops to handle CAPTCHAs the way you would.\n\nGive it a try! We hope you'll like it!"
