However, while it's able to capture complicated hierarchies of blocking issues, it's not very good at displaying these hierarchies.\n\nThis extension allows you to view how deeply-nested you're blockers have become, at the epic, issue, and subtask level. It graphs out the relationships between the issues on whichever Jira page you opened the extension on, so you can visualize a single issue and its subtasks, an epic, this sprint, or your entire backlog."
