AutoTabGroup's aim to streamline this process, and handle this tedious task for you, so you only have to set up your tab configuration one time, and then every time you visit a website you've configured in a rule, your tab will automatically get added to the proper tab group.\n\nConfiguration Notes:\nA minimal functional configuration includes at least one tab group, with one or more rules.\n\nWhen configuring rules, you can enable \"Wildcard\" matching, which will match any direct sub-domains as well as the domain entered. For example, entering \"youtube.com\" in the Domain field with wildcard enabled, would match youtube.com, www.youtube.com, music.youtube.com, etc.\n\nWildcard matching will only match immediate sub-domains. From the example above, this rule would not match www.music.youtube.com, only music.youtube.com."
