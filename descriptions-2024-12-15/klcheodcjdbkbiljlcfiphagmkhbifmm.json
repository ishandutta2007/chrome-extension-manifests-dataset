This process requires some in-depth technical understanding, time, and generally leads to frustration.\n\nLinkFrame is an alternative to setting up you own DNS to surf Handshake domains.\n\nInstall an extension, and you're ready to go.\n\nExtension currently supports:\n - resolving domains which lead to IP addresses\n - resolving domains which lead to SIA Skynet hashes\n - resolving domains which lead to dns.live redirects\n - resolving domains which lead to normal redirects\n\nThere is plans to support:\n - resolving domains which lead to IPFS hashes\n\nThis extension allows you to configure any Handshake node as a base node for domain resolution. By default extension will use public node maintained by EasyChain team.\n\nCurrently extension is in its alpha stage, so feedback is appreciated.\nPlease, use GitHub Issues to request features/submit bugs: https://github.com/execc/link-frame/issues"
