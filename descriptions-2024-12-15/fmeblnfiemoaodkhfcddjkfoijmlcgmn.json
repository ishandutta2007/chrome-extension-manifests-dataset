Each video contains a screen recording and any logs, http requests, storage changes, user actions made.\n\nHave you found a bug and need to write down steps to reproduce? No need, just record it with Whitespace and attach the link to the bug report.\n\nFound some weird behaviour and want to show it to an engineer? Don't use a regular screen recording, it will only show what happened, not why! Just record it with Whitespace and send to link through slack/teams/email.\n\nWant to get feedback on something you're developing? Recording it with Whitespace to get a pixel-perfect recording in seconds. Whitespace doesn't compress your recording in any way, so no quality is lost."
