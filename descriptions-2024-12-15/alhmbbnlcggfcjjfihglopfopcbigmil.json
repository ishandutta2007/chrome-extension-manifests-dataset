And additionally, nobody knows you're online if you don't want to.\n\nFEATURES\n--------\n+ Adds a new menu in WhatsApp™ Web that lets you toggle on and off the sending of:\n   - Read receipts for messages (two blue ticks mark)\n   - \"Last Seen\" updates (presence) and \"typing\"\n+ Works for groups\n+ Works for statuses/stories\n+ Restores all deleted messages\n+ See if a message was sent from a phone or a computer\n+ Lets you download statuses\n+ When read receipts are blocked, the unread messages counteres show up transperent, and when you read them they turn red. This helps to tell when you are in invisible mode and it is safe to click on chats.\n\n+ If you want to mark a spesific chat as read anyway, you can open the sub-menu of it and choose \"mark as read\". A warning will show up and when you confirm, a read receipt will be sent.\n\nGitHub repo: \nhttps://github.com/tomer8007/whats-incognito\n\nPRIVACY\n--------\nNo data is ever transmitted to anywhere. \nPrivacy Policy here: https://github.com/tomer8007/whatsapp-web-incognito/wiki/Chrome-Extension-Privacy-Policy\n\n————————————————————\nLEGAL\n————————————————————\n\nWhatsApp is a trademark of WhatsApp Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.
