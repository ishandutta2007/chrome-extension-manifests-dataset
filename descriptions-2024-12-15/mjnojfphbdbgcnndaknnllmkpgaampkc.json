---\nAs Forget Me Not is in the business of protecting your privacy we believe the best way to prevent the sale or sharing of your data is to never collect it in the first place, that is why we attest

unique user data at any time in the future.\n\n--- Examples of Data Stored ---\nAll of your site and global options are stored securely within Chrome’s sync storage which is tied to the Google account you are using with Chrome, and can only be accessed by the extension itself and cannot be retrieved via a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The benefit of using sync storage is that these stored options travel with you on any computer that you install Forget Me Not on, don’t worry, your options are automatically cleared if you decide to uninstall the extension.\n\n  ●  Site Option\n      {\n         \"google.com\": {\n         \"beaconBlocking\": true,\n          \"blocking\": false,\n         \"fingerprintBlocking\": true,\n         \"matchLevel\": 1,\n         \"persistData\": true\n         }\n      }\n  ●  Global Options\n      {\n         \"notifyOnClearing\": true\n      },\n      {\n         \"clearCacheOnClearingData\": false\n      },\n      {\n         \"crossSiteCookieRemoval\": true\n      },\n      {\n         \"notifyOnCrossSiteCookieRemoval\": true\n      }"
