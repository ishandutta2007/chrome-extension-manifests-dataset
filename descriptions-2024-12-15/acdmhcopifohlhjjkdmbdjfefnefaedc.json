My browser extension makes it easier by giving you a simple way to see how a movie ranks within its genre.\n\nJust go to the IMDB website and you'll see a \"genre bubble\" next to the movie poster. The number in the bubble shows how well the movie is rated compared to others in that genre. For example, a 98 means the movie is in the top 2% of all movies in that genre. The extension also works for TV shows, and they are ranked separately from movies.\n\nThe formatting of the rank value can be customized by using the popup window for the extension."
