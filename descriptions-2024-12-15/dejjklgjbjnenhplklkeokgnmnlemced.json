The more you review, the more you remember.\nThis learning technique trains your memory to absorb information on a deeper level, to be recalled and used at any time. Some call it spaced repetition — we call it reflection.\n\nTake your pile of ever-growing notes stored in the cloud, and let Reflect turn it into an archive of knowledge stored in your mind.\n\nUse Reflect for memorising clippings from your e-books, reviewing lecture notes, keeping ideas and thoughts fresh in your mind. Enjoy Reflect on desktop, tablet and smart phone, 24/7.\n\nEvernote may be your digital memory, brilliantly storing your thoughts, ideas, notes and clippings. But what if you don’t regularly review and reflect on the important stuff? It gets lost, buried under new notes, or forgotten in a rarely visited corner of your mind.\n\nReflect helps you memorise and reflect on your notes, by scheduling regular flashcards reviews of what you’ve saved in Evernote.\n\nCall it the “eat little and often” approach to learning and reflection. When you take smaller bites, at regular intervals, you digest things easier.\n\nReflect in any place, at any time\nReflect works on any device — mobile, tablet or desktop. Got a spare 5 minutes? Just launch Reflect and away you go.\n\nFind hidden treasure\nReflect races through your archive and presents your notes to you. Rediscover the hidden value of your Evernote account.\n\nStress-free learning\nUse filters to choose the schedule and frequency of flashcard reviews and notifications. Perhaps during morning coffee? Or after dinner?\n\nTo use this extension you need a free Reflect account. You will be shown instructions after you have completed the installation.\n\nAre you an Amazon Kindle user?\nWe have partnered with the very useful Clippings.io which lets you organize the notes you make on your Kindle and exports them to Evernote.
