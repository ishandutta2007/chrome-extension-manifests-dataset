Trends, who to follow, and the messages tab are too noisy for me so I decided to build this extension to remove those.\n\nThe extension removes components that are less important than just reading the feed (at least for me :wink ).\n\nRemoves the following components:\n- \"Search Twitter\"\n- \"Trends for you\"\n- \"Who to follow\"\n- \"Explore\" link\n- \"Tweet\" button\n- \"Messages\" tab on footer\n- dropdown icon on profile link\n- likes counter\n- retweets counter\n- comments/ sub-tweets counter\n- who liked a Tweet\n- who retweeted a Tweet\n- footer\n\nBenefits\n- Your decision to like and retweet will be based on the content of the Tweet instead of depending on the numbers/ counter.\n- You won't be distracted with the trends. Less stress IMO.\n- You won't be able to see the annoying \"Messages\" tab. Who decided to put this and didn't put a close button ?!\n\nCode is open source\nhttps://github.com/earvinpiamonte/twitter-stripped-chrome"
