Since I didn't find useful extension that highlights the DUTCH companies (mainly for H1B or UK visa :/ So I decided to build one for myself! Leave the comment if there is any bugs or it also helps you.\n\nTo highlight content on other webpages, download the source code and add them to Chrome's developer mode in the extensions page (chrome://extensions/) and modify the company data, URL, and class name properties.\n\nRepo source code: \nhttps://github.com/wentungwen/dutch_sponsorship_companies_highlighter\n\nMy LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/wentungwen/"
