After installing the extension, visit the site (e.g. techcrunch.com) and hit control + m. You should see a textarea to the right of the browser window. Insert your custom CSS into it and view the results.\n\nThis CSS will be reinserted upon revisiting the site, thereby saving your styles. Pressing control + m once more will hide the textarea, but your contents will still be retained.\n\nSee https://github.com/karthikv/my-style (scroll down) for an example.\n\nTo speed up the process of styling, if you hold alt while clicking an element, a selector for that element will automatically be appended to the textarea editor. With this, you can circumvent the time it takes to inspect the element to find how to target it.\n\nHow it Works:\nMy Style is quite simple. It inserts a textarea into the page, looks for changes to the textarea's contents, and updates a dynamically inserted style tag appropriately. My Style employs local storage to make CSS changes persistent. It uses simple technologies for a simple result.\n\nIcon made by Freepik (https://www.freepik.com/) from FlatIcon (http://www.flaticon.com)"
