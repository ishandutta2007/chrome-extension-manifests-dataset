However, it is hidden away and easy to forget about.\n\nThis extension solves that problem by re-surfacing the status of your experiments into a small emoji on your inventory page where it's more likely to be seen and encourage you to run more tests, improve your listings, and make more sales.\n\nYou can now quickly glance to see the progress on your experiments from the inventory page."
