That’s why we’ve developed the Fundraising Copy Checker to assist fundraisers with writing better copy. \n\nThis extension for Google Chrome will help you to more easily check the copy that you want to use in your fundraising and engagement communications. By using the copy checker, you can feel more confident that what you’ve written will help you to further engage with your wider community. Whether you’re asking them to donate, respond to event invitations or to volunteer.  \n\nIt’s important to note that this copywriting extension is not yet a grammar or spelling checker (we’re working on it). It does, however, check for the following:\n\nHow donor-led your copy is\nHow you use words to convey enthusiasm, rather than punctuation\nHow lengthy and/or complex sentences might be\nConfusing or unnecessary words\nAdverbs and weakening phrases\nUse of the passive voice\n\nTo get feedback on copy that’s already been published to the web, simply follow these instructions:\n\n1. Install this extension.\n2. Once installed, select the purple Hubbub avatar icon, located in the top right-hand corner of your Chrome browser window. This will activate the copy checker.\n3. Highlight the text you want to check \n4. Right-click on the highlighted text and select ‘Copy Check Selection’ from the menu\n5. Use the suggestions on the left-hand side of the Copy Checker to make adjustments to your copy.\n\nIf you’d like to get feedback on the copy that you’re yet to publish, please use the browser version of this tool via https://fundraisingcopy.net/.\n\nWe’ll continue to develop this extension, making it easier and better for your to use. If, however, you have feedback on the copy checker or how it can be improved, please email hello@hubbub.net to get in touch with our team."
