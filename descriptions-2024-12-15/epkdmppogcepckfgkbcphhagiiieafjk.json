Check the permissions when you install the extension, you never grant any permissions like that. In fact, there are no external calls at all.\n\nDoes this cost any money to use? \nNope, ShopSuey is completely free to download and use.\n\nHow do you make money then? \nWhen you install this extension, we append our affiliate code to the products displayed on the page. This does not impact your shopping experience. If you complete a purchase, we get a small fraction of the total sale on some products. There is no cost to you and all of this happens behind-the-scenes. You can also disable this feature from the menu if you’d like.\n\nIsn’t this just a glorified userscript? \nYes, it is.\n\nIs the code open source? \nNot really. When you download the extension, you get minified version of the full codebase. But it’s not a public repo on Github or elsewhere and lacks documentation. I may get to this in the near future if people are interested."
