The extension contains an animation of the Solar System that shows how each planet orbits the Sun, how far away it is from the Sun, and how fast it is moving. The user can customize the animation to show whatever they want to see. Solar System Extension is an excellent tool for anyone who wants to learn more about the Solar System or just have some fun.\n\nWhen installing our product, by selecting “Add to Chrome”, I accept and agree to install the Solar System Extension and set Chrome New Tab to the service’s default, as well as the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

Choose your favorite point of view and enjoy.\n\nFor those who want to see it better, we created a small feature that zooms the system and helps you get a better view of planets.\n\nDo not forget to surf the internet using our Search Box. It is situated in the middle of the screen so you do not miss it. We will create amazing bookmarks for the pages you visited most so you do not have to type them every time.\n\nIf you still want to learn more about us and our extension, visit our website:\nSolar System homepage: https://solar-system.io/index.html\n\nCheck out our privacy policy:\nPP: https://solar-system.io/privacy-policy.html\n\nCheck who we are and what is our mission here:\nAbout us: https://solar-system.io/about.html"
