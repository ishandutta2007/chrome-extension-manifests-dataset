This add-on is released under GPL-3.0 license. Works on page load\n\nYou can choose which characters will be removed from the beginning of the lines of code blocks by selecting them from the pop-up menu (click on the add-on icon in the extensions menu to the left of the main menu). After that, you need to reload the github page.\n\nI decided to create this extension when I started seeing similar blocks of code often:\n$ cd dir && cmake && make\n# [some console command]\n> [some console command]\n\nNow, after creating this extension, I can no longer worry about deleting every character. '$','#','>' from my terminal! The previous code will be copied without prompts:\ncd dir && cmake && make\n[some console command]\n[some console command]"
