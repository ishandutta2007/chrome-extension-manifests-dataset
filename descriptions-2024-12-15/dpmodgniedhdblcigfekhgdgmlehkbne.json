As the source code of this project has been published, a lot of so-called developers stole it and made their own. They all work the same, and please check the published date of my code vs the time a new extension is published. I've been receiving a lot of fake emails and comments accusing me of everything they can think of. I do not care.\n\nA fast way to check for Groceries delivery on Amazon Whole food, Amazon Fresh, Costco (which also use Instacart). \n\nInstruction:\nSimply add all the items you want into your cart then go to the checkout page where the delivery availability is shown. The extension will take care of the rest.\n\n- You can leave that tab open and work on other tabs, or just do something else.\n- The basket icon on toolbar will turn green, indicating that the extension is enabled on that page.\n- When a delivery window becomes available you will hear a rooster sound and a notification.\n- It's when you need to come back and check the option, and click order. (Note: the tool will not order for you)\n\nThis is an open-source project, more information can be found at, feedback and help are welcome: \nhttps://github.com/nguyenph88/Groceries-Delivery-Checker"
