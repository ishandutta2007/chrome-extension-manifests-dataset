The appearance of trademarks and/or team logos belonging to Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. or the respective team on this website does not constitute affiliation or endorsement by Major League Baseball or respective team of any of the services provided by this application.\n\nChange History:\n1.3 - Fixed bug where the \"Teams\" list could show just the first 2 teams repeatedly on initial startup\n1.4 - Fixed time zone issue, changed icon left-click from Scoreboard to the current game's Box Score\n1.5 - Fix issue with hovertext when a team has >10 runs\n1.6 - Handle games that are Postponed\n1.7 - Handle games that are Delayed Start\n1.8 - Fixed issue where Delayed Start game wouldn't get updates right away after starting\n2.0 - Updated to use MLB's new API, and updated the in-game icon so that you can see the score as well as what bases have runners on them, how many outs, top/bottom and inning number.  Also includes additional info in hover-text like number of balls, strikes, outs, and current batter.  Revert to the old, simpler in-game icon by ticking the \"Enable Simplified In-Game View\" option in the right-click menu.\n2.1 - Fixed an issue with a previously unseen game state that caused game status to no longer update.  Implemented a workaround that should prevent this from causing breaking changes in the future.\n2.2 - Fixed a bug occurring on days with no games, and added handling for new game status.\n2.3 - Fixed a (timezone conversion) bug causing night games to not register as a game today.\n2.4 - Updated game postponement info in hover text\n2.5 - Fixed a bug in the hovertext where the incorrect team would be named with players on base\n2.6 - Added a third view option for non-fans to only see if there's a home game today or not without any game details, and restructured the menu a bit to accommodate it\n2.7 - Added Arizona timezone\n3.0 - Updated to Extension Manifest v3, logic updates to handle changes in MLB API that broke in-game hovertext, added partial/hack support for Vivaldi browser (which only shows one sub-menu, so Team is now first, still no way to change timezone or mode), updated Indians team name to Guardians.  This release required a TON of changes; please let me know what issues you find.\n3.1 - Fixed logo image quality issue"
