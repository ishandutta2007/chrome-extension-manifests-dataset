(install and take our test to see your time) \n\nResearch shows that after pausing just 50ms over a link, there is a one-in-two chance that you will click it. Smart Links GPT uses an AI prediction algorithm to start loading the page at the earliest moment – giving you a huge head start. So before you can click, the page is already loaded and appears almost instantly.\n\nWorks on ALL websites\n\nSmart Links GPT is still in BETA so if you experience any bugs, just email us and we'll try our best to help you resolve the issue!\n\n--- Releases ---\nV0.92 - First public release\nV0.96 - New GPT AI prediction algorithm"
