Simply go to a group where your ideal clients are hanging out in, and FRIEND MACHINE will send a friend request to specified members. Then when they accept your request, you can also choose to have FRIEND MACHINE send a customized message from you. You can set the message to say hello and start the conversation, or you can invite your new friends to your group, page or send them to your website.\n\nYou can customize the type of people you want to send requests to as well, so you are always getting the RIGHT people on your friends list. You can set it up to send only to people you have mutual friends with too.\n\nYou can set FRIEND MACHINE to customize different combinations of messages, so you never send the same message twice.\n\nYou can also randomize the time between requests so that it sends requests just like a real person would."
