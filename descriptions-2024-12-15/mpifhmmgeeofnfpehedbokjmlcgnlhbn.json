Mit Eye-Able® kannst Du  jede Website an deine jeweiligen individuellen Bedürfnisse anpassen. Sehschwächen, einschließlich Farbschwächen sowie weitere visuelle Einschränkungen können durch eine Individualisierung der Inhaltselemente ganz nach Wunsch ausgeglichen werden. Dafür haben wir unter anderem einen Kontrastmodus, intelligente Schriftvergrößerung und einen Screen-Reader entwickelt.\n\n★ 𝗪𝗶𝗰𝗵𝘁𝗶𝗴𝗲 𝗞𝗲𝗿𝗻-𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗸𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻:\n✔ Schriftvergrößerung\nAnders als mit dem normalen Browser-Zoom, bietet Dir der intelligente Eye-Able®-Zoom die Möglichkeit, eine Website im gleichen Design, nur mit größerer Schrift zu genießen. Im Klartext: Unser Zoom erkennt, welche Inhalte wie stark vergrößert werden sollten. So bleibt das ursprüngliche Layout der Seite bestehen und du kannst die Inhalte dennoch gut lesen.\n\n✔ Kontrastmodus\nDurch eine Vielzahl an Interviews konnten verschiedene Kontrastkombinationen ausgemacht werden, welche eine möglichst barrierefreie Ansicht erreichen. Diese Kombinationen stellen wir unseren User*innen als Möglichkeiten für Hintergrund- und Schriftfarbe zu Verfügung. So kannst Du Vorder- und Hintergrund jeder Website individuell einstellen, genauso, wie du es gerade brauchst.\n\n✔ Intuitiver Screen-Reader (Tonausgabe)\nMit unserer intuitiven Vorlese-Funktion bist du in der Lage, Textinhalte einfach vorlesen zu lassen. Du kannst selbst bestimmen, welche Inhalte Dir vorgelesen werden sollen oder einfach die ganze Seite auf einmal anhören. \n\n✔ Navigation via Tastatur\nIn Verbindung mit unserer freundlichen Tonausgabe bist Du in der Lage, das Internet ohne Maus oder Bildschirm zu bedienen.
