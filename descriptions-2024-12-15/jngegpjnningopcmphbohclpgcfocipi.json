It's 2018, and the internet is a very different place than it was ten—or even five!—years ago. The evolution of the internet means sites need to evolve with it or get left in the dust.\n\nUnfortunately (but understandably), a lot of the tools we love to use for our journaling sites have long since been abandoned, so I decided to create an extension with the hopes of breathing new life into Insanejournal, both in appearance and function.\n\nWhether you're a roleplayer, a personal blogger, or you post fanfiction or resources, Sanity's here to help make your experience better. Sanity doesn't focus on one type of site user so much as all of us! While the majority of us are here to roleplay and/or create related resources for the hobby, all the tools I've integrated into the Sanity extension are here to fit any need!"
