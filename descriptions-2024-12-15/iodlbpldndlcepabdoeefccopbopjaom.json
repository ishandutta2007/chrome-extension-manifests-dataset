Just open all Facebook groups in separate tabs, enter your keywords, press start, and enjoy the magic! :)\n\nHow it works:\nThe extension will notify you with text snippets from the groups and automatically scroll to the relevant post. All tabs are numbered, so it's easy to find the relevant group.\nFacebook Groups are automatically scanned every 10 minutes, so you won't miss anything relevant from now on. Just make sure you don't loose your internet connection, and if so, just refresh all tabs and load the Facebook Groups again, to allow this extension to scan them for your keywords and patterns."
