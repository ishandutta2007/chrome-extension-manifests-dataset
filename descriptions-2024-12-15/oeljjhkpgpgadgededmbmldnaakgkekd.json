What does Yelp Sort even mean? Why is a review from 1 year ago the first thing I see?\n\nThis extension defaults Yelp review sorting to \"Newest First,\" so you can get the most up-to-date reviews upfront. It's what every sensible person wants.\n\nThis extension is very, very simple. When we detect that you are on a Yelp page, we set the sort to Newest First in case it is not already set. Under the hood, this is done by adding the sort_by query param.\n\nCode for this extension is open source: https://github.com/sharmilajesupaul/yelp-sort-extension"
