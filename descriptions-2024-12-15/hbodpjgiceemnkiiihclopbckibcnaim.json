We wanted to make it easy for them to get fonts and colors from a website without having to tediously inspect each element to get them. It's meant to generate inspiration and ideas based on other website's styles. \n\nOf course, it's not just for designers. Anyone that is curious or has a use for it is welcome to use it.\n\n\nVersion 2.0.1\n   Minor bug fixes\n\nVersion 2.0\nAble to choose the amount of fonts and colors you want displayed.\n\nYou can change a color elimination strength bar to eliminate similar colors. The higher the bar the colors displayed will be less and less similar to each other.\n\nChanged main description\n\nNotes:\nThere is going to be a lag time between the site update and the extension update because Chrome rolls out updates every few ours and if the site is updated before the extension the extension will not work.\n\n\nVersion 1.1\n    Name and description update\n\nVersion 1.0\n   Launched"
