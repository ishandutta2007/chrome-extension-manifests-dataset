Developed initially for an internal project, it's now available for all, ensuring no data collection from users.\n\n\nIdeal for Industry Professionals\nPerfect for toolmakers, machine operators, plastic molding factories, and anyone in production planning. Whether you're operating in a mould shop, running series on lathes, or milling machines, this tool caters to your needs.\n\n\nSimple Input, Clear Output\nInput the number of parts per cycle, cycle time in seconds, and total production quantity. Adjust for machine efficiency to reflect operational hours accurately. The calculator adds calculated production time to the current time, offering a precise completion estimate.\n\n\nUnique History Function\nCompare different production scenarios efficiently. For example, if you're adapting from 16 to 12 cavities due to a mold issue, quickly evaluate the impact on your production timeline.\n\n\nQuick and Accessible Solution\nProduction Time Calculator is designed to be straightforward and efficient, providing rapid results when you need them most. Easily accessible directly in your browser, which is often already open and at your fingertips, it allows for quick calculations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you're unexpectedly asked for production times, like during a phone call. \n\nJust a few clicks, and you have your answer, facilitating more informed and swift responses in your day-to-day production discussions.\n\n\n----------------------------\n\n\nThis Chrome extension was created for internal tasks as part of my development journey to learn programming. If you have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to share them with me.\n\nNormally, I create websites and focus on SEO, and I've taken a more programmatic approach to my SEO work. That's why I have several small projects like this one, to learn coding.\n\nMy approach to SEO is holistic, so I work on speed optimization, security optimization, user intent, and conversion optimization. Everything needs to come together seamlessly, and in my view, the most important metric is client ROI.\n\nYou can find more about me and my business here:  \nhttps://mindthetrap.dk"
