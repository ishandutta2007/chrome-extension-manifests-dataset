It is hard to find peace and balance in all of the noise. \n\nHave you ever felt like you were lost at sea, helplessly cast about amongst the endless waves of emotions like anxiety, frustration, despair, anger, or negativity? \n\nThis App will help you calm the stormy waters and reestablish a sense of control and peace.   CalmWave uses the methods of cognitive behavior therapy to train your brain to be less anxious and to promote self-esteem and happiness.\n\nHow it Works\nAt the heart of this App is what is known as the ABCD method. Using this method, you will progress through a series of 4 steps.  As you complete these steps, you will learn to identify the belief patterns that are behind your negative emotional state. You will begin to understand why you think and feel the way that you do, so that you can make positive changes in your life.\n\nPRIVACY & USE-OF-DATA DISCLOSURE:\nCalm wave does not store, collect, share, sell or otherwise transmit and personal information for its own purpose or that of any third party.\n\nFor app development purposes and better metrics of user interaction with Calm Wave, the extension utilizes the Google Analytics API.\n\nFor its functionality, the app does temporarily store data locally (on the user's computer) during use in the authenticated user's own Chrome browser's storage segment until the user clears the data either by pressing \"Wash Your Worries Away\" button or the 'x' icon on the top corner of the popup window.\n\n***Disclaimer: this app is not intended to replace treatment by a qualified mental health practitioner should you need professional help. If you are feeling depressed or having thoughts of suicide, you should see a doctor right away.***"
