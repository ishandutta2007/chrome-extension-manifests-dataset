The different internet and desktop applications you used are tracked and divided into categories, which let you evaluate productivity while at the computer for yourself.\n\nTo accurately track the different websites you use and to divide them into productive, unproductive and neutral, this extension must be installed. The extension allows DeskTime to view and classify each separate website, rather than simply seeing Chrome as a whole. The extension accompanies the DeskTime app, and does not function on its own. You can get the app at http://desktime.com"
