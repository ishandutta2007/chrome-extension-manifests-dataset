Suki listens to patient-clinician conversations and automatically generates suggestions for notes.  Easily accept, reject, or edit suggestions before they are sent to the EHR.\nDictation.  Dictate additional details or make changes to note content.  \nCommands.  Use voice commands to add scripts (macros) and make edits.\n\nSuki’s Chrome Extension can be integrated with MEDITECH (integration with additional EHRs coming soon).  It can also be used as a standalone solution.  When Suki is integrated with the EHR, it provides an even more powerful experience.\nPull up-to-date information.  Suki can pull the latest details, like patient vitals, from the EHR and into the note.\nSend notes back to the EHR.  Once notes are done, send them back to the EHR with a click.  \nDictate into any field the EHR.\n\nSuki is HIPAA compliant and SOC2 Type 2 certified.\n\nAn active Suki account is required to use the Suki Chrome Extension.  The Suki Chrome Extension works in Google Chrome as well as Microsoft Edge.  For Edge users, Suki can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store by allowing extensions from other stores in the Edge browser.  To learn more about Suki’s solutions, visit https://www.suki.ai"
