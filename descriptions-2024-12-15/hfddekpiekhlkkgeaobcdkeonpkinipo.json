A separate patch is prepared, to help users connect to the TOR network. To get the patch, please visit this GitHub repo (https://github.com/jeremy-jr-benthum/onion-browser-button/releases) and download (mac.zip) or (win.zip) file depending on your operating system. Then follow the instructions on the repo (https://github.com/jeremy-jr-benthum/onion-browser-button) in order to connect to TOR network.\n\nNote 1: With this extension ONLY added domains will pass through TOR network and all other domains/websites will remain intact from TOR proxy.\n\nNote 2: Before using the add-on you need to add desired domains which you want to pass through TOR proxy. To do so, please open toolbar popup and add desired domains comma separated in the designated area. For example, if you want to browse - torproject.org - with tor network, please add - *.torproject.org* - in the input area (note to add * at the beginning and end). All changes are auto-saved to the memory. Also please note that, items need to be comma separated and without space in the popup (*.torproject.org*,*.example.com*,...). As mentioned above, ONLY these domains will pass through the TOR network and all other websites will remain intact from TOR proxy.\n\nIf you have a feature request, or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon's homepage (http://mybrowseraddon.com/browse-in-tor.html)"
