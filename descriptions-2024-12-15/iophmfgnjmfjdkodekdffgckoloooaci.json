If it cant find a good match among the domains on the local list, then it will just send the user to google.\n\nThe extension is extremely privacy friendly and doesnt send anything, it only fetches the full list of all domains from our server and then searches over the list locally, never sending any search to our server. Furthermore, the extension only requires the permission to replace the new tab page, i didnt add any other permissions in order to keep attack surface as small as possible."
