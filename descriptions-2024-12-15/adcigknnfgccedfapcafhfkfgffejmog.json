You can also adjust the brightness and contrast to suit your needs better. \n\nNIGHT SHIFT\nNot all dark themes have a night shift feature, but our extension does. When on, it will invert the blue light that comes from the computer screen to warm. That way, preventing eye strain when working hours in a row. \n\nYou can turn this setting on or off in just one click when needed."
