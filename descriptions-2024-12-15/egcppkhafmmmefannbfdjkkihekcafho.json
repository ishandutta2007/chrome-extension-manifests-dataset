First click on the extension and activate screen sharing, then copy and send out the link at which participants can view your stream. \n\nParticipants will be able to use any web browser to join your screen sharing session. They will not have to install any additional software. Communikate Screen Sharing is also lightweight on network connectivity, since compressed jpeg images are sent out to participants only when your screen changes. Your mouse movements are sent as coordinates separate from the screen captured jpeg and will show up on the participants screen as a red laser pointer. Feel free to use your mouse to direct the presentation."
