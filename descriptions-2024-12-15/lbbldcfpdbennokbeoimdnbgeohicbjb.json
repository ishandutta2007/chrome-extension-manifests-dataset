In the background of the festivities, you can find all sorts of flowers used as decorations in honor of Tết. Common flowers include the apricot cherry blossoms and orchids. In this piece, the flowers stemming from the same branch symbolize how we all gather to celebrate and connect more deeply as a result. \n\nKhôi Phạm is a Saigon-born, Brooklyn-based Vietnamese artist. His works investigate and distort the quiet vibration within the mundane. Drawing inspiration from everyday objects, Khôi amplifies these items, expanding their meaning and presence past the obvious."
