The game tests your vocabulary and quick-thinking skills under a time constraint.\n\nHow to Play:\n\n1) Starting the Game: When you launch the game, you'll see a randomized set of letters on the screen. These letters are a scrambled version of a non-anagrammatic word (a word that can't form another valid word when its letters are rearranged) that's 5 letters long.\n\n2) Making a Guess: Look at the scrambled letters and try to form a valid word. Type your guess into the provided input box.\n\n3) Submitting Your Answer: Type your guess and click \"Submit\" to verify it. Correct answers increase your score by 5 points, while incorrect guesses don't affect the score.\"\n\n4) Keeping an Eye on the Timer: The game begins with a 100-second timer, displayed at the top right corner of the game screen. This timer counts down, and you must try to score as many points as possible before it reaches 0.\n\n5) Game Over: When the timer hits 0, the game is over. An overlay will appear with a \"Restart\" button. Click the button to begin a new game. The timer will reset to 100 seconds, and your score will reset to 0.\n\nOther Functions:\n\n1) Using the \"Next\" Button: If you're stumped and can't figure out the word, click the \"Next\" button. This will present a new set of scrambled letters from the pre-prepared word list for you to solve.\n\n2) Viewing the Answer: If you're curious about the correct word for a particularly challenging scramble, click the \"View\" button. The answer will be displayed at the top of the screen.\n\nTips for Success:\n\n- Take quick glances at the letters and trust your first instinct. Often, the correct word might just pop into your mind.\n- If a word doesn't immediately come to mind, shuffle the letters in your head or on a piece of paper.\n- Practice makes perfect. The more you play, the better you'll get at spotting words quickly.\n\nHave fun playing the word game!
