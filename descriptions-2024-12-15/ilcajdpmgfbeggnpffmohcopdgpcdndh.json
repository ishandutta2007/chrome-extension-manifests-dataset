This will only work if you have the Focusmate Dashboard (calendar) or the session window page open (It's fine if you are browsing other pages as long as it is open).\n\nAlarms before the end of the session:\nSet an alarm or multiple alarms to go off before the end of Focusmate sessions. This is a good way to to remind yourself the session is ending soon and give yourself an extra motivational boost to get as much done as possible until the end of the session. You can also use the time to get organized for the end of the session check-in with your partner.  You can choose for it to go off 10 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute or 20 seconds before the end of the session as well as any combination of these ringing times. \nThere are three sounds to choose from: a Bell, Bleat, and Chirp. Test them out!\n\nIt is not advisable to use this extension during mic-on sessions as the sounds can distract your focusmate\n\nIf the extension is not working properly or you have questions or suggestions please contact me at yaeluria@gmail.com."
