It achieves this by uniquely \"scrambling\" your password for every site you visit.\n\nPassword Scrambler helps you address problems related to using the same password in multiple sites, a practice that results in security vulnerabilities.\n\nPassword Scrambler is available for all major browsers: Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox.\n\nThink about the following questions:\n\nDo you use the same password everywhere?\nHow many password-protected sites do you go to?\nCan you remember all the passwords you use, or do you end up using the same password everywhere?\nWhat if one of these sites was compromised, and your password was stolen?\nDo you use multiple passwords and keep forgetting which one to use where?\nHave you ever frantically tried every password you know in the hope that's the right one? What if the site is recording all those attempts, and thus learning all your passwords?"
