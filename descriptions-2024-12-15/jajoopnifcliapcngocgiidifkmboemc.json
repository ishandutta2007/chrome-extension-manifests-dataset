This will access the built in tracing functionality that comes as part of PeopleSoft applications and will turn this on or off when the button is clicked.\n\nCTRL + J Information\n• Get the most important CTRL + J information by clicking an icon in the toolbar.  If the PeopleSoft environment you are logged into has CTRL+J enabled, then the information you can see by clicking CTRL+J can now be access by a clicking a button in the PS Utilities toolbar - it will retrieve the most relevant information from the web page and display it on the screen.\n\nField Inspector\n• Use the field inspector to find the name of records and fields behind the pages, it does this by looking at the HTML behind the PeopleSoft page and identifies the HTML tags around the fields and displays this in the PS Utilities toolbar.\n\nSearch Page Features\n• Auto Correct History – the Correct History option will be selected on search pages by default.\n• Auto Advanced Search – some search pages have Basic Search by default, which means you have to click the Advanced Search button to be able to search by more parameters, this option will always bring up the Advanced Search options.\n\nNew Window\n• Click to open another PeopleSoft window in your browser.\n\nComponent pages\n• Some components have so many pages that you can’t see them all without scrolling through by clicking the arrow icons.\n• Page Tabs provides quick links to all the pages in a component from the toolbar.\n\nEnvironment Indicator and User ID\n• The name of the environment you are logged into as well as the User ID with which you are logged in will be displayed in the toolbar.\n• Very useful for people who work in multiple environments or log in with multiple user accounts.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n• URLs of any PeopleSoft sites you access will be stored in your local storage.\n\nAll of the information that PS Utilities displays (such as User ID) comes from the HTML of the page you are viewing, just the name and URLs of your various PeopleSoft environments are stored in local storage as described above."
