They are becoming more illustrative, more informative and more aesthetically pleasing. Obviously, more complex process requires more of one's time and efforts\n\nWith Marker, you can type in simple plain text mails in the Markdown format with the client in your browser and with just a simple click of a button, you magically transform your childish email into a neat, well-formatted and beautiful organisation of content."
