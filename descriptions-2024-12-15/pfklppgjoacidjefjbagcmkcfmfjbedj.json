First Day is a New-Tab Chrome Extension that encourages you to live a more meaningful life day by day: Every day, you'll be reminded that this is the first day of the rest of your life. You'll see how much time has already passed and how much time you may have left. Every morning, you are asked to write down how you want to make your day count. Each new tab you open will remind you of your mortality and intention for the day.\n\nEach circle represents one week of your life. The age of your death is calculated by the country you are located in. This can be changed in the settings. There, you can also change colors and layout as well as other display settings. In addition, a bucket list will help you keep track of the things you want to do before you die. You’ll also find inspiration from successful people in some of the circles. \n\nLive greatly."
