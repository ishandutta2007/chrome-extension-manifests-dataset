OX does exactly that.  Your read-later-bookmarks will be transformed into an up-to-date digest of interesting websites, easily accessible and manageable from any new tab.\n\nNo user account required.\nSimply syncs with your bookmarks.\nEasy archiving of bookmarks that you have read.\nA new color theme every day."
