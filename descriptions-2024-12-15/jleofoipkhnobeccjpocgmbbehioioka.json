This forces everyone to spend more time on a screen than normal. Over the last few weeks of school, me and my friends noticed that our eyes hurt during zoom calls. Because of this, I have created a chrome extension for not just me, but for all students to use as a reminder to look away from their screen for few seconds to reduce eye strain."
