Once installed, you can use the tool and our process to tag new group members in dedicated post(s) via the comment section with a pre-written designated comment. \n\nThis extension was designed to eliminate the mundane task of welcoming (and directing) new group members to a certain group post to get started on. This tool works especially well if you have a group growing very quickly where you plan to monetize and market to it.\n\nThis extension was built by marketers for marketers! Welcome new people into your group to get started quickly and move through your content in an effective & directed manner!\n\nHere are the top three reasons you need this extension...\n\n#1 - Be Personable... Not Tacky!\n\nUse this tool to personally welcome new group members in a dedicated post via the comment section. Just tagging people by their names without a personal message is tacky! The extension can rotate through 3 different pre-written comments + tag the new group member in each comment (see screenshots and video on this page).\n\nExample: You have 9 new group members. The extension will post to the comments section in a dedicated post that you choose, posting a comment + tag for each person, resulting in 9 separate comments.\n\n#2 - Filter Out \"Bad Apples\" & Spammers! Keep Group Integrity Held High!\n\nThis extension was designed to be more than just a tool! It was designed to be a filtering process to keep the \"bad apples\" and spammers out of your group. Once you install our extension and go through our process, you'll learn how to effectively grow your group with the perfect \"avatar\", ideal customer base, and potential clients.\n\nExample: You have 9 people request to join your group. Using our filtering process, you will only be allowing people into your group that meet specific criteria. Let's say out of those 9, only 6 people meet that criteria. Once the criteria is met, our extension will then tag them via the comments section in your dedicated post. Keep the integrity of your group held high!\n\n#3 - Save Time! Stay Focused On MPA's!\n\nUse this tool to save loads of time! If you have 10, 50, 100, 500+ people joining your group every day, it will be very hard and time-consuming to manually comment and tag people in a dedicated post. Save you and your admins time to focus on the more important things like content creation, customer service within your group, outreach, and MPA's!\n\nExample: You have 50 people joining your group every day. Use our tool either throughout the day or at one time to welcome those 50 new members via a comment + tag in a dedicated post (see screenshots and video on this page).\n\nFeatures & notes:\n\n- This extension is a tool + process that comes with installation directions and training! \n\n- There are different versions of this extension that have different feature sets depending on what version you purchase.\n\n- This extension works alongside google sheets to properly post to groups. So you will need to use google sheets with this extension. Don't worry, it's easy to do! Training is provided!\n\nUpdates to this extension are made frequently & as quickly as possible! \n\n*this extension is not affiliated with Facebook™"
