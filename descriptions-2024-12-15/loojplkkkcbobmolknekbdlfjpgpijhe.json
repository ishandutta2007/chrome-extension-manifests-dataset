By leveraging open-source intelligence tools, SUS performs API calls to gather community ratings, IOC's, and threat vectors, providing users with a comprehensive overview of potential security risks.\n\nThis is performed via the shortcut key while highlighting a string. The extension will automatically identify the string format and call the correlated API. File types are identified via MD5 SHA-256 and SHA-1 hash types. URL identification is constrained by the domain and will not include specified pages. \n\nUpon searching, the extension automatically stores the API call response within the user's clipboard for easy and quick access, allowing security analysts to make informed decisions based on the most up-to-date information. With SUS, users can streamline their workflow and stay ahead of potential security threats."
