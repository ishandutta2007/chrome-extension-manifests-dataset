Clicking the \"Prime\" logo Enables or Disables the feature ( indicated by a small radio button ).\n\nThis is a very small extension that has virtually NO impact on browsing speed.\n\nSupported Amazon sites:\nAmazon.co.uk\n\nI will create another extension that works on other Amazon sites.\n\nPermissions required by this extension:\nRead and change your data on Amazon.co.uk\n\nHow it works:\nHow this extension works is easy, it looks to see if you are on any of the Amazon sites listed above, if you are it adds the \"Prime\" button in the search bar of Amazon. If not it does nothing. It enables \"Prime Results\" by appending the search URL with \"rh=i:aps,p_76:419158031\".\n\nNOTE:\nThis extension also adds my Affiliate ID into search results. This means that I get a small percentage of purchases you make from Amazon ( costs you no more ). Hope this is OK.\n\nVersion History:\n1.0 - Initial release.\n1.1 - Logo changes and code edits.\n1.2 - Further code and image optimization. Updated description with more details. Also added screenshot and video.\n1.3 - Updated extension to support Amazon's new site layout and Prime search options. Also made it specific to Amazon.co.uk site ( sue to the different layouts used by Amazon across its sites now ).\nUpdated screenshot to reflect new Amazon.co.uk look.\nI will create separate extensions for other countries soon."
