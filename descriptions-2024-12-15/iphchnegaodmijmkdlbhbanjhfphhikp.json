This works because all URLs have a \".\" in them.\n\n✓ Batch-remove tabs by extracting tabs to a new window using Tab Extract, and then closing the window.\n\n✓ Tab Extract can merge tabs from across different windows into the same window by using a common keyword amongst the tabs.\n\nNotes: There is no need to select anything in the auto complete box, just press enter. \n\nIf your Chrome has saved some \"ex <keyword>\" as a search term for autocomplete, clear your history.\n\nFirefox version: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-extract-port/\n\n==============================\ntab management, tabs, Find tabs, TabKit, FoxTab, TabMixPlus, TreeStyleTabs, Too Many Tabs, Tab Menu, tab move, tab organize, duplicate, batch remove, tab split, window split"
