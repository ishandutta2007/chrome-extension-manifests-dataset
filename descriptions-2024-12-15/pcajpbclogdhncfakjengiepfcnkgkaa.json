By clicking on a marker you can also delete the timestamp.\nMarkers will always be placed on the timeline if a video has saved timestamps for it.\nIf a livestream has DVR not enabled the markers are not placed at the right position. Once the VOD is online and the page has been refresh they will be placed on the correct position."
