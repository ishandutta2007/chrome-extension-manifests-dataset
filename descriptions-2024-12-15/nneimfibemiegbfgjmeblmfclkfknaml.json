I started developing this app for the final project of Programming A2Z 2015 at ITP NYU. I have been still developing this for both study and usage purpose for myself so any user feedbacks would be very welcome and much grateful for me. \n\nCurrently, I have been researching on sharing data between different devices since this app uses chrome.storage.local which only stores data on the user's local machine. I decided not to use chrome.storage.sync because it does not allow the users to access storage more than over certain times per a minute, which does not fit on the purpose of this app. And also I decided not to use HTML5 Local Storage due to the insecurity of when the users delete caches of chrome browser that will delete database too. Please hit me up if you have any idea of this, I would appreciate. \n\nav.seoul@gmail.com\n\nThanks,\nav"
