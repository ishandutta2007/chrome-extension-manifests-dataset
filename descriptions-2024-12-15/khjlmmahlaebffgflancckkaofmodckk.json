This can help remember folks you've interacted with, or folks who've inspired you in the past with their comments, and can give some very personal context to some comments.\n\nThis is something I wanted for myself multiple times when reading HN, so I sat down and built it. Its very simple, bare-bones, and non-fancy, and I intend to keep it that way.\n\nSource code available at https://github.com/sharat87/hn-user-notes."
