The goal of this extension to increase corporate transparency for internet users.\n\n===\n\n\"Native advertising\" is a method of advertising that presents ads as journalism or unbiased articles.\n\nThis technique is used by publications like the New York Times, The Atlantic, Gawker, Buzzfeed, and others. Stories may be marked as sponsored, but disclaimers are subtle because the whole point is that users don't know it's an ad.\n\n===\n\nThis extension requires permission to run on pages you visit, but your data is never used, stored, or transmitted.  For those who wish to contribute or audit, AdDetector is open source: http://github.com/typpo/ad-detector"
