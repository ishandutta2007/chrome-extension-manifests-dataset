The Department of Health (and thus the media) tend to blame this on hospitals and staff, as if it were their fault. In reality there simply isn’t enough money provided by the Treasury to provide the services that are needed, with staff overstretched, waiting lists increasing and patient care suffering in quality. England spends less (% GDP) on the NHS than the OECD average.\n\nThis extension automatically changes words and phrases on websites describing the funding crisis to reflect the truth: that the health service we love is not being funded properly from the top.\n\nDeveloped by:\nHugh Harvey, @DrHughHarvey\nMatt Morris, @boxel\n————\n\nFeatures:\n\nEasy install (and removal)\nWorks on all websites\nChanges text only\nOnly functions in relevant context (e.g site mentions NHS)\nNever read about overspending again!\n\n————\n\nDisclaimer: \nThis extension changes the way the text of news websites is presented.
