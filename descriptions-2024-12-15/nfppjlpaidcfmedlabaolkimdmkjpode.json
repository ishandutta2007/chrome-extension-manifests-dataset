It's dangerously easy to scroll mindlessly for hours, especially when it comes to social media.\n \nSo what if we playfully visualised infinite scrolling as a deep sea dive, to help people experience their scrolling habit more tangibly?\n \nAnchor is a simple Chrome extension which plays on this feeling of sinking. The further down you scroll, the deeper you dive — and you can watch as your screen slowly turns a dark blue, a little fish swims across your screen, and finally, you hit a (literal) rock bottom.\n \nWe're thinking this could be easily adapted and expanded (by you!) into a whole series of scrolling experiments. Think cave exploring, parachuting, digging to the center of the Earth... All our code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/benjchan/Anchor) for you to play with and evolve.\n\nProject created by:\n- Brendan Browne-Adams (https://www.brendanbrownedesigns.com/)\n- Lahari Goswami (https://laharigoswami.cargo.site)\n- Miki Chiu (https://www.mikichiu.com)\n- Tayo Kopfer (https://tayo.co.za)\n- Twomuch Studio (https://twomuch.studio)\n\nFor a more up-to-date version, check out https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anchor/edefjkgbhajbmjkkclpacaelombcdiik. This is provided for those who prefer the simplicity of the original extension."
