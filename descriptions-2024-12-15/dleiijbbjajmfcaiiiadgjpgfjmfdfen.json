For example, to open a link numbered 13 in a new window, you could manually hit control shift space then type \"13:w\" into the resulting pop-up then hit enter.  In practice, a voice command like \"window pick 1 3\" would be used to type these keys.  \n\nWARNING: this extension by itself provides no voice functionality; procurement of the needed voice commands is the user's responsibility. One recommended means of doing this is to use Vocola (http://vocola.net/). \n\nSupported functionality includes focusing input elements, clicking elements, opening links in the same tab/a new (focused) tab/a new window, and removing the keyboard focus from the current element.  For how to use Click by Voice, see https://github.com/mdbridge/click-by-voice/blob/master/README.md.  CbV provides functionality similar to that of Firefox's mouseless browsing extension for voice control."
