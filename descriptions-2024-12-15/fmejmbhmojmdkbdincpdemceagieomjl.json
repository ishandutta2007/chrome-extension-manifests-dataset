It's like a Trapper/Keeper for books. You can also click out to the book's Bookshop.org or Amazon page. \n\nImagine: you're reading this great article mentioning all kinds of interesting books. You'd love to just \"bookmark\" those books so you can go back to them later. Or maybe the site forgot to link out to Amazon. This extension is the answer.\n\nThis extension is a companion for the TBR Booklist Tracker app. Books you save here are also tracked in the app, and vice versa. But you do not need the app to use this extension. \n\nBookmarker \"reads\" the text of the web page you are on, figures out which books are mentioned, and gives you a beautiful little window with all the cover art for the books shown. You can \"bookmark\" those books, and they'll go in your trapper/keeper of books. You can come back to them any time. \n\nCome back to Bookmarker any time, hit the \"gear\" button, and hit \"TBR list\" and you'll see the books you've been saving away. Your To Be Read list.\n\nDon't forget to check out Bookship, our social reading app!"
