Results open in a new background tab.  (Can change settings to open in foreground.)\n\nThis is an unofficial extension; I am not related to IQDB.\n\n***\nVersion History (changelog):\n\n2.0:\n- Updated to extension manifest v3.  Minimum Chrome version increased to 88.  If you need the previous version of the extension (0.6.1), it can be downloaded here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1A_LMEQG3obQSDRhAHn2ze5PjV7rkxi82/view?usp=sharing\n- Settings code revised for manifest v3 compatibility.  You may need to reapply your settings.\n- Added option to always spawn the Results tab next to the current tab (enabled by default).\n- Closing the Results tab now returns to the tab you searched from.\n\n0.6.1:\n- Changed tab-creation setting to use \"active\" instead of \"selected\", since the latter was deprecated after Chrome 33.\n\n0.6:\n- Now with HTTPS, thanks to the site admin adding support.  Merry Christmas!\n\n0.5:\n- Changed from background page to event page, so the extension process is only loaded when needed.\n- Minimum Chrome version increased to 22, due to above change.\n- <all_urls> permission removed, since the contextMenu permission made it redundant at some point.\n\n0.4:\n- Updated to extension manifest v2, per Chrome requirements going forward.\n- Minimum Chrome version increased to 18, due to above change.\n- Removed defunct iqdb.hanyuu.net mirror from options.\n\n0.3.1:\n- Added 48x48 and 128x128 icons from the \"Token\" iconset by Evan Brooks (http://brsev.com), used under the Creative Commons attribution-noncommercial-share-alike 3.0 license.\n- Added credits file.\n\n0.3:\n- Filenames with spaces and special characters should now work correctly.\n- Added 48x48 icon.\n\n0.2:\n- Initial release."
