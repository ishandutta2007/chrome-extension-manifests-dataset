UT gives you a schedule that you can view online or download as a pdf. But a schedule in that format is just about as useful as a knife with no blade. So every time I get a new schedule, I spend 15 minutes adding each class, one-by-one, as an event to my calendar.\n\nThis extension solves that problem! All you have to do is:\n1. Install the extension.\n2. Go to https://my.utk.edu and choose the schedule you'd like to download.\n3. Click the UT Schedule Maker icon that should now appear next to your URL.\n4. Get on with your life.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, see https://github.com/cnorick/UTK-Schedule-Maker"
