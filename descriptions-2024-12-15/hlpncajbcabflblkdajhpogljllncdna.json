We also provide an \"English Learner's Edition\" on our website for people who learn English as a second language to learn correct pronunciation, which uses a slightly different scheme that mimics the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).\n\nFive modes (Full, Less Full, Medium, Lite and Extra Lite) are provided for users of different literacy levels. Modes for advanced learners (Less Full, Medium, Lite and Extra Lite) will show fewer diacritics."
