For each website you choose to monitor, the app will check the status of those websites every 15 minutes. You can view the status in the app itself, and for any websites that are not up (that is, not returning an HTTP 200 OK status), you'll get an email update to inform you of the status for those failing websites.\n\nIf you want to stop monitoring a website, just click the Remove button next to it.\n\nSuper Simple Website Checker was built using Google Apps Script and demonstrates the usage of HtmlService, ScriptDb, triggers, and UrlFetch.
