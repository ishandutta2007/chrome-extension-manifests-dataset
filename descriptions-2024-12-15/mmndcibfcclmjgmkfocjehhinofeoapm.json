This tool is primarily intended to encourage students to complete their tasks independently, using the knowledge and skills they have acquired through our curriculum. Our institute has developed a custom web-based programming platform that students use for both practice and examinations, and this extension is seamlessly integrated with that platform. Since the platform is hosted locally at our institute, the extension will communicate exclusively with our server to maintain privacy and security.\n\nTo make the extension more accessible for students, we plan to publish it on the Chrome Web Store. This will allow students to easily install it with just a few clicks. Additionally, by hosting it on the Chrome Web Store, students will automatically receive updates whenever we enhance the extension or introduce new features, ensuring that they always have the latest version for an improved and secure exam experience. Our goal is to create a fair, controlled, and streamlined online assessment environment, fostering a culture of integrity and self-reliance in line with our institution's educational values."
