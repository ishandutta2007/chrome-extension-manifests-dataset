Three buttons have been added to the page, just above the items section of the character. Clicking the \"add\" button will add that characters uniques and set items to the shop. You can now navigate to a new character and do the same thing.\n\nWhen you're done adding items, you can click the \"Make Shop\" button and a fully formatted forum trade post will appear in your clipboard. Just paste this into your trade forum thread. The only thing left to do is change the name of the title.\n\nUpdate 1.1:\n- Added toggling boxes to choose which item categories you want to add from the given character.\n- Added a runes and a charm category to automatically put into your shop.\n- Redefined the layout of the BBCode (The forum post)\n- Added some checks to avoid certain bugs from happening\n- Added a Popup-window for you to insert your shop name. Please be aware that the shop name will be prefixed with \" Shop\".\n- Added TU, SU, SSU and SSSU grouping to the unique items. This will automatically be done!\n- Redefined how set items are placed in the forum post. The Set Item category is now a full spoiler, and inside it the sets will be grouped by set name."
