Recipients are dynamically colour coded as you add them to your email draft, and you can also configure specific colour mappings to help visually spot particular untrusted domains before you click send.\n\nIf you have signed into Google using your G-Suite account you can also benefit from Check on Send syncing your settings against your profile across multiple devices. Please note that you will need to refresh your browser for any active Gmail tabs to update when first installing or enabling/disabling the extension.\n\nI developed this extension given how easily one can accidentally pull in the wrong recipient with auto-complete, and following feedback from colleagues that something like this would be useful.\n\nFor any comments and feedback please email check.on.send@gmail.com.\n\nPRIVACY NOTICE: \nCheck on Send does not collect any personal information, nor does it read or track any information about the content of your emails. The only tracked information is limited to the trusted domains you specify and the first 50 untrusted email domains as these are automatically assigned unique colour mappings. This information is only stored against your own Google account extension profile using the Google Sync API managed and hosted by Google. Check on Send does not otherwise transmit this information beyond your browser."
