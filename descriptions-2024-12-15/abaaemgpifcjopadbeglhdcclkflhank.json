With 1 click, it can zip the urls and titles of all tabs into one .json file, and locally saved to your Chrome download path. \nYou'll need it when you opened many, many tabs in one window, and not sure if you want to close the window without regrets. Saving all them into Bookmark is too exhausted, and checking the History is also tedious. So why not try this!\nAfter you get the .json file, you can see what you browsed easily. You may assist yourself with Editor like VSCode to format it into a reading-friendly form."
