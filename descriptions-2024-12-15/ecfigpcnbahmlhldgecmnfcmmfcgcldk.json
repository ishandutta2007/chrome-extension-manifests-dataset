After that, the extension will generate 1 resin every 8 minutes like the game does.\n\nUsing this extension you will be able to see how many resin you get without connecting to the game, so, you will be able to use this time to make other useful thing.\nNote that this extension doesn't sync with the game, so, you have to update your resin counter when you consume resin in-game.\n\nYou will never be full of resin again with this extension"
