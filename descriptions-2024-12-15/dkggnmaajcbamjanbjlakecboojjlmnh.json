FLS Transit automates this process, letting you easily copy FLS settings from one Salesforce org to another, saving you time and ensuring accuracy.\n\n\t•\tLocal Storage Only: FLS Transit stores your field’s FLS settings locally in your browser’s storage—no data ever leaves your machine.\n\t•\tSeamless Application: With just a few clicks, the extension checks the appropriate boxes for you, allowing you to review and apply changes quickly.\n\t•\tNo External Libraries: FLS Transit is lightweight and built without any external dependencies, ensuring speed and security.\n\nWhy These Permissions Are Required:\n\nTo ensure seamless operation, FLS Transit requests several permissions, but your privacy and security are my top priorities:\n\n\t•\tStorage: This allows the extension to store FLS data locally on your machine, ensuring that no data leaves your device. It is used solely for storing and applying the FLS for your Salesforce fields.\n\t•\tActiveTab and Scripting: Salesforce renders its pages dynamically, often inside iframes. To work around these complexities, FLS Transit needs to access and interact with these pages, but it only activates when you’re on relevant Salesforce domains (e.g., *.salesforce.com).\n\t•\tWeb Navigation: This permission allows the extension to detect Salesforce-specific pages where the FLS forms are located, ensuring FLS Transit activates exactly where you need it, and nowhere else.\n\nYour data and privacy are safe—these permissions are strictly used for interacting with Salesforce FLS pages and storing settings locally. No personal data is accessed, stored, or transmitted.\n\nFLS Transit is designed to help you work smarter, with respect for your data security and privacy."
