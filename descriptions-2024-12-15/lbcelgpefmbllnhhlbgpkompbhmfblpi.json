Well, then this tool is for you. Forward HTML, CSS and video player changes over to an existing SocketIO server.\n\nThe scenarios for this are multiple but one of them is if you are a streamer, you can create a simple currently playing overlay for YouTube and SoundCloud with minimal hassle.\n\nYou are not even required to write anything yourself since you can import others work with only a few clicks. \n\nThe extension is made with simplicity in mind to make the experience as easy as possible but creating your very own presets/website listeners requires a limited understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
