This commission comes at no additional cost to you.\n\nTransparency: We believe in transparency. Whenever possible, we will clearly mark affiliate links or indicate that a link is an affiliate link. However, due to the nature of Chrome extensions, this might not always be as straightforward as on a traditional website. \nUse at Your Own Risk: While we strive to only affiliate with reputable companies and products, we cannot guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of products or services offered by third parties. Always perform your own due diligence before making any purchase or decision based on an affiliate link.\n\nNo Endorsement: The presence of an affiliate link does not imply our endorsement of the product or service unless explicitly stated. We might earn from products we believe in, but your satisfaction and trust are paramount.\n\nPrivacy and Data: When you click on an affiliate link, the third-party website might track your activity. This is beyond our control. We do not share your personal data with these third parties unless you make a purchase through our link, in which case, standard transaction data might be shared as part of the affiliate process.\n\nCookie Management: Some affiliate programs use cookies to track sales. If you disable cookies or use private browsing, you might not be tracked through our affiliate links, potentially affecting our commission but not your purchase or experience.\n\nChanges in Affiliate Programs: Affiliate programs and their terms can change. We will update this disclaimer accordingly, but it's your responsibility to check back for updates or changes.\n\nLiability Limitation: To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of affiliate links or the content provided through this extension.\n\nCompliance with Laws: We aim to comply with all relevant laws, including but not limited to those set by the FTC in the U.S. regarding affiliate marketing disclosure. However, laws vary by jurisdiction, and it's your responsibility to understand and comply with local laws.\nFeedback and Concerns: If you have any concerns or feedback regarding our use of affiliate links, please contact us. We value your trust and are here to address any issues you might encounter.\n\nBy continuing to use this extension, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this disclaimer.
