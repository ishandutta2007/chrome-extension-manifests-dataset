Finally the days of clicking 30 times on a very clunky date time picker are gone! Use the Zoho Regularise tool to fill in the form automagically.\n\nThe tool's functionality will grow with more requests from our users coming in, so feel free to leave your reviews and comments.\n\nNote: This tool is not officially supported by Zoho itself, it's a hobbyist endevour to speed up the process of filling in absent timesheets by the developer."
