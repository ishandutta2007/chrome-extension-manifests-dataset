Every day it will select one random activity from each category, and will wait for you to tick it off.\n\nCategories include “Social”, “Physical” and “Intellectual”, with activities like drawing a picture, listening to your favourite song, or holding lotus pose for 5'.\n\nThis isn't an app to pressure you, it's an app to reward you."
