Look for the spectacles icon at the top right.\nInstall to add the Student View link on every page at the top right (in the \"crumbs\" navigation pane) in the Canvas LMS. Enables quick toggling between Student View and regular view without extra navigation.\n\nNOTE: as of its December 19, 2020 release, Canvas implements its own built-in Student View link on most pages. This extension's link now is preset to become hidden on pages where the built-in link is shown, but other options can be selected (see Options page for more info).\n\nThis version works with any URL, but you will need to enable it by clicking the icon in the Chrome toolbar and choose \"Enable CQSV\" (see screenshot #2). If you have your Canvas hosted on a domain of the type *.instructure.com/* , you can instead use a parallel version of this extension, obtainable at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-quick-student-view/idkfmdcfofomdpiflkonjlcnllkffhoh  â€“ that version does not require manual enabling.\n\nPlease find the complete manual at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZKHJh4_61pG4fbn743XW4qTAUCr41xaI?usp=sharing\n\nPlease join https://groups.google.com/d/forum/canvas-quick-student-view for questions, bug reports etc."
