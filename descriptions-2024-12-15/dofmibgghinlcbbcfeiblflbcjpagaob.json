This is just a simple string search and replace, it's not going to Hack your Gibson. It does require permissions to read your data - but check the source for yourself. A few lines of javascript, everything is processed locally. \n\nHow is this helping? Well - Resistance starts at home, and it can still be funny. The head of the executive branch doesn't have to be the leader of the free world, and they don't have to be regarded as any leader by you. \n\n(Unless you're in the military in which case yes he is technically your boss and that probably sucks. Related: If you are in the military and are ordered to launch a nuclear first strike by this cheeto please take one for civilization and disobey that order. I Digress.) \n \nAnyway, enjoy this, and stay strong, kids. \n\nIf you really want to give me money Donate BTC why not sure: 1BL8LGhZpcDGcWci8eKAL4abSEnpkYJYhy"
