It helps nailing down bugs and issues which may occur during integration.\n\nAs this is still in beta please send feedback about all the things which may not function or Feature requests.\n\nUsage:\nTo position the window and remove overlays you can drag the window around on the website, and resize by pulling on the borders. The Extension will memorize the position and automatically display the inspector at this location going forward. The Memory is on a by domain basis. \n\nThe Stream will autoscroll bottom if you scrolled bottom. To stop autoscrolling you simply scroll up a bit."
