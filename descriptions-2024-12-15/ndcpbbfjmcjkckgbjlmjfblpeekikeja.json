The \"permissions\" are just access to Google services like Maps, that's how extensions work, nothing more!  Also, sadly, in Chrome on Mac OSX, the scrollbar for the list page is being hidden by the Mac, and the swipe gesture on the trackpad doesn't take over.  We love Mac users, but this one is out of our hands."
