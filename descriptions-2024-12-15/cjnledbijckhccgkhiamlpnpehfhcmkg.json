Let Omegle Automator do the work for you.\n\nAutomatically fill out interests and send messages using the Omegle Automator widget that will, after installing the extension, appear on the page on your next visit to the Omegle website.\n\nEnter your interests, create a message sequence, and choose a few basic configurations using the widget's 3 tabs. Then, click the \"Play\" button. After that, the bot will do the rest of the work!\n\nSo what happens when Omegle Automator finishes sending your sequence of messages to a stranger? It simply disconnects from the current chat and starts a new one. And wha if the stranger disconnects early before the bot has finished sending all the messages in the sequence? Omegle Automator is smart, and will detect that it's been disconnected on, then quickly start a brand new chat all on its own.\n\nWhy use Omegle Automator?\n\n1. Simple & accessible.\n\nMost Omegle bots require you to modify configuration files, have an at least basic understanding of programming, and also must be run via your computer's terminal. This extension provides an easy to use draggable-n-collapsable widget that makes it simple to configure and start the bot with zero coding experience.\n\n2. Reliable.\n\nI've built various Omegle automation tools (this is my fourth one), and have enough experience to understand and adequately handle all the edge cases the bot might be put through. This extension is being regularly maintained, and each new version will bring new features and bug fixes (the widget will let you know when a new version is available).\n\n3. Configurable.\n\nIt's extremely easy to add/remove messages to your sequence, as well as rearrange them by dragging them up or down. You can also choose how long the bot should wait between sending messages, how long to wait before sending the first message, and how long the bot should run before shutting itself off."
