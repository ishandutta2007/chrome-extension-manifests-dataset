The Netsweeper Chrome Client Filter will send all URL requests to a Netsweeper Policy Service to filter web surfing.  The Netsweeper Policy Service is configurable and can be set to any deployed Netsweeper system.  The policy service can be password protected by the Administrator of the policy service by setting a Client Filter uninstall password.  You can configure the Chrome Client FIlter using the gSuite enterprise policy or via the Windows Registry/MacOS pList files.  This allows you to customize and brand your defaults for all your users.\n\nWhen using the Netsweeper Client Filter the following data is transmitted to the Policy Service for filtering purposes:\n\nThe complete URL of each web request and all elements on a web page\nThe account name of the user signed into Chrome\nThe IP address of the workstation as seen by the Policy Service\n\nThe sole purpose of the Netsweeper Client Filter is to filter all URL requests and to extend the Netsweeper Policy Service and Client Filter platform to the Chrome browser.  The Netsweeper Client Filter for Chrome is free but does require a Netsweeper Policy Service to be installed and configured.\n\nNetsweeper Privacy Policy: https://www.netsweeper.com/privacy-policy/\nNetsweeper Support: https://www.netsweeper.com/support/\n\nFor more information feel free to email support@netsweeper.com"
