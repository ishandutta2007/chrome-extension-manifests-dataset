Use it to meet your style needs, or simply to make text easier to read. You can even randomize the color and size to spice things up! It's easy, fast and works right in the corner of your browser. Download Re-Font today!\n\nAdd your own custom fonts by clicking \"Add Font\" in the font selector. You can type in your own font or even add a link to one on the internet (Google fonts work best!) if it's not installed on your computer.\n\nCreate bookmarklets with your styles to send to friends, regardless of whether they have Re-Font installed.\n\nNote from developer: I am a student and made this for fun. If you find any bugs feel free to let me know or contribute to the code on GitHub. Any support is much appreciated!\n\nGithub: https://github.com/brayden-gg/Re-Font\nDonations: https://ko-fi.com/braydengg"
