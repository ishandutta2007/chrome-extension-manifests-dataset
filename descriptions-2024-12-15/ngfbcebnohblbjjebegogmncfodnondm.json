The extension will recognize forms fields by their attributes and and fill the fields with the value from the settings. Great for pages online job applications that ask you to fill out the same things over and over or fill out things that are already in the resume that's already uploaded. Can also work for anyone that spend a lot of time filling any web form or constantly paste the same values over and over again.\n\n*WARNING: DO NOT SAVE PASSWORDS INTO THIS PROGRAM. IT IS NOT MEANT FOR ANY DATA THAT ARE MEANT TO BE ENCRYPTED. IF IT IS INFO YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE IN SHARING WITH JOB RECRUITERS, INTERVIEWERS OR THE HR DEPARTMENT OF ANOTHER COMPANY, DO NOT SAVE IT HERE.*\n\n-version 1.7:\nGot a request for light mode. Added the functionality.\n-version 1.6:\nAdded a check for the path that the element was right-clicked on.\n-version 1.5:\nEvent Fill:\nSome forms require more than just having the field filled out, they require javascript events to be fired (usually happens via human input.) for them to recognize the field is filled. Added the \"Event Fill\" option to address those forms. For new users, this should be turned on by default. For users upgrading, this will need to be manually turned on.\nMinor changes:\nRemoved some console.log()'s that shouldn't be there.\nMade it so that when pasting via the right-click menu, even if the paste didn't happen successfully, it'll still be copied into your clipboard.\n-version 1.4:\nStyle change:\nIn settings, when you the fields to add a new entry, the width didn't transition along with min and max width in css, leading to a bad feeling in seeing it animated. Fixed that.\n-version: 1.3\nNew Feature:\nQuick Copy Floating Panel.\nWhen turned on, each page that you go to will have a floating panel of data. By mousing over it, it'll automatically copy said data into your clipboard for faster copy and pasting. Perfect for those forms that ask you to enter in work history despite already uploaded your resume.\n- version: 1.2\nBug fixes: \n1) Found and fixed bug where page reloads will add new event listeners on background script.\n2) Fixed bug where importing settings won't refresh profiles list on settings page.\n- version: 1.1\nMinor update to increase readability as to what is pasted as part of the console. Removed extraneous output accidentally left over."
