Thus, this extension will make it hard to view some web sites.\n\nFor maximum safety, you should also turn on Chrome’s Secure DNS (DNS over HTTPS) feature. There is no way (yet?) for an extension to turn this on for you, so you have to do it manually. To do so, go to the dots menu → Settings → Security, and then scroll down to Use Secure DNS. Select a provider or fill in your own. (You can also get to this setting by navigating to the URL chrome://settings/security?search=dns.)\n\nHTTP Nowhere is designed to be as simple as possible, and has no functionality other than upgrading connections. This is easy to see in the very short and simple implementation.\n\nIt needs no special permissions or access to the web pages you view. There is nothing to configure; HTTP Nowhere is either on or off."
