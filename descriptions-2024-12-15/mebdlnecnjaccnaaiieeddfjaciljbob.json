You can copy or save the QR code by right-clicking on it.\n\nCreating short URLs can be done with 0 clicks in the extension, and can also be done through a context menu (right click).\n\nThe layout of the popup highly customizable! You can choose to disable/enable any feature you want! You can also view your history of short URLs and can view the link statistics!\n\nUnlike other URL shortener extensions, there is no need for any extra permissions! We take your privacy into consideration by keeping everything we can offline. \n\nWe do not need access to any of your data and the QR code is generated offline using an open-source JavaScript library. \n\nThe short URLs are created using Is.gd API (this is the only thing done over the network), but no personal data is collected by us.\n\nIcons by HeroIcons\nhttps://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs"
