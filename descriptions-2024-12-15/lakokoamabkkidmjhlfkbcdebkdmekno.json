The user can then easily retrieve their job through a central print release station located within the public library. \n\n- Session/Time is managed by loading a landing page that covers the desktop and a user can only login by entering their library card number and pin/password provided by the public library. The extension connects to a cloud based server that will authenticate that library card number to the public library's record management service. Session time, session time out warnings/notifications are all displayed to the user and when those time expires, the user will be logged off and the computer will be available for the next user waiting to use the computer. \n\n- Filtering is also provided to ensure public libraries can choose what content is available to the user based on age through the use of proxy servers."
