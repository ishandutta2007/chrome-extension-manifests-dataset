Most of these end up in the trash can, whether they get recycled or not. This is a bane to the environment because of the amount of paper that is wasted, not to mention an utter annoyance for us to have to sift through them and find mails that are actually important. Junk Mail Be Gone helps you to stop specific catalogs by guiding you through all the different online forms on different websites."
