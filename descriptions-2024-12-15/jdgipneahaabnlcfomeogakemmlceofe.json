(Only does something on pages with a download button)\n\n1.5 Release Notes\n===============\n\nThumbsee 1.5 brings some great new features, such as the ability to move the download button. Now you can move the button next the the Join and Follow buttons, or to the right of the title, or you can always keep the default layout if that's what you really prefer. The next fantastic addition is the ability to auto hide the bottom popup. The popup is much too good at popping up, now you have the ability to make it *pop*. The final feature is the ability to enable/disable the entire extension with the flick of a switch. I don't know why you would ever want to disable it though.\n\n[Major]\n + Added option to move the download button, options include...\n  * Default: default button location\n  * Title: after title, make the button a bit smaller too\n  * Button Group: to the left of the Join button\n + Added option to hide bottom popup\n + Added option to enable/disable entire extension\n\n[Minor]\n + Changed naming on popout"
