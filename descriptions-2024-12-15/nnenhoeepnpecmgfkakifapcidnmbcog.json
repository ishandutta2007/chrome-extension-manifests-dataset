With the use of 'and/or' logic in search, finding the right image has never been easier. The extension also highlights the top 40 most-used words in all prompts for quick filtering. \n\nThe extension captures information from your Midjourney account page, storing it locally in your browser's localStorage. This allows it to use this data without delay and provides a better interface with added features like sorting by specific criteria or viewing the top words used in prompts."
