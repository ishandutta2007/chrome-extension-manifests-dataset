From just visiting to creating an account or placing an order, your digital footprint gets bigger and bigger, making it easy for internet companies or criminals to uncover and exploit your real identity.\n\nIn its role as personal data management software, the goal of Privci is to protect your personal data and digital identity by unravelling the privacy claims of the websites you visit.\n\n1 - One step closer to reality\nPrivci will demystify the privacy policy of the website you visit for answers to questions such as:\n  ● How does the site protect personal data?\n  ● Is the precise location of users inferred?\n  ● How long is personal data retained? \n  ● What have I agreed to as a user of the website?\n  ● What are my rights as a data subject?\n  ● Has the site added any well-known cookies to my browser?\n\n2 - Go online with confidence\nWith Privci, you will be equipped with tools that enable you to:\n  ● Keep track of websites that are collecting personal data about you\n  ● Ask the privacy policy your own questions\n  ● Request data access, erasure, rectification of any data held about you, and more\n\n3 - Decide who keeps your personal data\nPrivci’s opt-out management feature makes opting out a simple and convenient process.
