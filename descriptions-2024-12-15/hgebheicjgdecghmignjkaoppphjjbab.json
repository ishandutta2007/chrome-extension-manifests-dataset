With this handy extension you can create an enlarged, high-contrast, readily accessible version of that URL that is easier for students to see. To use, simply visit a webpage and click on the extension icon. The enlarged URL should appear at the top of the screen and will stay in place as you scroll. Clicking a second time on the extension icon (or on the enlarged URL) causes the enlarged URL to disappear. Properly displays localhost as well as IP addresses. Works with HTTP and HTTPS. Displays search queries being passed in the URL. If you find a URL that the extension doesn't work with, please let me know!\n\nThere is also a paid version of BigURL called BigURL Pro that provides extra features.\n\nWith BigURL Pro you gain the ability to modify the URL font size, as well as highlight and add/remove URL fragments. So instead of displaying \"http://some-url.com/?searchQuery\" you can opt to hide the http protocol and search query and simply display \"some-url.com\".  This makes the URL shorter and thus easier for students to read."
