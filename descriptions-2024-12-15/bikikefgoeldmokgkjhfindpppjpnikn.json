Flow Focus is a simple, bare-bones approach to tracking your time on websites. By default, Flow Focus keeps a running daily count of all your visits to a website. If you notice that you're visiting one site a bit too often, simply tell Flow Focus to set an alert for that site and you'll receive notifications every 3rd, 7th, 10th and every time thereafter for the remainder of the day. After every day, your numbers reset.\n\nFlow Focus does not share any information about your browsing history with any third party. When you visit a website, we count the number of times you've visited it -- that's it. No information is collected upon visiting a website other than logging another visit count. Every day, your visit data for the previous day is purged and the visit counts reset."
