Chronos takes care of it.\n\nCreate a new task, give it a description and assign a color to it, and you're ready to go. \n\nClick on the colored timer when you're ready to start timing your task, and Chronos will start logging your time in the background, leaving you to get on with your work.\n\nWhen you're done, click on the timer again to stop timing. Then when you're ready to fill in your time-sheets , go to the totals panel to view the total amount of time spent on each task for each day of the week. \n\nChronos works across Chrome, Edge and Firefox\n\nLook out for the Professional version of Chronos offering many more useful features, coming soon."
