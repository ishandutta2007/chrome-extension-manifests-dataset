Block them.\n\nCoro-NO is enabling you to either cover all the posts with a warning about the infected content of the post or skip those posts entirely.\n\nAre most of the post you’re seeing in other than English language? Add more words and prevent „Coro-post“ in multiple languages from popping up.\n\nWhat's new in v0.5\n- We made it easy to share Coro-NO to your friends\n\nWhat's new in v0.4\n- Fixed layout for new Facebook design\n- Added Dark mode for new Facebook design"
