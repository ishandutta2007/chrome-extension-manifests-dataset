This extension will leave the latest comment from any of the defined bots, but hide any older comments.\n\nBy default, the bot prefixes used are the most common ones found in MicrosoftDocs repos. You can change these to add new prefixes, remove existing ones, or replace the default list entirely.\n\nNow, enjoy GitHub comment minimizer with far fewer permission requirements! As of version 0.5.0, only the storage permission is required to save your custom bot prefix list.\n\n(NOTE: Prior versions of this extension would allow for hiding comments permanently via an official GitHub mechanism. This required elevated permissions, restricting the usefulness. As of version 0.4.0, this extension will only hide comments visually within your browser. Nothing is persisted on GitHub and will require the browser extension be installed for anyone else wanting to experience comment hiding.)"
