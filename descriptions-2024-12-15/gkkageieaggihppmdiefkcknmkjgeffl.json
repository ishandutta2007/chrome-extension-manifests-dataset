Whether you need to download files, images, pdf, video, zip, rar, dpc, or other content in bulk, this tool provides a seamless way to extract and download all links from a webpage in just a few clicks.\n\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of All Links Downloader is its user-friendly interface. The extension integrates smoothly into the browser, and its operation is intuitive enough for even non-tech-savvy users to navigate easily. Once installed, a simple click on the extension icon scans the entire webpage and displays all available links. Users can then select the specific types of files they want to download, such as images, documents, or compressed files, making the process highly customizable.\n\nThe filtering options add another layer of convenience. You can filter links based on file type (extension) allowing you to download exactly what you need without excess clutter. For users managing large amounts of data, this feature ensures a smooth and efficient experience."
