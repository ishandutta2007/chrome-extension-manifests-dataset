The higher the score, the more relevant the content is to your task. An averaged score (\"mean rating\") is calculated to reflect your current level of focus. If it falls below 0.5, the extension considers you to be distracted and intervenes according to the settings.\n\nFeatures:\n- Theme Nudging: Your browser toolbar will be colored in a bright red tone if you get distracted to increase your mindfulness.\n- Identify Distracting Tabs: Automatically identify tabs that are likely unrelated to your current task and decide whether to close them or save them for later.\n- LLM-assisted Conversation: Engage in a focused conversation with an AI assistant to get back on track or reflect on why you got distracted.\n- Dashboard: View your similarity score history and see when you were most focused or distracted.\n\nFor a detailed manual and an optional server to score all programs instead of just your browser, check out the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Marc-Pk/ProcrastiScan"
