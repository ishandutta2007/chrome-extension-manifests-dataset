As in the first episode, you play as a night guard, whose task is not only to protect the restaurant but also to stay alive and donâ€™t let robots kill you. \n\nAnimatronics are mechanical creatures from the pizzeria. The task is to monitor the surveillance cameras and close the doors leading to the security office on time. In addition, it is necessary to monitor the power consumption, because when you will be out of power, the robots can easily get access to the security room.\n\nHow to Play\nUse the mouse to direct your vision\nClick the Door buttons to open/close doors\nClick the Light buttons to turn on/off lights\nMonitor the security cameras to track the movements of the animatronics (hovering the mouse over the button at the bottom of the screen will show/hide the camera panel)\n\nGood luck in the amazing game FNAF 2 Unblocked."
