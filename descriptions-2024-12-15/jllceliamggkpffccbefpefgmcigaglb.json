They can then be sent via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Teams, Gmail, and every other online platform.\n\nYou can finally talk about physics, mathematics, chemistry, and (even) chess with your friends! There are more than 1000 commands and you can even create your own! They are quite easy to remember, especially if you are already familiar with LaTeX! If not, simply open the completion popup!\n\nCopy and paste \" H(t) | \\psi (t) \\rangle = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}| \\psi (t) \\rangle \" in the upper square, click \"Convert\" and see what happens! \n\nSimple, free, and open-source!\n\n\n\n** Documentation **\nFull and comprehensive documentation is available if you put your mouse above the question mark (?) on the top right corner of the popup that will appear once you open MatTalX."
