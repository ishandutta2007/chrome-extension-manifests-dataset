It then searches the webpage for the article and then finds the finds author and political buzzwords based on a precompiled list. The list of political buzzwords are from https://www.isidewith.com/polls. Once it has found a word it the extension then tries to determine the context the word is used in. Then it assigns a score to the word based on whether it is conservative or liberal. After it has found all of the buzzwords and judged them, it generates the final score by taking the ( score / total buzz words ) * 100. A positive score means that the article has a liberal bias and if the score is negative then the article has a conservative bias. If the score is zero, then it has no bias. \n\n\nThis project is open source and we are looking for improvements and new ideas. \n\nhttps://github.com/d3bird/PAC-meter\n\n\nAuthors\n\nScott Crawford\nJoey Cunningham\nTim Minear\nJesse Runner"
