Often times, beauty clinics claim they have the greatest and latest technologies to provide the treatment; but they lack the professional talent to execute the technologies. Non surgical liposuction comes in a few forms where they require precise and technical training in order for the results to truly shine through. There are four main types of non surgical liposuction:\n1. Low level Laser - This involves taking a low level laser and directing it to the fatty area, which reduces the stability of adipocyte cell membranes; this then allows the cells to release the fat storage without damaging any of the cells. With this method, exercise is highly recommended with this procedure since exercise helps increase lymph flow. When finding a clinic that offers low level laser liposuction, make sure they mention exercise to ensure they are credible.\n2. Ultrasound - This technique involves raising the tissue temperature to over 55 degrees Celsius to create coagulation in the adipocyte cell membranes. With this method, you will feel a slight heating sensation to the skin, which helps induce collagen remodeling. \n3. Radiofrequency - This form of non surgical liposuction creates an electric field over the skin that shifts the polarity a million times per second. \n4. Cryolipolysis - Also known as lipo freezing, this method involves the cooling and freezing of tissues to create the fat cells to die and pass through the body. \nThere are many factors to consider before deciding on a clinic to have your procedure done. Price, location, and quality are three of the top main criteria when choosing a clinic. Make sure to do your research thoroughly to avoid having the procedure done by someone who is inexperienced in what they are doing.\nWhen choosing a non surgical liposuction clinic, take into consideration the type of procedure you are getting and whether they have the professionals to perform such a specialized procedure. With our database of clinics, lipmagic.com has compiled a list of clinics in a city close to you that can provide a top quality treatment you can trust.
