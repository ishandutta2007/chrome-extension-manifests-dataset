Individual threads can be muted, after which they will not show up in a forum's thread list (nor will they show up in egosearch or thread searches). If going directly to the URL of a muted thread, the posts in that thread will be faded to 10% opacity.\n\nTo mute a thread, simply click the speaker icon that shows up on the right side of the address bar when viewing that thread. (Clicking it again will unmute the thread.)\n\n(Note: Posts in muted threads will still show up in post search results.)\n\n======= New in 1.0.4 =======\n\n- Fixed a bug with manifest v2.\n\n======= New in 1.0.2 =======\n\n- Option to only hide threads from egosearch, not from other places and no fading."
