It only works for the root folder if you are in the My Drive view, not the home view.\n\nThis saves time and simplifies sharing folder contents with colleagues or team members, making it invaluable for project management and digital asset organization. The extension integrates seamlessly into your Google Drive interface, requiring no additional software or complex setups.\n\nWith Drive Links Generator, you can experience a new level of efficiency and organization in managing and sharing your digital files and transform how you access and share your Google Drive folders."
