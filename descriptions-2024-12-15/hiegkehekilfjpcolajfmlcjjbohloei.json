You meant to click on the first thing, and it seems obvious to everyoneâ€”that is, everyone but your browser. That's the problem Not So Fast solves.\n\nNot So Fast detects when elements have moved near your mouse and sets up a short \"grace period\" where any accidental clicks are ignored. This prevents unintended actions, like pressing the wrong button, losing your place on the page, or opening dangerous links. The added security also reduces the cognitive load of using your pointing device of choice, making for a more pleasant browsing experience.\n\nThe extension is currently in beta, so feedback is welcome!"
