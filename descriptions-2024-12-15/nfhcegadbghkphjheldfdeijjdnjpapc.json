An icon will appear next to the url bar, just click on it to add a note. The notes are auto-saved as you type. \n\nYou can view all your notes by going the 'All notes' page. Notes are saved along with the url for easy access. No more hundreds of open tabs, just add note to each tab, close it and come back to it later. \nYou can sort the notes by date. And search option is available too, useful when you have many notes. \n\nAll the notes are saved in local storage of your browser, so no worries about data privacy. \n\nThe code for this extension is available on github, feel free to contribute and improve the product, or customize it for your needs."
