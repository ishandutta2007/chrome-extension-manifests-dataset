Here’s what it does and why it can be an invaluable tool for school administrators and IT staff:\n\nUpon login, the extension collects:\nUser Email: Identifies who is using the device, providing traceability for each login.\nUser Profile Information: Retrieves the user’s first and last name, making it easy to match logins with individuals.\nDevice Serial Number and Asset ID: Helps in tracking each specific Chromebook, allowing schools to manage their devices accurately.\nIP Address: Logs the location of the device during each session for added security insights.\nLogin Date and Time: Captures the exact timestamp of each login event, creating a clear timeline of device use.\nAll collected information is sent securely to a designated Google Sheets document. This creates a centralized, real-time log that authorized school personnel can access as needed.\n\nBenefits for Schools\nThis extension is especially beneficial for school environments, providing multiple advantages:\n\nStudent and Staff Device Management: Track who is using which device, when, and where, supporting security, accountability, and efficient distribution of resources.\nResource Planning: By logging usage patterns, IT staff can plan for device maintenance, upgrades, and replacements, ensuring that each Chromebook remains in optimal condition.\nEnhanced Security Monitoring: The logging of IP addresses and login timestamps allows administrators to monitor device access and identify any unusual patterns, adding a layer of security.\nCentralized Reporting: With data automatically updated in Google Sheets, administrators gain instant access to reports for audits, troubleshooting, or other analyses—saving time on manual tracking.\nThis extension helps schools efficiently monitor and manage their Chromebook fleet, supporting accountability, safety, and the effective use of resources across educational networks."
