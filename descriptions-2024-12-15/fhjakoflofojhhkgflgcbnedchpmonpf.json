Each time you shop via cashback charity across numerous online stores and platforms, a small percentage of your shopping cart value is going to be redistributed to you.\n\nAnother part is being reserved to be donated to a charity organization of your choice. During periodical voting events, the community has the power to decide, where their money should be donated.\n\nWe are currently in development, you can install the plugin now to stay up to date and be one of the first to signup.\n\nPlease note:\nAmazon purchases are excluded from the Cashback program. Generated Cash will be available for donation only."
