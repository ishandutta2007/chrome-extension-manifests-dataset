Use the Service Watch extension in conjunction with the CloudReady subscription to troubleshoot application slowdowns, triage network issues, and decipher connectivity problems.\n\nThis extension captures network diagnostics and user experience for any app, any location, and any network. Limit data to just the apps or SaaS services that need diagnosing. Capture session metrics across servers, SSO, Proxies, LAN/WAN, WiFi, and VPNs at home or on the road.\n\nTo get the most out of Real User Monitoring, correlate it with CloudReady Synthetics. Real User Monitoring is great for diagnosing specific user or network issues but for a complete picture, deploy Service Watch along with CloudReady Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring gives you a long-term baseline of your appsâ€™ performance, advance notice of problems, and a historical record to refer back to. Real user monitoring lets you pin point specific locations on the fly and drill into what a real user is really seeing."
