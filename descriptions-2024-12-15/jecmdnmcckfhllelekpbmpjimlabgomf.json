You also must be logged in.\n\nThis extension allows you to view and export (to CSV) lists of users you follow or who follow you on Instagram. There's also a special list called \"Not Mutual\" that shows users you follow but don't follow you back. Another interesting feature is the \"Ignored\" list, where you can specify a username to be ignored from \"Not Mutual\" list. \n\nThese features are useful for you to manage who you follow, who follows you and find out who don't follow you back."
