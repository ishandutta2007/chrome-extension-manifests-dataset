This process of \"pre-carting\" a product makes it easier to purchase it when it becomes available in stock. This method is used to help combat the excessive bots that are buying up all the stock.\n\nIn order to use the extension you must be signed in to an account on https://www.bestbuy.ca/. Then simply copy the Web Code from the product page and paste it in the SKU field and click Add to cart. The card will then be added to your cart. There are some instances where an error may pop up informing you to delete your cookies. If this is the case, click Delete Cookies and sign in once again.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/fofsfofs/BestBuy-Extension/tree/master"
