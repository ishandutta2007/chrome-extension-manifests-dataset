Prevent dry and itchy eyes, and preserve your vision. \n\nDARK MODE FOR SERVICE CLOUD LIGHTNING \nNo need to adjust org settings or ask your Salesforce Admin to do so. You can easily switch from and black to a light theme. You can also tweak contrast and brightness levels in advanced settings.\n\nNIGHT SHIFT\nWhen staring at a computer screen, we get affected by the harsh blue light it emits. The cold undertone of the screen is proven to harm our sleep and vision. The Night Shift feature decreases your exposure to blue light, making it soft and warm. \n\nYou can turn the Night Shifts on and off when you need to."
