With unlimited space, we rather archive messages we want to hide from main inbox. GMail interface provides quick action for each email, where Archive is next to Delete. By accidentally clicking Delete, you woun't be able to find your email by global search - even though your email is still present in your Trash for next 30 day after deletion! This extension helps you to avoid such situation by hiding Delete quick action button from action menu. Happy archiving!"
