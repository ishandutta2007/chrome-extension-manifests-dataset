For some reasons, the site designers overlook or ignore the fact that people use tabs these days, and one might open a bunch of tabs before reviewing each one of the pages. When this is done, multiple pages start to play their content, creating a disturbing noise.\n\nQuieNet is a Chrome extension that prevents videos from being automatically played. The extension hooks Ynet pages, and replaces media player with a stub. When the stub is clicked by the user, the original player is restored, and the video is played.\n\nNew in version 2.0\n===================\n* Video autoplay is cleanly prevented, without replacing the video player.\n* Autoplay is prevented even if player is not the first one on the page."
