I created TabBot and, within 24 hours, was able to purchase one after being alerted a payment button finally appeared on the page. The TabBot page monitor /autorefresher extension gives you peace of mind and allows you to do better things with your time than refreshing the same dozen pages over and over again. Simply leave TabBot running in the background and let it work like a fishing pole.\n\nWhile there are other product monitors out there, they often require you to pay expensive membership fees or surrender reams of personal information to use. TabBot runs in your own browser and requires zero exchanges of data outside your local browser.\n\nMy goal is keep this app as open and accessible as possible and save my users time and stress; no one likes to endlessly manually refresh a page. \n\nQuestions or comments?
