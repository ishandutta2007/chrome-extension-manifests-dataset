Also new features will be added. Some currently being hashed out are a whitelist for URLs you don't want closed and an options page that allows for more control over which tabs close. Currently this suits my purposes but it may not suit everyone! ***\n\nThis extension does require permissions to be able to view all of your tabs. You'll see very ominous permission warnings about this extension being able to view your data on all websites and access your tabs and browsing history. This data goes nowhere and the current version of the code can be inspected at the website URL listed under additional information."
