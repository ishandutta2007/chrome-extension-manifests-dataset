Download to get involved in testing on Vega and participate in Fairground incentives to earn rewards! The Vega Wallet extension is available as a mainstream release that is more stable.\n\nInstalling the extension injects a Vega API for dApps and websites to interact with keys and send transactions to Vega networks.  The wallet is in active development and new features are expected to be rolled out often.\n\nBy using the Vega Wallet, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the Vega Wallet User Data Policy here: https://vega.xyz/vega-wallet-user-data-policy/\n\nSpot an issue? Provide feedback here: https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/discussions\n\nNote:\n\nYou should only have 1 of the \"Vega Wallet - Beta\" and \"Vega Wallet\" extensions active at any given time. Both may be installed but only one should be enabled, to prevent unexpected behaviour."
