Once you click the icon or press Ctrl+B, the page will keep scrolling to its bottom until you click the icon again or load the entire page. It is a solution for the web sites that load more content as the users reach the bottom of the page. You typically see variations of the infinite scroll in social networking sites or online shops. \n\nHowever you do it, it can be annoying to scroll down and wait for more content. Spinning hard a mouse wheel or dragging a scrollbar handle that jumps back up is sometimes is not a nice user experience. It is nicer to first load the content and then to browse through it, particularly if you are interested in the text contents.\n\nA simple use case: You want to look for a keyword using Ctrl+F box on a web page where all the contents are loaded only after the page bottom is reached many times. Unfortunately the google search can serve as an example. Without the extension, it is not a difficult but also not enjoyable repetitive task trying to reach the end of the page as the search results continue to load and move the end away. With the extension, you click or press Ctrl+B and wait a bit. \n\nThe extension's code is explained in https://marian-caikovski.medium.com/how-to-use-ctrl-f-in-web-pages-with-infinite-scrolling-ef71c2382838"
