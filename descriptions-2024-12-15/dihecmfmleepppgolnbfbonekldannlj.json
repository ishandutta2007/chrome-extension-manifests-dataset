This bot will buy you new levels (with or without upgrades), click the enemies, use the built-in free buffs and keep pushing forward to new areas. Meanwhile, people like you and me can participate in the so-called \"real life\".\n\nNote that this extension comes with a native Windows .Net program, which is required in order to send mouse clicks to the flash game window. (Full source code included for those with a CRX viewer.)\n\nEnjoy!"
