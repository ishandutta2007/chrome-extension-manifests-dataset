No more combing through the source code to understand if/when canonical tags point to a new destination. This extension does all the heavy lifting for you.\n\nThis extension will display one of three values. GREEN (self canonical) AMBER (Canonicalized) or RED (error)\n\n\nBelow are the conditions Inspect Canonical tests for, in the order it tests for them:\n \nRED:\n1. Page contains noindex robots meta\nMessage: \"Page contains robots 'noindex' tag. Canonical tags are ignored. Click to view source\"\n \n2. No canonical in head but there is one elsewhere\nMessage: \"Canonical tag exists but not in <head>. Click to view source\"\n \n3. No canonical tag at all\nMessage: \"Page has no canonical tag. Click to view source\"\n \n4. More than one canonical tag on page\nMessage: \"Multiple ([X]) canonical tags found. Click to view source\"\n \n5. Canonical exists but is missing the href attribute\nMessage: \"Canonical tag is missing 'href' attribute. Click to view source\" - This is an unlikely case but still something I wanted to check for\n \nAMBER:\n6. Canonical present but differs to current URL\nMessage: \"Canonical tag points to another URL. Click to visit URL: [URL]\"\n \nGREEN:\n7. Canonical is present and correct\nMessage: \"Canonical tag points to current URL. Click to view source\"\n \nSo that's 7 hurdles to jump through to get a green status."
