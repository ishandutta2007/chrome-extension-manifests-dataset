In the first table you can add or remove villages and in the second one you can add or remove units models.\nThe page has also a Save button but all the changes are stored as they are performed so you don't need to worry!\n\nStep 3\nNow you have all setup and running.\nTo start farming MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ONLY ONE TAB OF THE GAME OPEN and click the model you want to use. Now you may see your attack been placed in the next seconds et voil√°!\n\nFAQ's\n\nWill I get banned for using this extension?\nYou may use this extension by your own risk but nobody has been banned for using it. The tool is simply a \"click automation\" and 0% intrusive.\n\nDoes this extension works in all worlds and all countries?\nYes, the tool was designed and built to run in every world of every country.\n\nHow many units models/templates can I store?\nUnlike the in-game assistant that only allows you to store 2 models, this extension allows you to store unlimited number of models.\n\nDoes this tool replace the in-game farm assistant?\nNo, some of the aspects different from the in-game assistant that you need to be aware are:\n- Villages coordinates need to be added manually.\n- Because the coordinates are manually inserted you must keep an eye on the reports you get to make sure that the village stills abandoned and that you are not losing unnecessary troops.\n- There isn't any visual sign when the attack command is placed (besides the page reload) so you have to make sure you only click once or you you will end up placing multiple attacks to the same village.\n- The extension doesn't take into consideration if you have sufficient units to place the attack, although if you don't the attack won't be placed.\n\n\nAs a lover of Tribalwars I developed and shared this tool with the only intent of providing a free farm alternative to all the game lovers."
