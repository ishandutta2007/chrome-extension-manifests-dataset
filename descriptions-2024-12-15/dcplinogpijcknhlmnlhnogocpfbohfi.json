Anyone can start using Graphite individually without needing their coworkers to change tools - we'll seamlessly sync your code changes and reviews.  We built Graphite because we missed internal code review tools like Phabricator (at Facebook) and Critique (Google) that help engineers create, approve, and ship small, incremental changes, and long-term weâ€™re passionate about creating products & workflows that help fast-moving eng teams achieve more."
