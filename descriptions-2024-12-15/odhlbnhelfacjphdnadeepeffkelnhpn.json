This extension, The Clock, will exactly present to you what you want to know! \n\nInstead of having to remember the time difference between time zones, within on click onto the extension icon on your upper right hand corner, you can immediately access the time for different time zones!\n\nIn this project, I aimed to provide a minimalist approach towards the presentation of clocks - making the UI simple to manage. What you have to do is to type the time zone into the text field and the supported time zones will appear below it. If you want a certain time zone to be included but you can't find it from the current ones provided, feel free to reach out and comment in the comment section of which area zones you want to be added! Also feel free to give improvement suggestions in the comments tabs! I would love to listen to you guys for improvements since it is also my first Google Extension! \n\nThis app also facilitates interactions between people in different time zones. For example, if you want to collaborate with other people in other time zones on projects, sometimes it is hard to remember or figure out the time, hence it may cause confusions. With this extension, within a click, you can immediately retrieve the information you need without the need to swipe away from the webpage you are reading from, which make things easier. \n\nSome advantages of using this clock:\n- Provides instant time for 150+ Countries/places!\n- Simple UI which users can add a few clocks that they want into the list.\n- Display both Analog and Digital time.\n- Users do not need to swipe away from their current webpage to retrieve time.\n- Minimalist design which works well with Chrome\n- Daylight Saving Time issues are automatically taken care of, and indicated in the extension for the region.\n\n\nPlease feel free to try out my tab and review! Thanks very much~\n\n(P.S. credits to CoolClock at http://randomibis.com/coolclock/ for their design of the analog clock)\n\nNewest Update(Version 1.0.0.11):\nUpdated the Daylight saving code such that it reflects coherent DST changes. \n\nImplemented Sortable on time canvases for easier arrangements of the canvases. Thanks RubaXa for his project on Sortable!\nSortable: https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable"
