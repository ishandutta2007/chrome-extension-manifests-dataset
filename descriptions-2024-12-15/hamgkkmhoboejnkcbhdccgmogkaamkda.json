It provides several quality-of-life modifications to speed up and improve your workflow.\n\nIf any tweak doesn't suit your needs or is broken, you can disable the tweak in the extension popup. Tweaks may break at any time as Google updates Classroom. I created this extension for my wife, who is a teacher, so I will prioritize adding and maintaining tweaks that are useful for her. \n\nStill, if you have any issues or features you would like to request, please do so on this Google Form:\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6i08Seb7Bcn4CMvtmoBXVAR39Oy3QI19gMT4wITD2FazuyQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\nIf you would like to make a donation to support ongoing development of Classroom Tweaks, you can via Ko-fi:\nhttps://ko-fi.com/F2F4SH2KS\n\nThe source code is available to view on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/michaelbauchert/classroom-tweaks\n\n***\n\nList of Tweaks\n- Contextual Class Links:\nWhen switching between classes, this tweak keeps you on the currently selected tab (i.e. Stream, Classwork, People, and Grades). That way, you can switch classes, without switching the task you were working on.\n\n- Expandable Topics:\nIn the Classwork tab, this tweak hides the contents of each topic by default. Click the empty space of any topic to view the contents within. You can still navigate to each topic's page by clicking the text of the topic. This tweak makes rearranging and organizing your topics much easier, as you can click and drag each topic as well as expand relevant topics to move contents between them.\n\n- Skip to Grading Page Links:\nIn the Grades tab, this tweak adds buttons, labeled Grade, for each assignment. These buttons act as direct links to the grading page.\n\n- Grading Page Keyboard Shortcuts:\nThis tweak adds keyboard shortcuts to Google Classroom's grading page. You can change any of keys that trigger each shortcut to any alphanumeric character as well as -, =, /, Home, or End.\n\nList of Shortcuts\n- Change Grade\n-- Default Key: G\n\n- Leave Comment\n-- Default Key: C\n\n- First Student\n-- Default Key: Home\n\n- Last Student\n-- Default Key: End\n\n- Next Student\n-- Default Key: D\n\n- Previous Student\n-- Default Key: A\n\nNote that when focus is within specific contexts, some or all keyboard shortcuts will not trigger. These situations are as follows:\n\nAssignment (Google Doc, PDF, etc.):\n- Disallowed Keys: all\t\n- Assignments are embedded documents separate from the page. Keyboard events that occur within those embeds cannot be monitored. Scrolling the assignment without moving focus to within it is possible, therefore keyboard shortcuts may still work after simply scrolling.\n\nGrade Input\n- Disallowed Keys: Home, End, -, Numeric Characters\n- The disallowed characters may be needed to input a grade.\n\nPrivate Comments Input\n- Disallowed Keys: all\t\n- Any character assigned as a shortcut could also be needed to write a comment."
