It's particularly useful for identifying the version build commit that comes after a user's Merge PR commit.\n\nKey Features:\n\nSearch Specific Commits: Find git commits by a specific author that occur after a Merge PR commit by another author.\nIdentify Version Builds: Determine the version build commit (e.g., \"Version build 1.2.0\") that includes the content of a user's Merge PR.\nUser-Friendly Interface: Select a completed PR ID and quickly get the corresponding version build commit name.\n\nUse Case Example: \n\nMany users make git Merge PR commits to Azure DevOps git. After several user commits, an automatic \"Version build 1.2.0\" commit is generated. With this extension, users can select their completed PR ID and find the version build commit name that indicates the first version containing their PR content."
