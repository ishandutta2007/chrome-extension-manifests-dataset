Sankofa remembers the content of websites you visited, and indexes that content on Vectara. Then you can us Sankofa to research the pages you visited: ask questions (ChatGPT style), search for pages on a certain topic or find similar pages to a page you are on right now.\n\nTo use Sankofa you need to sign-up for your free Vectara account, and create a corpus. This corpus is where Sankofa will store all the text of pages you want it to index for you.\n\nOnce you configure Sankofa with your Vectara account, you can index pages you visit, or just text from those pages. You can also instruct Sankofa to automatically index every page you visit after a certain delay. And when you search, Sankofa uses Vectara's Generative AI capabilities to generate a response based on the content of pages you visited and indexed in Vectara."
