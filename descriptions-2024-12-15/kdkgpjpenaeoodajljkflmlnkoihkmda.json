Re-built from the original popular LeetHub extension, it improves and expands upon the original, now featuring support for the new Leetcode UI. \n\nWhy LeetHub?\n1. Recruiters *want* to see your contributions to the Open Source community, be it through side projects, solving algorithms/data-structures, or contributing to existing OS projects. \nAs of now, GitHub is developers' #1 portfolio. LeetHub just makes it much easier (autonomous) to keep track of progress and contributions on the largest network of engineering community, GitHub.\n2. There's no easy way of accessing your leetcode problems in one place! \nMoreover, pushing code manually to GitHub from Leetcode is very time consuming. So, why not just automate it entirely without spending a SINGLE additional second on it?\n\nHow does LeetHub work?\nAfter installing the extension and launching LeetHub, it's as simple as:\n1. Click on \"authorize with GitHub\" button to automatically set up your account with LeetHub.\n2. Setup an existing/new repository with LeetHub (private by default) by clicking \"Get Started\" button.\n3. And that's it ðŸŽ‰ ...begin Leetcoding! To view your progress, simply click on the LeetHub icon!\n\nBONUS: Star LeetHub v3 on GitHub for further development of features @ https://github.com/raphaelheinz/LeetHub-3.0\n\nLet's see you ACE that coding interview!"
