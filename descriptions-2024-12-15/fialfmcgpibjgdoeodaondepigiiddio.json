Its a way-better bookmarks manager, but it's also a browser manager, a tabs manager and a session manager. It's a replacement for tools like Tabs Outliner, but it's mostly a personal knowledge management system that allows you to organize all of your online information sources (web sites, Google docs, gmails, files, photos, Slack channels, social media groups, code repos, wiki pages, task backlogs, Jupyter notebooks, etc etc etc), combine them with your text-based notes and see the big picture in the tree structured side panel. It's the plain text bookmarking tool that I always wanted to exist but could never find, so I built it. I hope you like it!\n\n\n-------  RELEASE NOTES  --------\n# BrainTool 1.2\nThe notable change in 1.2 is the ability to run the Topic Manager in the browsers side panel. It kind-of feels like BT has been pulled inside the browser!\n\n#BrainTool 1.1\nAutomatic local backups or recent, daily and monthly changes. Also:\n- Improved scrolling and arrow key support for search and row navigation.\n- Removed/defaulted settings for Sticky tabs and Tab Groups\n- Removed Notes toggle, replaced with resize control.\n- Improved discoverability of Supporter purchase buttons\n- Added uninstall feedback survey\n- bug fixes, performance improvements\n\n# BrainTool 1.0.3\nMinor release addressing some bugs and UI feedback. \n- Improved handling of dragging tabs between tabgroups and windows.\n- Added 'w' as a keyboard command for 'open in new Window'.\n- Improved handling of screen configuration changes.\n\n# BrainTool 1.0.2\nUnfinished business from 1.0 and updates based on 1.0 feedback \n## Feature Updates\n- Added topic expansion on hover so folded topics can be dropped into (thanks @rocketman455 for the suggestion!)\n- Improvements to the upgrade process to make it clearer whats happening.\n- Added trial expiration and initial nagging 30 days after installation.\n- GitHub #32: When TopicMgr is in a tab - don't navigate on item deletion. If the browser is maximized don't adjust its position on first opening TM. \n\n## Fixes\n- Better handling for gdrive cert expiry on save when Google Authorization popup is blocked.\n- GutHub #33: Fixed regex to not clobber org properties.\n- Improvements to tracking sticky tabs.\n- Various refactoring and error handling housekeeping.\n\n# Welcome to BrainTool 1.0!\nHere is an overview of whats new.\n## Manifest V3\nThis change is not of great interest to a BT user but is mandated by Google and required non-trivial code changes.\n\n## Full Tab Group Support\nOne advantage of the manifest update is that it provides access to the tabgroup api so that BT can provide full synchronization between Topics and browser tabgroups. By default Topics are now shown as tabgroups in the browser. Tabs opened from BT open in a tabgroup labelled with the appropriate Topic. In the Topic Manager open links and Topics are highlighted with the tabgroups color. Changing the tabgroups color in the browser is reflected in the Topic Manager. Name changes and expand/collapse operations are also synced.\n\nAdditionally dragging a tab into a tabgroup will save that tab into the Topic in BT. Dragging a saved tab out of its tabgroup will remove it from BrainTool.\n\n## Sticky Tabs\nWhen 'Sticky Tabs' is enabled the relationship between a tab and an associated saved item in the Topic Manager is maintained when you click a link in the saved tab or during a server side redirection. This allows you to navigate around a saved site or app, or get redirected to a different url (for example to a log-in page) while staying in the context of the original saved BT Item.\n\n## Topic Tree visuals\nThe expand/collapse buttons and the favicon displays have been restyled, and an empty topic is now visually distinct. It is hoped that these changes make the tree structure easier to see, in addition to improving the styling in general.\n\n## Session saving and Bookmarker Updates\nThe BT Bookmarker now has the option to save a whole tabgroup (if the current tab is in one), and a complete session, in addition to the previous window and tab options. When saving a session, tab groups are saved as the corresponding BrainTool Topic. Any ungrouped tabs are put in a tabgroup named with a Window-N prefix and saved under a Topic with the same name in the Topic Manager. The Session itself is given a Session-date Topic name and saved under the Topic selected in the Bookmarker or the Scratch default Topic.\n\n## Preferences for Dense, Hide Notes, Tooltips and Large Font\nNew preferences have been added for these items.\n\n## New Introductory Screens\nWe've added a helpful BrainTool Buddy to give a gentle introduction to BT when it's initially installed and at launch thereafter, until turned off.\n\n## GDrive Auth Change\nAnother Google mandated update is the change to use their Auth 2.0 libraries for Google Drive authorization. Unfortunately the access provided to browser-based apps (ie those without a back-end server) is considered to be temporary access and to require explicit user interaction. If you have GDrive saving turned on you'll be warned in the red warning banner when the token expires. You can click to immediately re-auth or ignore it and re-auth will happen on the next save.\n\n## Usability Improvements\n- Rows in the Topic Manager can now be dragged by selecting anywhere on the row\n- The Tab key now iterates a selected Topic through three states: collapsed, open with its child nodes showing and open with its children all fully expanded.\n- Search has been improved to make it easier to see the current match and other visible matches.\n\n## Pricing and License Changes for 1.0\n- There will be no limits on numbers of nodes saved in BT (other than those due to browser storage limits)\n- In addition to monthly and yearly subscriptions a one-time purchase lifetime license will be offered with pricing as follows:\n  - Monthly $1.33/mo, Yearly $10.66/yr, Lifetime $21\n  - This (low, low) pricing reflects my goal of having BT be widely used and to encourage users to support its development. The extra change over $1/$10/$20 covers the Stripe transaction costs.\n- License enforcement will be as follows:\n  - 30 days all access.\n  - After 30 days messages of gentle encouragement will be shown at intervals.\n  - Functionally some setting preferences will be locked (Dark mode, Favicons etc) but otherwise the app will be fully functional.\n\n# 0.9.9a\nThis was a minor point release because there are no changes requiring updates on the Web Stores, but it has some major functionality!\n\n## Local File Sync\nLocal file sync opens up a lot of potential for saving, versioning and backing up your BrainTool data. The file location used by BrainTool can be hooked up to DropBox, a git repository or any other cloud syncing mechanism.\n\nLocal sync is mutually exclusive with GDrive syncing, you can only sync to one place. Syncing can be turned on via the Settings screen (click the new Settings icon, top right). If you are already syncing to GDrive and want to change you will first need to turn off GDrive syncing (via 'Actions', again top right). On initiation you will be asked to select a folder for BT to access. The browser will ask you to grant permission first for Read-only access to the folder and then for read-write access.\n\nThe ability to write to a local file from a web app is a newish capability and heavily secured within the browser. Every time you re-open the BT Topic Manager you will need to re-grant permissions for BT to write to the local folder. Note that the **Brave** browser developers need to enable via a browser configuration setting.\n\n## Settings, Actions and Help panels\nThe previous overlay panel put access to settings behind multiple mouse clicks and was confusing for many users. We've broken out those functions into separate panels which can be accessed directly from the top level Topic Manager. Settings and Actions are top right, Help is bottom right. Other than Local file sync, the available settings and actions are unchanged.\n\n## Tips, Messages and Warnings\nA colored panel below the topic tree now shows any required informational messages on startup and subsequently provides access to a set of tips on BT usage. If a sync file is out of date the panel shows a 'Warning' message and provides a shortcut to the refresh function with a single click.\n\n## Minor UI changes\nIn addition to the above:\n- Some colors have been tweaked to improve contrast and readability.\n- The application as a whole now does a better job of handling wide and narrow Topic Manager windows.\n- The topic card editor makes better use of space and use a fixed width font to improve org-mode compatibility.\n\n## Telemetry\nWhile your privacy is a key aspect of the BrainTool value proposition and we do not have any access to your data, we do need to collect some information on how the application itself is being used. On startup the app now records (to Google Analytics) the number of saved topics and pages, the number of file saves/updates, the number of tab operations performed, the number of times you've launched the app, days since install and how long your last session of using it was.\n\n# Welcome to BrainTool 0.9.9\n## New Look and Feel including a Dark Mode\nI completely revamped the BT fonts and color palette and added a dark mode - the most requested feature.\n\n## Re-organized Saver Tool\nI made another iteration on whats been called the bookmarker or popup to make it easier to understand while keeping it fast and efficient for both mouse and keyboard users. Additionally, any number of nested new topics can now be created from the Saver e.g. setting the topic to Animal:Vertebrate:Mammal:Carnivore:Canid:Dog:Hound:Beagle will create 8 levels of topic if they don't already exist.\n\n## Compact Mode\nAnother highly requested feature. Shrinking the Topic Manager to less than 350 pixels wide hides the notes column for a highly compact and information dense display of your saved topics and pages.\n\n## \"Open in New Window\" Tool\nYou can now open a page, or complete topic, in a new window. The previous mapping of topics to windows has been removed as being too complicated. You can choose to have BT manage your tabs, grouping them into tab groups, or not, thus leaving them wherever you or the browser puts them. BT will no longer confuse you by moving tabs between windows.\n\n## \"Add Top Level Topic\" Tool\nAvailable at the top of the Topic Manager. Hopefully this one is self-explanatory.\n\n## Topic Manager window remembers its position\nThe Topic Manager now opens with the same size and position as it had when it was last closed.\n\n## GDrive Refresh Button\nIf you have GDrive syncing turned on, the Refresh button is now available in the top toolbar whenever BT detects that there is a newer file available.\n\n## Topic Tree imports\nA correctly formatted org-mode file will now import its contents into the appropriate nesting in the tree. See https://braintool.org/topicTrees.\n\n## Other Usability and Misc Improvements\nI removed the counter for number of saves (top right) because its no longer part of the pricing model. Lots of improvements were made in areas like the card editor, the initial topic tree, the initial placement of the topic manager etc.\n\n#  BrainTool 0.9.8\n## New Bookmarker\nTo make the 'popup' more usable I've re-designed it from the ground up and done some rebranding. I'm now calling the popup 'Bookmarker'. \n\n## Skip the Topic!\nBy popular demand I added a 'Scratch' topic.\n\n## Update existing note cards in the Bookmarker\nWith this new bookmarker design I was able to add the ability to edit the notes and title for existing saved pages.\n\n##Topic Manager can run in a tab\nBased on a suggestion from Crimson K and validation from Timothy, I added an option for the Topic Manager to run in a browser tab rather than the current side panel.\n\n## Performance Improvements\nThanks to Timothy for stressing BT with his six thousand plus bookmarks! A small tweak to avoid a low level recalculation of layout for every table row added resulted in a significant speed up on first start with a big braintool.org file. Search got similar performance attention and should now be snappier.\n\n## Search Improvements\nThanks to Peter for his detailed feedback on Search. Improvements include better key handling on Linux, being able to 'escape' key out of search, restoring previous selection on failed search and a few other bug fixes.\n\n## Space key\nAlso based on Peter's feedback, the space key will now open a tab for the selected item if its not already open, and highlight it if it is open.\n\n# Earlier releases\n\n## Support for Edge and Brave browsers\nEdge users can get BrainTool at the Edge store. Brave users can install from the Chrome store.\n## File Import/Export\nIn addition to Chrome Bookmarks, 0.9 adds the ability to import from a TabsOutliner export and also to import a text file with org-mode markup.\n## org-mode Support\nBrainTool should now retain any org markup in the BrainTool.org file (or an imported file).\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n## Ability to tag all a windows tabs at once\n## Statistics Bar",

Heading, paragraph text and contained http(s) links are extracted and represented in the tree. In addition to exporting to Bookmarks you can now also export an org file.\n\n## org-mode Support\nBrainTool should now retain any org markup in the BrainTool.org file (or an imported file). BT stores app data using headers for Topics, headers with links for topic occurrences (ie links) and paragraph text for notes. Other constructs such as lists, tables, blocks etc will just be shown in plain text in the tree and written back out as such. This allows BrainTool to become an integral part of a text and org-based note taking and productivity workflow.\n\n## No GDrive Dependency\nBy default BT now stores your data in Chrome local storage. This should be resilient across browser sessions on a single Chrome instance. Its still advisable to also write to the BrainTool.org file on your GDrive but not necessary. \n## Other Minor Improvements\n * New Keyboard commands - entering 1 through 9 now collapses the tree to the numbered level (e.g. hit '2' to show just the top two levels of the tree)\n * URLS of the form file:/// are now supported, type something like file:///users/tconfrey/Documents/ into Chrome's address bar and save it into your BT tree! \n * Tree folding and unfolding now has a slight animation to help maintain your bearings.\n * The popup now has some descriptive hover text and an explicit 'Save' button which does the same thing as just hitting Enter in the Notes field.\n\n# BrainTool 0.8\n## Support for Release Notes!\nHopefully you are seeing this page as a result of being upgraded to the new version of BrainTool. I also added a [Welcome](welcome.md) page for new installs, feel free to check it out. See also the general [Support](../support.md) page.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\nKey bindings were influenced by emacs/org-mode. Commands operating on the selection are as follows:\n  - Tree Navigation/Display:\n    - n, p or up/down arrow keys select the 'n'ext or 'p'revious row.\n    - Navigation with the right and left arrow functions to open and close nodes while navigating the tree.\n    - Tab expands or collapses the subtree for a Topic row.\n  - Browser Control:\n    - Space surfaces the selections' tab or window if it's open in the browser. (NB you also get this by double clicking a row.)\n    - Enter toggles open/close the selected links tab in the browser, or all of its tabs if its a Topic.\n  - Tree Editing:\n    - Opt-up/down arrows move the selection up/down.\n    - t cycles the TODO state.\n    - e opens the editor for the selection.\n    - Opt-left arrow outdents (promotes) the selection.\n    - delete deletes the selected topic or occurrence.\n    - Opt-enter creates a new child Topic.\n\nIn addition there are the following general keys:\n  - h Keyboard commands can be shown any time by typing 'h'.\n  - Opt-z undoes the last deletion. Note that previous versions of your BrainTool file are saved by Google on your GDrive.\n  - Opt-b opens the BrainTool popup on the current browser tab.\n  - Opt-b-b opens and selects the BrainTool side panel.\n\n## Ability to tag all a windows tabs at once\n\n## Statistics Bar\n  - Showing the topic's full parentage in the topic editor popup.\n  - Better pre-fills for the topic to use in the popup.\n  - Improvements to keeping tabs assigned to tab groups properly during navigation.\n\n# BrainTool 0.7\n- New grouping options were introduced. \n    - Window, as before one window per Topic. \n    - Tab Group - a tab group per Topic. \n    - None - no active grouping, tabs are created in place.\n- New Topic insert button. Add a sub topic under any topic.\n- Support for topics with no links to occurrences.\n- Updated icons. \n- The BT toolbar badge scrolls to show full tag name and shows notes on hover and in the popup (read-only).\n- double-tap option-b to surface BT window",

Lots of improvements were made in areas like the card editor, the initial topic tree, the initial placement of the topic manager etc.\n\n#  BrainTool 0.9.8\n## New Bookmarker \nTo address some confusion and to make the 'popup' more usable I've re-designed it from the ground up and done some rebranding. I'm now calling the popup 'Bookmarker'. Clicking the BT icon (or Opt/alt-b) now opens the Bookmarker showing the note card for the page with the Notes field selected. You can still just hit enter to move on without adding a note, for speed. This new card editor also allows you to edit the page title and it's where you can select to save all tabs or just the active one.\n\nOn exit the card editor opens the topic selector. This was also reworked to show a clearer view of your topic hierarchy. The hierarchy starts partially open and subtopics can be opened, closed and selected with your mouse. Auto complete works as before, just start typing. The previous 'Group', 'Stick', 'Close' options have been reduced to a selector for 'Group' or 'Close'. The selector remembers its start and defaults to that the next time around.\n\n## Skip the Topic!\nBy popular demand I added a 'Scratch' topic. If you leave the topic selector empty the page (or pages) will be added under the Scratch topic. This means you can save a page, or all pages in the window, by bringing up the Bookmarker and hitting Enter twice, the first creates the note card with an empty note, the second saves the page under Scratch.\n\n## Update existing note cards in the Bookmarker\nWith this new bookmarker design I was able to add the ability to edit the notes and title for existing saved pages. Opening the Bookmarker for a page already saved to BT will open it's note card and save any updates. (NB changing its topic still needs to be done in the Topic Manager.)\n\n## Side Panel is now Topic Manager and can run in a tab\nThe term 'Side Panel' did not make sense to folks so its been renamed to Topic Manager. Based on a suggestion from Crimson K and validation from Timothy, I added an option for the Topic Manager to run in a browser tab rather than the current side panel. Its not optimized for this form factor and for me it works better as a panel off to the side of my browser tabs but it seemed worth adding to support a full-page-on-top type setup. From Options, change 'Topic Manager in:' from 'Side Panel' to 'Tab', wait a few seconds for it to save, then close the Topic Manager. When you relaunch, the Topic Manager will open in a regular browser tab. If you use it in this mode I'd be interested in feedback over in the discussion group.\n\n## Performance Improvements\nThanks to Timothy for stressing BT with his six thousand plus bookmarks! A small tweak to avoid a low level recalculation of layout for every table row added resulted in a significant speed up on first start with a big braintool.org file. Search got similar performance attention and should now be snappier.\n\n## Search Improvements\nThanks to Peter for his detailed feedback on Search. Improvements include better key handling on Linux, being able to 'escape' key out of search, restoring previous selection on failed search and a few other bug fixes.\n\n## Space key\nAlso based on Peter's feedback, the space key will now open a tab for the selected item if its not already open, and highlight it if it is open.\n \n# BrainTool 0.9.7\n## Search\nSee the new User Guide for details, or just try playing with it and let me know what you think.\n\n## Best effort mapping of open tabs to saved links on startup\nWhen you first launch BrainTool it will attempt to find any tabs which you have already saved into your braintool.org file and show them as open in the tree.\n\n## Selection in tree now tracks highlighted tab in browser\nAs you navigate tabs in the browser any matching row in the BT tree will be selected (and scrolled into view).\n\n## Onboarding and usability updates\n- I trimmed the initial BrainTool.org file contents to be less overwhelming.\n- The initial first-click popup now explains the side panel and popup.\n- When the side panel is closed the popup icon now shows an indication that BT is not running.\n\n## Bug fixes \n- BT now saves correctly on keyboard number based folding and keyboard row moves. \n- Topic nodes with no links are now placed correctly in the hierarchy.\n- Better handling of Google Drive versioning should remove spurious warnings about a newer file version existing. \n- Tab navigation now works correctly on the topic card editor.\n\n## User Guide: see https://braintool.org/support/userGuide\n\n# BrainTool 0.9.6\n\n## Cleaner more minimal UI\nBased on the results of a comprehensive review by a panel of designers and UX folks I've moved to a cleaner more minimal UI with bigger buttons, more spacing and clearer backgrounds. \n\n## Improved onboarding process\nCombined with the general UI improvements I overhauled the installation and getting started process to try to address areas where new users were getting confused and to get them up and running with less effort.\n\n## Support for Edge and Brave browsers\nEdge users can get BrainTool at the Edge store. Brave users can install from the Chrome store. Unfortunately Firefox does not support the tab groups function BT needs and has other incompatibilities that made it too onerous for me to support it in this release. Vivaldi (installable via the Chrome store) works with Topic mapping set to 'Windows'.\n\n## Added support for subscription memberships and coupons\nIn advance of the 1.0 version of BrainTool I needed to put some structure in place to allow me to charge for premium subscriptions. See the in-app coupon offer!\n\n## Version warnings for synced Google Drive file\nIf you've chosen to sync to a Drive file BrainTool now checks before saving, and on getting focus, whether there's a more recent version than the one you are viewing and if so provides an alert (if saving) or warning.\n\n# BrainTool 0.9.1a\nUpdated Topic Card editor and navigation.\n\n# BrainTool 0.9\n\n## File Import/Export\nIn addition to Chrome Bookmarks, 0.9 adds the ability to import from a TabsOutliner export and also to import a text file with org-mode markup. Heading, paragraph text and contained http(s) links are extracted and represented in the tree. In addition to exporting to Bookmarks you can now also export an org file.\n\n## org-mode Support\nBrainTool should now retain any org markup in the BrainTool.org file (or an imported file). BT stores app data using headers for Topics, headers with links for topic occurrences (ie links) and paragraph text for notes. Other constructs such as lists, tables, blocks etc will just be shown in plain text in the tree and written back out as such. This allows BrainTool to become an integral part of a text and org-based note taking and productivity workflow.\n\n## No GDrive Dependency\nBy default BT now stores your data in Chrome local storage. This should be resilient across browser sessions on a single Chrome instance. Its still advisable to also write to the BrainTool.org file on your GDrive but not necessary. \n## Other Minor Improvements\n * New Keyboard commands - entering 1 through 9 now collapses the tree to the numbered level (e.g. hit '2' to show just the top two levels of the tree)\n * URLS of the form file:/// are now supported, type something like file:///users/tconfrey/Documents/ into Chrome's address bar and save it into your BT tree! \n * Tree folding and unfolding now has a slight animation to help maintain your bearings.\n * The popup now has some descriptive hover text and an explicit 'Save' button which does the same thing as just hitting Enter in the Notes field.\n\n# BrainTool 0.8\n## Support for Release Notes!\nHopefully you are seeing this page as a result of being upgraded to the new version of BrainTool. I also added a [Welcome](welcome.md) page for new installs, feel free to check it out. See also the general [Support](../support.md) page.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\nKey bindings were influenced by emacs/org-mode. Commands operating on the selection are as follows:\n  - Tree Navigation/Display:\n    - n, p or up/down arrow keys select the 'n'ext or 'p'revious row.\n    - Navigation with the right and left arrow functions to open and close nodes while navigating the tree.\n    - Tab expands or collapses the subtree for a Topic row.\n  - Browser Control:\n    - Space surfaces the selections' tab or window if it's open in the browser. (NB you also get this by double clicking a row.)\n    - Enter toggles open/close the selected links tab in the browser, or all of its tabs if its a Topic.\n  - Tree Editing:\n    - Opt-up/down arrows move the selection up/down.\n    - t cycles the TODO state.\n    - e opens the editor for the selection.\n    - Opt-left arrow outdents (promotes) the selection.\n    - delete deletes the selected topic or occurrence.\n    - Opt-enter creates a new child Topic.\n\nIn addition there are the following general keys:\n  - h Keyboard commands can be shown any time by typing 'h'.\n  - Opt-z undoes the last deletion. Note that previous versions of your BrainTool file are saved by Google on your GDrive.\n  - Opt-b opens the BrainTool popup on the current browser tab.\n  - Opt-b-b opens and selects the BrainTool side panel.\n\n## Ability to tag all a windows tabs at once\n\n## Statistics Bar\n  - Showing the topic's full parentage in the topic editor popup.\n  - Better pre-fills for the topic to use in the popup.\n  - Improvements to keeping tabs assigned to tab groups properly during navigation.\n\n# BrainTool 0.7\n- New grouping options were introduced. \n    - Window, as before one window per Topic. \n    - Tab Group - a tab group per Topic. \n    - None - no active grouping, tabs are created in place.\n- New Topic insert button.
