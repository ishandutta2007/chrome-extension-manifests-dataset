This extension works even if you are not logged in. Also, the user can insert a set of custom CSS rules to enhance the default theme. This extension does not run a persistent background script and only adds a few lines of code to each twitch page to be able to toggle the theme on and off.\n\nNotes: \n1. To add your own CSS rules visit the options page\n2. To disable the dark theme, simply click once on the toolbar button. You can enable the dark theme anytime later by pressing the button once more\n3. If you already have opened twitch.tv tabs after installation, you need to refresh them for the theme to get applied."
