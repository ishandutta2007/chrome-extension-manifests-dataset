How do costs of shipping and handling, as well as your purchase price affect your earnings? Find out with the eBay Fee Calculator and even see what it would take for the same sale to break even!\n\nWhat's more, this eBay Fee Calculator is famous for researching competitor pricing. For example, it is a valuable extension for retailers who want to see if they can get away with selling an item at the same price as their competitors. Simply enter your (or supplier's) details to see if it is profitable to sell at a similar price!\n\nTo use, visit an eBay item and open the extension to insert the item's price and item information automatically. If charging the buyer for shipping, you can include a shipping price as well.\n\nMost importantly, you can enter the cost you pay for the item and shipping, select which payment processor you'll be using (eBay Managed Payments or PayPal), and view how much profit you will collect from the sale.\n\nThe eBay calculator also has several features that allow you to quickly see how your fees will be affected with either PayPal or eBay Managed Payments. The custom-fee options give even more insight into what's happening with this calculation, and switching the payment option will apply default fee data for your selection!\n\nAfter entering your selling information, the middle panel on the plugin will display your total eBay and payment fees, a breakeven price, expenses, and profit."
