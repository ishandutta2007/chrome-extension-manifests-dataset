Learn the definition of common startup terms, along with case studies, as you open a new tab.\n\nTired of looking up “Top 100 startup terms every entrepreneur should know” before every investor meeting, or overwhelmed when talking to your founder friends? With Sip, gradually build up your glossary every time you open a new tab. One “sip” at a time.\n\nEvery term card comes with a randomly populated word, its definition in layman’s terms, and a small case study/example to demonstrate."
