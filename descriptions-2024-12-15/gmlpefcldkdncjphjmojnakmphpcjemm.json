The first (and the default) method is using the HTML5 Canvas API to upscale the images up to 10 times the original size. The Canvas API has a built-in interpolation method for pixel smoothing. The final result with the HTML5 method is somehow satisfactory but lacks some details and may not be sharp enough. Two other methods use artificial intelligence for upscaling. The first AI is client-side and uses UpscalerJS (https://github.com/thekevinscott/UpscalerJS) & TensorFlow (https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) libraries. The second AI is server-side and uses the ClipDrop API (https://clipdrop.co/apis/docs/super-resolution). Please read the privacy policy for this addon here (https://mybrowseraddon.com/privacy-policy/image-upscaler.html).\n\nNote 1: for the canvas method (default engine), the maximum upscale factor is 10x, for the client-side AI it is 8x, and server-side 4x. \n\nNote 2: for both AI methods, it is recommended to use small images as the upscaling process with artificial intelligence is computationally expensive. In server-side AI, an API key is needed; please read the instruction within the extension on how to get the API key.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the addon homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/image-upscaler.html)."
