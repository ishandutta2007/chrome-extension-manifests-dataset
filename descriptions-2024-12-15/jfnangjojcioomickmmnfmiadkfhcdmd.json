You can see the list of blocked domains on the options page. Moreover, you can edit this list to add or remove desired items.\n\nThe toolbar button serves as an ON|OFF switch. Badge icon color will also change to adapt itself to the new state. The red icon is when the addon is active and the Grey icon is for the inactive state. When you are browsing the internet, the addon constantly monitors websites for containing crypto-coin miming third-party domains. Once a URL is detected, it instantly blocks it from loading in your browser. This way, no website can use your computer resources to mine digital currencies.\n\nNote: to report bugs, please fill the bug report form on the addon homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/block-miners.html)."
