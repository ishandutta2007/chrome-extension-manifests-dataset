This extension displays information from MyAnimeList when you hover over an anime link. Simply hover over the http://myanimelist.net link on any webpage and a helpful popup will appear displaying information about the anime/manga.\n\nThis is also helpful for those who have tons of anime on their Plan to Watch list and can't remember what each of them was about. Now instead of painfully clicking through each one of them, simply hover over them and refresh your memory with the image and description.\n\nOn top of the information this extension displays, you can also add anime/manga to your Plan to Watch/Read list, straight from the popup!\n\nFirefox version:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mal-hoverinfo/\n\nSource code:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/Rivenation/mal-hoverinfo/"
