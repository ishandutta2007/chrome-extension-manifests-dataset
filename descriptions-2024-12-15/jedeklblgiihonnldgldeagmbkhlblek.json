Most of the extensions block the entire feed and hide all recommendations which might not be what you want while studying or focusing on learning a topic. By selectively blocking the distracting videos only, this extension allows you to focus on what's important and prevents you from getting distracted into the YouTube rabbithole.\n\nThe extension currently works in 3 scenarios within YouTube:\n- Home Feed\n- Search Results\n- Video player and its accompanying recommendation column"
