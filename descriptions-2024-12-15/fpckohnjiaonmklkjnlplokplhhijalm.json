The development of virtual workplace and e-learning technologies means that now more than ever, families are sharing devices. However, adults don’t want their kids to see the content of their searches, especially if the topics are not appropriate for minors. There is a great need to segregate Internet browsing activities between their children and themselves, while they share the same device and same browser.\n\nAfter the extension has been added to your Chrome browser and activated for the first time, the parent user is instructed to create and customize the two profiles. \n\nAs a parent and adult user, you will be given the opportunity to enter your birth year and set your profile password once the extension has been activated for the first time. Your password prevents your kids from switching to your profile and potentially being exposed to inappropriate content. Therefore, we strongly recommend the use of a password. \n\nInside the children’s profile, we support Kiddle (default), KidRex, Kid’s Search, and Safe Search Kids. They help filter out inappropriate content and present your kids with an easy-to-use and safe environment. \n\nInside the parents’ profile, we support Yahoo, Google, Bing, Yandex, and Baidu. \n\nPermissions used and reasons:\n\n1.

We require this permission to change your default search engine to our domain search.privatesearch.online, powered by Yahoo, as a placeholder in order to provide you the functionalities of the extension. You can make a change at any time to other supported options inside the extension Settings.\n\nHow to remove this extension?\n\nIf you want to remove our extension, go to “Settings” on Chrome, and find our extension in the “Extensions” tab.
