TIM does this in a coordinated way by allowing the meeting organizer to create and control a clock that both measures and manages speaking slots. The clock can be distributed to run on every participant's desktop, but is always controlled and synced to the organizer's clock.\nTIM makes meetings much more efficient, saves huge amounts of time (and money) and helps people stay focused. It disciplines undisciplined speakers and continued use will encourage people to prepare for meetings and show respect for everyone else's time.\nRemember one undisciplined presenter talking to himself for 30 mins wastes half an hour of his time, when talking to a group of 20, 10 person hours are wasted, that is more than a full working day!"
