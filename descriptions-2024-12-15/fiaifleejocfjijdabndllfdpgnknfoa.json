This extension just opens a URL from my own website in a new window allowing you to search the Roatan MLS for available properties in the Honduras department of Islas de Bahia. It asks you to refresh before proceeding. It is just a convenience so that they can click an icon rather than having to visit my site and then go through several layers of menus.\nIf you use your name and email to login you can have my site email you your preferred search criteria at regular intervals.\nFor further information relocating and purchasing property on Roatan please feel free to contact me through my website or via WhatsApp using the help link. You can also joint the Facebook group called Life on Roatan where I answer your question or buy the book from Amazon."
