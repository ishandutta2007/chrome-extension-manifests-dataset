Add as many Folders as you want to a Collection. Give Collections, Folders and Tabs an expressive Name.\nAdd Columns to Tabs or delete them if you no longer need them.\n\nAdd a Note to each Bookmark. To provide a better Overview, decide if the Url, the Note or the Date of the Bookmark is visible.\n\nCut and paste folders from one Collection to another with an easy to use GUI.

An Html Screenshot is like the Website itself without Scripts.\nAn Image Screenshot is like a Photo of a complete Website. Add Textfields to Screenshots and scroll to each Text Field with \none click.\n\nAll Collections, Columns and Tabs can be stored as a Bookmarkset in the Cloud or on a local Storage Device like your Harddrive or\nUSB-Stick. This makes it easy to share Bookmarksets across different Browsers.\n\nIt's possible to create up to 30 Bookmarksets inside one Browser. Switch between Bookmarksets in the Sidebar of Tabflownotes. \n\nA Popup Window makes it easy to add Bookmarks to the active Bookmarkset. Just follow the Tooltip to see where you can add Bookmarks."
