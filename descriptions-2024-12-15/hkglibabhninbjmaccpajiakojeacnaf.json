We're constantly building new tools to empower our journalists to discover amazing content that newsrooms, brands and  video producers can quickly turn to their advantage. One of these tools, which we're sharing with the world is our Multisearch extension.\n\nIt's a simple solution for a simple problem. Often a news story or trend breaks on one social platform and  quickly spreads to others. The Multisearch extension helps you quickly query keywords across Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram and Spokeo, in the comfort of your own browser.\n\nSimply click on the extension, enter in your search term and the extension will open up new tabs for each social network showing the the search results in each.\n\nPlease also note that this extension uses Heap Analytics for general usage statistics. Storyful only tracks how many searches are being performed and never what you are searching for."
