How to enable: after installing the extension, head over to chrome://settings/languages then add English (UK), and check the \"UK extended\" option. If the option does not show up, sign out once and retry the procedure. Switch keyboard layouts with Alt+Shift until you hit the UK extended keyboard (symbol: EN*).\n\nThis extension also provides a NZ English IME (macron accent available with right-alt+vowel), as well as a Te Reo IME.\n\nBy installing this item, you agree to the Google Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/.\n\nKnown issue: if this stopped working after updating to M36 please see crbug.com/397143 for a workaround (Chrome OS 37+ should not be affected)\n\nV1.1: fixed the \"not working as advertised issue\" (the internal name of the key changed in Chrome OS)\n\nV2.0: Add NZ English and Te Reo"
