It ranks the scholars based on metrics (e.g. h-index, citations) that have limited applicability. AOSSIE Scholar provides a wide variety of alternative academic performance metrics that may provide a more holistic and more detailed view of a scholar’s academic contributions. It scraps data from the Google Scholar page of a scholar and then opens a new page showing various other metrics and charts for the scholar."
