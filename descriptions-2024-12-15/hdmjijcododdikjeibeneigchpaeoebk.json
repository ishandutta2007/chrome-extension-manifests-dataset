Do you frequently watch status from your friends or family? Sometimes you liked those and want to put it on your own status?\n\nWhat do you do in this situation? You ask them to send that video to you then only you can put it on your status. Right? \n\nSo here we are removing that restriction which allows you to dowload any photo or video from status with just one click. \n\nPlease watch the demo video for better understanding. Just add it to your browser and tap on the icon it will automatically download and save it in your local device.\n\nIf you want to contribute to this project.
