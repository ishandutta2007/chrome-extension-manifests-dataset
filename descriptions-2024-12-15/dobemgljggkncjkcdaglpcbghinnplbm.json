Planning Poker provides a gaming-like experience for estimating your stories but only allows direct integration with Jira. All other tools can only integrate using a .CSV upload. Pivotal Tracker does allow exporting data via .CSV but then the user must manually go in and make the adjustments to get it into the format that Planning Poker requires for import.\n\nThis is where this tool comes in handy! You will provide your API Key and Project ID and can then retrieve a list of stories from your Pivotal Tracker project that will be pre-formatted into a format that Planning Poker will accept. You can simply copy/paste the output and save it as a .CSV and then upload that file into Planning Poker with a few clicks!"
