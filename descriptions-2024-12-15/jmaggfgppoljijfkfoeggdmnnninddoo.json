But moving into details, you will see opened websites are also indented by url directories.\n\nFor regularly visited urls, it is very easy to pin or unpin them on Decker's widget.\n\nThe Decker widget can be toggled by the round button floating on the page. You can drag this button everywhere on any website pages. If you see it annoying on some website like Google Maps, you can hide this small button, there is a setting for it on Decker extension's popup."
