There are three rules:\n- Set a different background color for each log group of AWS Lambda invocation. Therefore, you can easily recognize beginning, body and end of the logs of the same invocation.\n- Set font weight of lines having `REPORT`, `[ERROR]` and `[Error ` keywords to bold.\n- Set text color of ANSI terminal codes in the logs. (by https://github.com/oguimbal)\n\nFurther, there is two functionality for better log viewing experience (by https://github.com/oguimbal):\n- Switching to fullscreen,\n- Refreshing the logs periodically to load new items.\n\nThis extension doesn't collect any user and web page information. It only runs on AWS CloudWatch Logs web page. It is free to use.\n\nOverhead is very low, colorize operation takes ~7 milliseconds, listen operation for new event logs takes just ~0.5 milliseconds in every second.\n\nContributions are welcome. To contribute please visit project page: https://github.com/ilhan-mstf/colorize_cloudwatch_logs\n\nRelease Log:\n--------------------\nVersion 0.5.1:\n- Enable font override on new ui\n\nVersion 0.5.0:\n- Handle new ui\n- Case insensitive error line search\n\nVersion 0.4.11:\n- Add `[Error ` as a special line to make it bold\n- Add \"Fullscreen\" and \"Follow tail\" buttons\n\nVersion 0.3.8:\n- Set text color of ANSI terminal codes\n- Update extension logo\n- Improve performance\n\nVersion 0.2.1:\n- Make bold font weight of `REPORT` and `[ERROR]` lines"
