Help out your fellow developer based on what you’ve learned from the pitfalls of the bad documentation. Each edit/note displays the user who contributed the edit along with their Stack Overflow’s reputation so the user can discern which edits/notes to consider.\n\nPrivate Edits & Notes Locally or Across Computers\nSave personal edits and notes on your local computer or across any computer where the this browser extension is installed. Whenever you return to that webpage, all your edits and notes are displayed immediately on the website.\n\nSee Tracked Changes\nSee the changes that were made with the click of a button. Easily distinguish what was added or removed.\n\nView Original Text\nDon’t like any of the edits, no problem. Easily switch between personal edits, community edits, and yes, the original text."
