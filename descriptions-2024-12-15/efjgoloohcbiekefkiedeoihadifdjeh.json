After setting the filters like you normally would on one page, you can save the filter settings with this extension.  Once the filters are saved they will automatically be applied to any BoardGameGeek Market page.\n\nJust open the extension's popup window and select the filters that you want to apply to future Geek Market visits and click on save. The filters that you are most likely to want will be pre-selected for you, but \"objecttype\", \"objectid\", and \"pageid\" are still available in case you want those too.\n\nIf you no longer want the extension to apply filters, just open the extension's popup, clear all of the checkboxes and click on save.\n\nA slightly more technical description: This extension captures all of the query string parameters from the request url. Then adds the query string parameters that the user saves to future requests."
