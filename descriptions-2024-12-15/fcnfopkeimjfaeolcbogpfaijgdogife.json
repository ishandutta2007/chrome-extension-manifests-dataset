In less than 10 seconds MusicMate will permanently remove the hassle of concert-hunting and let you relax and enjoy the music instead.\n\nSimply log in with your Spotify account, enter your location, and the distance you're willing to travel for a concert and you're good to go!\n\nIf the app detects that your currently listened artist is performing nearby you'll get a notification. You won't even have to search for tickets. View them by clicking on the \"Show tickets\" button in the notification or on the artist thumbnail in your recent discoveries. If you're in a rush, you can set a next-day reminder.\n\nIt's completely free and works even if you're listening to Spotify on your smartphone! No more missed chances. Save your time, energy, and money and let the performances find you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nBy using this add-on, you agree to the musicMate privacy policy available at https://the-fun-place.vercel.app/musicMate/privacy-policy\n\nCredits:\nCompass icon made by https://www.flaticon.com/authors/madebyoliver﻿ from www.flaticon.com\nDistance icon made by https://www.flaticon.com/authors/vectors-market﻿ from www.flaticon.com\nAlarm clock icon made by https://www.flaticon.com/authors/madebyoliver﻿ from www.flaticon.com\nTickets icon made by https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik from www.flaticon.com\nKitty icon made by https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik from www.flaticon.com"
