Its 4 colors are: green üü¢ (Trust List), orange üü† (warning), red üî¥ (Block List), and black ‚ö´Ô∏è (unknown security status). Clicking the paw shows helpful security and crypto information about the current website. Blocki works with Chromium-based browsers including: Chrome, Brave, Edge, Yandex, and Opera. The Firefox version will be available soon.\n\nüîú The first DEX/memecoin charting tool will be available in Version 1.0.0!\n\nüîí Never spies on which websites you visit. The Trust List and Block List are both automatically downloaded inside the extension every ~6 hours. In fact, Blocki's protection will work exactly the same if your internet is turned off.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Premium WatchCat URLs are scanned daily for security issues and show a special star in the paw menu. Visit tryblocki.com/watchcat-websites to learn more, verify a WatchCat URL, or add your website to the WatchCat list.\n\nüò∫ Persik PussyCat is the \"Wallet WatchCat\" mascot and powers Blocki with his PERSIK tokens (jettons) on TON chain. You can win prizes and unlock features by simply trying the extension & hodling PERSIK tokens (after Persik launches) or TON tokens (before Persik launches). Paste your TON chain wallet address into the settings page to automatically be entered into giveaways.
