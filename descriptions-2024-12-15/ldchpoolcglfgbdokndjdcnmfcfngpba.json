Think of a patch as an evolved hyperlink that can take you to a specific piece of information on a page, along with a note left behind by the sender. No more scrolling around to find a piece of information that a sender is referencing.\n\nThen, you can easily respond to patches with our in-browser chat window, so you never have to leave your workflow to conversate with friends or co-workers again.\n\nTrying to share a patch with someone without the extension? No problem.  Just choose to email them your patch instead. Your patch will be sent to them along with an invite to join you on Patchwork. \n\nWe strive to make sharing on the web faster and more fun than ever before. \n\nWe hope you like patching as much as we do! :)\n\nEnjoy! \n\n-Patch Team"
