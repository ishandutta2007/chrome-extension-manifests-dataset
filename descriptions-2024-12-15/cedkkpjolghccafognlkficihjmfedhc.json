Your text will be encrypted as ciphertext with Stanford Javascript Crypto Library (http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/).\n\n> SJCL is secure. It uses the industry-standard AES algorithm at 128, 192 or 256 bits; the SHA256 hash function; the HMAC authentication code; the PBKDF2 password strengthener; and the CCM and OCB authenticated-encryption modes. Just as importantly, the default parameters are sensible: SJCL strengthens your passwords by a factor of 1000 and salts them to protect against rainbow tables, and it authenticates every message it sends to prevent it from being modified. \n\n**WARNING**: If you don't remember the password, you will lose all the information on that encrypted note!!!** It's strongly recommended to use password hints as labels or add them to the title of your encrypted notes.\n\nAndroid and iOS: \nCurrently the Chrome mobile app doesn't support extensions. In order to decrypt your notes, you have to install the Tampermonkey script on your phone and use the Google Keep website on mobile browsers.
