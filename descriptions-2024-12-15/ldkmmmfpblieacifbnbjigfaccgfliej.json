Go to the Ultimate Guitar site, you can see the green Spotify icon at the lower right corner like in the picture.\n2. Once you clicked it, you'll redirected to the Spotify log-in page\n3. After you're done logging in, you'll see the icon changed into the UG-Spotify fusion icon. Then when you play any song on the Spotify, you can click the icon, and the tool will take you to the top search result of song (if it exists).\n\nNote:\nThis only works best for the pro user, because It chooses the first tab on the search list so that it might be the official one."
