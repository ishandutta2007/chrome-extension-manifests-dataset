Think of it as the friend who can't help but tidy up your place when they visit. It creates a neat little pattern with your windows - plus, it's smart enough to consider your screen size and orientation, making sure every window fits just right, every time.\n\nWHAT IT DOES\n\n- Automatically tiles your windows when they are created or closed.\n- Thoughtfully tiles your windows taking into account your display resolution, orientation, and preferences.\n- Reserves a spot for a fixed size master window in a size ratio that suits your style.\n- Select a window spacing or choose to have none at all.\n- Toggle auto-tiling on/off.\n- Manually tiling works independently on different displays.\n\nUSAGE\n\nOnce Quilt is installed, it'll get straight to work, tiling your new browser windows to fit your screen just right. Click the extension icon to tweak preferences or to turn off the automatic tiling."
