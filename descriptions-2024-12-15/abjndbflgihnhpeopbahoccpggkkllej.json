Attention on your screen takes your attention off your natural breath, causing you to take short and shallow breaths, or even pause breathing when working on their computers.\n\nHello, Mouthbreather is here to help you refocus your breath. Serving as a reminder to take slow, long breaths through your nose, set yourself up for nose breathing success with custom interval reminders to shut your mouth.\n\nNamaste!"
