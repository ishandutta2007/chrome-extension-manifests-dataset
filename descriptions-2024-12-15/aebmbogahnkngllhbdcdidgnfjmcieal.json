This patch makes the summarise and download of the advanced search table work again.\n\nUpdated 05/10/2024 Now defaults the to date and from date in the advanced search. By default it uses the current date and three weeks ago. Also auto sorts the table based on attendance when you click summarise.\n\nUpdated 17/02/2023 Changed the name layout on starfish to take account of the pronouns being included. Also you can now click on either the initials or the name part and it will copy it to the clipboard. You don't need to copy paste anymore.\n\nUpdated 20/10/2022 removed some files that were there for debugging. Adding the ability to link from SAM to Starfish by student number. Changed the layout of the student name to be easy to copy paste and be clear.\n\nUpdated 17/10/2022 added an interactive table for the programme search. You can filer/sort the results then download as an excel spreadsheet.\n\nUpdated 10/02/2020 add a download as CSV option so you can download a spreadsheet view of the table.\n\nUpdated for changed to SAM as of 09/10/2019 so that it auto selects email address for you.\n\nUpdated for the changes to SAM as of 2/1/2015.\n\nUpdate - added an option to email the personal tutors of absent students for a given session. There isn't an easy way to pull the personal tutors email address from SAM (utill SAM gets updated) so you'll have to look that up yourself (sorry).\n\nInstructions\n============\n\nYou should use SAM via the Update attendance link within MyUCLan, search for the module you are interested in. Select the week and event you are interested in. This extension will have already selected that Network ID needs to be displayed, you should leave this selected, you can add other options if needed. Click View Register.\n\nYou will be presented with a list of students. A 'Mail absent' link should appear at the bottom of the student list. It is made up from the students that have a status of Abs in the column that can be edited. If you update a student's attendance status then you must submit the update before clicking on the Mail absent link.\n\nWhen you click on the link it should open your email client with the BCC field filled in containing the student that were absent from the session."
