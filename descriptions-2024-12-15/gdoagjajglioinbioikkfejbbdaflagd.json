Using the extension, the organization can monitor and restrict access to certain blacklisted web sites. Some of the data that is collected by the extension would include logged in user, URL accessed, title of the web page and event occurrence log. This information will be used by the organization to effectively control the employee on-line work behavior during scheduled work hours and protect exposure of business data.\n\n\n\nAbout the platform\n\n\nSentinel.AI Vision | Real-Time Monitoring – Dynamic webcam image analysis allows for real-time, ongoing authentication of remote staff based on Al-driven anomaly detection. It can flag objects of interest like a phone or additional faces that fall within the range of webcam. The solution includes instantiations reporting of detected anomalies to the supervisor for taking corrective action, additionally employees can themselves verify the captured anomalies and make correction to their seating position or ambient lighting.\n\n\nSentinel.AI Shield | Data PII masking – Instant data masking on web applications based on client’s security and privacy needs. Fields of information can be partially masked, and even completely masked without any change made to the host application as all masking takes place in the end point (Users browser). This is made possible by Robility Connect browser extension which will take care of the data making duties without any middleware systems.\n\n\nKey Features\n\n-Simple user on-boarding – Users must go through a 15-minute orientation course to get Sentinel.AI Remote worker certified.\n-In-app anomaly preview – Uses can review the captured anomalies and take corrective action instead of relaying on the supervisors to recommend corrective action.\n-Non-Invasive – No popups or banners to prevent users from focusing on the work at hand.\n-Email Alert – Periodic anomaly alerting system so supervisors can check anomalies without having to login to the platform.\n-Live status – Supervisors can instantly get to the number of users online at any given time.\n-Auto Update – The software has capability to automatically update itself, so it has the latest stable build with all the fixes that are made available periodically.\n-Remote Logging – In event of failure to report status for a user, the application proactively pushed the log to the platform so technical support team can do an RCA without disrupting agents work.\n\nTrue Value\n\nWith Sentinel.AI customers can be at peace knowing that they have enterprise grade of security in place for agents processing critical and sensitive transaction from home without having to worry about any lapses in security. \n\nSentinel.AI can offer holistic cost saving when considering the infrastructure, transportation, and administration costs of running a full-fledged brick-and-mortar facility. Now considering the cost for implementing Sentinel.AI being a Windows 10 Machine with webcam at $9 USD per month to on-board a user is miniscule compared to the former.\n\nInstead of providing blanket cover for support agents of various programs and processes, organizations can pick and choose the appropriate Sentinel.AI module depending of the type of data and level of security that is required for the process. \n\n\nDifferentiators\n\n-Completely transparent anomaly reporting where you get direct access to the anomaly with time stamp.\n-All in one Security suit where organizations can decide to turn on or off modules depending on where the employee is working out of either home or office. This is especially useful in hybrid work environments.\n-Access to anomaly data for a duration of 90 days, useful when security audits performed.\n-Built in team management system allowing platform managers to re-map supervisors or consultants when they move to support different processes.\n-One click face-training system which intuitively guides user to record facial orientation."
