Upon hoovering over the identified VAT string, a summary of company info and financial data is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. There are 4 blocks of information available: general company info, summary balance sheet info, a graph with financial performance and a list of directors. Each block can be set ON or OFF. The extension has also on itself a ON/OFF switch so it does not delay performance on pages where it is not relevant (such as e.g. LinkedIn pages). The resolution of the image can be adapted to the screen resolution. Rapunzel attaches a link to the identified string which -upon clicking- leads you to a detailed company information page at the Finactum site."
