If it’s enabled, chances are that someone has access over your account. When you deposit items to Mannco.store, Mannco.store will send you a trade request. What the Hijacker does is, he cancels that trade, he makes a new trade, accepts that trade and waits for you to accept it on your Mobile Authenticator.\n- When it detects that your API Key is enabled, a warning will pop-up when you try to deposit items to Mannco.store, and it will ask you to first remove the API Key before you’re able to deposit.\n\nWhy has it been made?\n- We’ve seen to many of our customers being scammed by a hijacker who has control over their Steam Account which is totally unneccesary. This extension will make sure you won’t get scammed while depositting your items to Mannco.store.\n\nWith the use of this extension, the Mannco.store Team wishes you a safe stay at https://mannco.store/!"
