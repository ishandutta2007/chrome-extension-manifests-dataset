By default this happens by pressing Ctrl+Y for going back in time and Ctrl+Shift+Y for the other way round. \n\n*** IMPORTANT TO KNOW ***\nUnfortunately Chrome doesn't drectly allow users to set Ctr+Tab as shortcut keys. So I suggest using the following trick to circumvent this: https://superuser.com/a/1326712.\n*** *** ***\n\nTab switching also works on special pages (like chrome://), Chrome Web Store URLs, PDFs, XMLs or when the address bar is focused. In this case a temporary tab is opened to show the menu.\nTo directly jump to a tab listed on the switcher menu, click on its title or icon.\n\nDrawbacks:\n- At the moment I don't have an idea how to avoid the temporary tab. It's required because I otherwise could not detect the release of the ctrl key (=end of the switching action) on special pages.\n- If you release the ctrl key too fast while the temporary tab is loaded I am unable to detect the key-up event, therefore the menu gets stuck. Please hit the ctrl key again to finish switching.\n- Recent tab order is not preserved when closing and restoring a window.\n\nPermissions:\n- 'Access your data on all websites': required to draw the tab list on top of the websites' content and to detect PDFs and XMLs.\n- 'Access your tabs and browsing activity': required to record tab order, open the temporary tab and to switch to the selected tab.\n\nUpdates:\n- 0.9\n-- switch to Manifest V3 to be future proof\n- 0.6\n-- tab titles on the switcher popup are now clickable to directly jump to a tab\n-- no more need to reload the tabs after initial install\n-- added xml viewer support (menu is shown on temporary tab)\n\n- 0.5\n-- added frameset support (menu is shown on temporary tab)\n\n- 0.4.2\n-- added support for ftp and file:// pages\n-- added incognito support\n\n- 0.3.1\n-- corrected tab order for tabs opened in the background\n-- refined stylesheet"
