If they are an existing affiliate, give them the proper promotion to match their traffic for the page.\n\nIf they are a new affiliate, you will be educated and can match a specific offer for their content and win them over with your knowledge.\n\nRun a search of your brand on an affiliate’s website to see if they are promoting you on their site or not. If not, reach out; you can see where you are or are not promoted by the affiliate.\n\nQuickly and easily take screenshots of a whole webpage, visible part of the page, or a selection on a page. Download or copy and paste for communication with affiliates or within your marketing team.\n\nMonitor and Track - If you have an affiliate deal on a selected page or position on an affiliate site, you can track when the promotion is changed out. Monitoring ensures the affiliate is running the promotion as requested.\n\nAlternatively, you can monitor other brands’ promotions or offers to see which brands get the prime positions on the affiliate’s site.\n\nBookmark Affiliate Sites - Create lists of affiliate sites that are or are not promoting you so you can easily follow them up to get you added or know that you are on the site already."
