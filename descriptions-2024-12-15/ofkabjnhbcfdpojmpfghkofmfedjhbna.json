It is compatible only with Gmail / Google Inbox. Make sure you are signed into Chrome using the same Google account for the Gmail inbox you wish to filter. \n\nAs the extension opens each link to unsubscribe, please ensure that you actually unsubscribed in full by manually checking each tab. While many links immediately unsubscribe you, some may have extra steps that unsub.ME does not currently account for.  Lastly, it is not recommended to process more than 15 links at a time unless your device has substantial processing power.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to my brother, Andrew, for answering all my coding questions and his major contributions to this project.\n\nSoon-to-be Features:\n• Increase success rate of unsubscribing on new tab open\n• Increase scope of links that can be grabbed from the user's  inbox\n• Select just 10 links when popup window is initialized"
