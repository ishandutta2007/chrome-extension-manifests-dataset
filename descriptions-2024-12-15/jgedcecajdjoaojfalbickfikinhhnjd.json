If such surprises would be unwelcome, the extension can easily be turned off and on by pressing on its icon on the upper left corner of your chrome window. \n\nNone of your data or records of any of your actions within the game will ever be sent off of your computer.\n\n---\nAn Experience is made and maintained by Todd Anderson for his MFA Thesis in Digital Language Arts at Brown University.\n\nThis extension aims to explore chrome extensions as a creative form, and to test their capacity for gameplay and narrative. It is not, like many other chrome extensions, a simple tool to accomplish a simple task, but it is designed to build a single coherent world and to tell a story within that world. I hope you enjoy it."
