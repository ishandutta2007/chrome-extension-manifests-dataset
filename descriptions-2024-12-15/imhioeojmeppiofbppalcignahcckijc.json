You can see the code on here on GitHub: https://github.com/balduvian/ebetshot.\n\nAll videos on websites you visit will have a little camera  button added in the top right corner. Clicking it will instantly save the current frame of the video to your clipboard.\n\nPinning Ebetshot to your extensions toolbar allows you to access the settings dropdown. You may choose to show or hide the screenshot button and change the output size of your screenshots. It is recommended to choose a small output size if you will be pasting the screenshots into Anki.\n\nOn websites where there are anti-screenshot measures in place or where videos are hosted cross-site, Ebetshot uses screen recording to screenshot. If Ebetshot asks to record your screen, please select \"Chrome Tab,\" then find the current tab in the screen share popup.\n\nEbetshot is only tested on Youtube and Netflix. It may not work as well on other sites."
