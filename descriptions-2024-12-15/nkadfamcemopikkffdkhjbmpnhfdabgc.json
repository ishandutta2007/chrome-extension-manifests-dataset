By changing the gameweek currently being viewed, the fixtures displayed under each player in your team will update to give managers an idea of how well their teams are setup for gameweeks to come (see images 1 & 2 above).\n\nClicking the Upcoming Fixtures icon in the Chrome toolbar loads a fixture table that shows managers the next 5 fixtures for all Premier League teams. (see image 3 above).\n\nNew in v4.1.0:\n\n- The fixture table in the Chrome toolbar can now be sorted by fixture difficulty rating (FDR), making it easier to spot the teams with an easier run of fixtures ahead when planning transfers.\n\n- The fixture difficulty rating (FDR) used in the fixture table can now be fully customised for each team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: To ensure this extension works as expected, please disable other FPL related extensions before using Upcoming Fixtures."
