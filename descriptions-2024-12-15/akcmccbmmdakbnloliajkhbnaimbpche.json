Activate the guard by inspecting the browser window (\"inspect element\") and visit the newly created Refresh Guard tab from the devtools window.\n\nNotes:\n\n    - This guard will only apply to the current page / browser window being inspected.\n    - If you attempt to navigate or refresh, the browser will display a generic dialog popup.\n        - Select \"Leave\" or \"Refresh\" to disable the Refresh Guard and again allow all navigation and refresh to occur.\n        - Select \"Cancel\" to block the navigation or refresh, which will keep you on the current page.\n\nThis extension is very basic and works well for simple use cases, such as:\n\n    UI Development and making local, ephemeral modifications to the current window in chrome devtools\n    Don't like websites/ other extensions auto navigating you away in general\n\nRoadmap to Somewhere:\n\n    - Enable from status bar button instead of only devtools tab (help wanted)\n    - Prevent popstate or SPA route changes that don't trigger a navigation (help wanted)"
