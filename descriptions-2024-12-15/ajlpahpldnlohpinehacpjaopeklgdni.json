Testers create reports with links to various test environments. If you want to click this link and go directly to the same address but with one of your local hosts/domains instead - here is an extension for you.\n\nRight-click any link or current page to visit the same URL, but with host replaced by one of your local hosts. It is a 1-click shortcut from browsing any page on CI environment to browsing the same URL on your environment. No need to copy, paste, replace host, make typo, fix typo on links from bug reports.\n\nChanges in 0.0.3:\n* user can specify more than one local URL.\n\nIcons made by \"Pixel perfect\" from www.flaticon.com"
