As you scroll through your feed, ads will be highlighted as they appear. To see information about how many ads have been loaded into the feed, the ratio of ads to organic posts and the position of each ad in the feed, click on the extension's icon to the right of the browser's menu bar, which will open a popup window. You can leave the window open as you scroll further down the feed and click the refresh button to see updated information."
