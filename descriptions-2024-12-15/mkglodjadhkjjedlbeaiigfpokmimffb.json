You hate when you don’t know, but leadership loves asking it. It’s tough because buyers themselves don’t always know.\n\nSo you guess who the right people are. Guessing can work, but it’s frustrating. It takes time. Accountstory fixes that. Here’s how.\n\nGET INSIGHTS INTO YOUR ACCOUNTS\n\nAccountstory helps you map out your target accounts. Are you talking to a true decision maker? Do you know the influencers or champions on the team you’re selling to? How does procurement make decisions?\n\nWe’ve crowdsourced answers to those questions from sales reps who’ve been there. And we've identified over 800,000 verified decision makers, champions, and influencers - growing week over week. Accountstory is more than an email finder. It's the ultimate sales prospecting tool to save you time \n\nNOT JUST CONTACT DATA\n\nThis is NOT just an email address and a name. This is context. We're surfacing the RIGHT people to work with. Sellers that have worked these accounts have verified the involvement of these decision makers and influencers. \n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n- Click on the Accountstory icon on Chrome while you’re on a company or profile page on LinkedIn.\n \n- If you’re on a profile, you can see details about a person like whether they influence deals or whether they sign them. You can also see what tools they make decisions about. Every stakeholder we've identified has actually been on the buying committee in a deal. \n\n- On a company page, you can see the full list of stakeholders and org charts/accounts maps for the accounts. \n\n- Get email addresses on LinkedIn for all our verified decision makers. \n\nLEARN MORE\n\nInstall Accountstory for Chrome for FREE!
