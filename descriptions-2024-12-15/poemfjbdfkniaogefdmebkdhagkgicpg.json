Once the popup widow opens, it will access the bookmarks already saved to your browser and then display for search within the pop window. Users will then be able to easily click out to their desired website (opens in a new tab). Dewey was created to help users find their saved bookmarks fast!\n\nDewey does not collect, save, or send any data. It simply accesses the bookmarks already saved to your browser and returns a neat interface that is easier to search than looking through your bookmark folder hierarchy."
