It tries to gather as much information as possible about your video, so it knows where to rank it and who to recommend it to.\n\nThe thing is: it's harder to know what videos are about, compared to text. By adding a transcript to your video, you're giving YouTube more (easily processed) information. With transcripts, YouTube will know what you're talking about in your video.\n\nThe more YouTube knows, the more accurate their recommendations. That means they'll show your video to the right audience- which means a higher CTR and average view duration for your videos.\n\nBetter Analytics for you, and more satisfied viewers for YouTube."
