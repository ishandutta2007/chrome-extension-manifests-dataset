This information can include a school-provided user ID, the time of day, and information about the domain and web site. The Chrome extension only collects information about domains associated with apps or sites in the LearnPlatform product library. The product library has been built over 5 years, and contains just under 6,000 products and related web sites identified by our school and district clients.\n\nThe information collected via the Chrome extension is never used to identify any specific student; but is used to help schools and districts understand and improve how technology supports teaching and learning.
