This is a first to ten game. You can play against an ai if you have no one to play with. 2 player mode is where one person uses WASD to move and the other person uses Arrow Keys to move. This can be swapped by pressing \"c\". When playing against ai you can use WASD or Arrow Keys. Press \"shift\" to go invisible. This only applies to orange and has a 7 second cooldown after 3 seconds of invisibility. Press \"ctrl\" for blind mode, where you can see no walls. This is just a challenge mode for fun. This extension does not store any player data in any means of local storage. It only stores variables that reset whenever you close out of the game. The variables are stored using JavaScript: var px = 2, py = 0;\nThis is how x and y co-ords are stored."
