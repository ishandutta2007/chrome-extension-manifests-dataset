It is not a typical test automation, documentation or management tool; it is an assistant for smart session-based testing. It is based on HyBIST (Hypothesis Based Immersive Session Testing), a smart approach to validation in the Agile environment.  \n\nAbout HYBIST\nThe HyBIST approach to SmartQA is smart probing i.e., designing smart probes and probing a system smartly. doSmartQA is a SmartQA toolbox to design probes (analyse, design) & probe smartly (validate, assess).\n\nWhat is PROBING?\nProbing is deep questioning to gain clarity and swiftly address potential issues. Unlike traditional code validation, it goes beyond mere confirmation, focusing on proactive discovery and preventing risks. \n\nKey features of doSmartQA - “Smart Probing Assistant”\nThe act of probing is performed in three phases - Reconnaissance, Exploration & Recoup, in short focussed sessions.\nThe key elements of doSmartQA to assist in this are:\nLandscaper:  Assist in understanding the big picture- persona, expectations, interactions, environment, and note taking- observations, questions, suggestions for multidimensional view. \n* Mind mapper: Help you see the big picture of an entity (user story)\n* Mapper: Assist in charting, persona, scope & and interaction map to help you explore well.\n* Deep diver: Dig in and discover conditions, criteria, potential issues top design well.\n* Designer: Assist in developing smart checklist, test ideas, free-form and level based scenarios for superior coverage.\n* Executor: Track doing, improvise and enhance.\n* Session planner:  Assist in setting up a ‘probing session’ and doing it.\n* Intelligent Assistant: Based on Generative AI, it assists in discovering user expectations, potential issues, criteria, behaviour conditions to accelerate smart probing.\n\nWHO benefits and HOW\nIt benefits QA Practitioners in tech companies with Agile development practices, by boosting their intellectual QA practice.\n\nNote: The enterprise edition of doSmartQA facilitates team collaboration and richer insights.\n\n---\nRequirements: Users of this extension must satisfy OpenAI policy, which states \"You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum age required in your country to consent to use the Services.
