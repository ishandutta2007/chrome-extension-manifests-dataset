Not only does it have simple controls, but it also has addictive gameplay that will keep players hooked for hours.\nAs you can see, a yellow capybara is in the center of the screen. All you have to do is tap on this Capybara to create more capybaras. Since you aim to create a capybara galaxy, you should not hesitate to tap the Capybara constantly to make as many capybaras as possible. Also, pay attention to the energy bar on the left side of the screen. When it is complete, the number of capybaras is doubled. So do not let this bar become empty.
