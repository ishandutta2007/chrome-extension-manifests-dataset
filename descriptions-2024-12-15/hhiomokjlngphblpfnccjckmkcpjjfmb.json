This is a great tool for marketing professionals, influencers, event organizers, online businesses and social media power users.\n\nMoreover, you can add notes, custom fields and tasks (to-do lists) for people you categorized on social media. In other words, you can create your own social media rolodex!\n\nYou can also perform searches on this rolodex, and find people based on the categories, tasks, notes and fields you assigned to them. You can even export your social media rolodex as an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nYou can categorize your social feeds / friends and add colorful tags to their posts so that they would stand out on your timeline. It is super easy and fun to use. \n\nIt is totally free and currently works on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and Ekşi Sözlük. Please send us an email if you want new features or more sites to be added :)\n\nENJOY!\n\n@ Dogan Engin 2021 - All rights are reserved.",
