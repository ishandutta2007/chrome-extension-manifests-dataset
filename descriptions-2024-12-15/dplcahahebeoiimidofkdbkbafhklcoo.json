The Thinkr chrome extension auto-generates personalized trivia games based on your explicit interests through news, blogs, and (coming soon) podcasts, and video! \n\nStudies show that you forget about 95% of what you read. The Thinkr platform helps us fix that. If forgetfulness is the biggest barrier to intelligence, what would you do if you could remember more of what you consumed? What would happen, if instead of 5% remembered, you remembered 10%? What if you remembered 20%? What would happen at work? What would happen at home? How about when when you were with with your friends? The possibilities are limitless and that’s exactly what we’re helping you become.\n\nThinkr tracks visits to over 100 content sites (and growing). As you surf the web and read, our platform creates unique trivia games. When a game is ready (at least once a day), you’ll get a small “Play!” notification on the extension. Playing the game gets you points. Playing the game helps you remember. \n\nPrivacy is important to us. We don’t ask for an email address or login, unless you explicitly provide it for email notifications. We don’t want to know who you are, even if that may be detrimental to our ‘business’ goals. That’s why we only track specific content pages that are pre-approved by our team. We want to help our audiences learn. Period.\n\nThinkr is a trivia platform for digital media. It offers innovative engagement tools for content producers, marketers, and accreditation boards. Thinkr automates the creation of trivia games from written, audio, and video content, allowing these groups to increase engagement and understand content stickiness for their audiences."
