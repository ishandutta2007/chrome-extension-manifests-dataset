With three new resources to learn from, three funds to contribute to, and three petitions to sign every day, you can stay actively engaged well past the news cycle. Our extension ensures that every day, you’re reading something new about the Black Lives Matter movement, finding new places to donate, and signing the petitions that are critical now.\n\nIn addition, we feature a selected piece of art from a Black artist and links to their portfolios/Instagram where you can check them out. Your new tabs are now not only educational, they're also beautiful.\n\nOur content is constantly being updated by you, the users, based on suggested resources and funds. Check out our resources and contribute your own using the google forms on our website. We also provide a way for you to save these resources, as well as those you find online, in the extension itself. We're hoping to have ads on our extension soon and donate 100% of this revenue to organizations that empower Black folks, but to do this, we need to have a large number of users download our extension.\n\nInstall today, leave us a review, and promote us on social media! Every installation helps. \n\nPS -\nWe’re searching for brands and companies to work with us who want to advertise on our extension! 100% OF PROCEEDS will go to various Black lives matter funds. If this is you or anyone you know, please reach out to us via our email address."
