Break past the boundaries of the antiquated brochure projects and poster board presentations and dive deep into student creativity.  With My Page, students can easily modify web data, to create custom sites to show what they know.  This multi-modality approach is perfect for hands on and visual learners, as they watch their words fill a virtual space, that is all too often lacking in the modern day classroom.  \n\nOnce the My Page extension has been added to your device, simply click the extension, visit an existing web page, click the activate button and let freedom fly.  When you are ready to capture your work of art, simply go back to the extension and click the screenshot button and thatâ€™s it.\n\nMy Page is not just for educators.  Bring My Page into the home and create personalized gifts for friends and family.  Add pictures to text and make family memories the focus of any website.\n\nMy Page was created by an educator for educators and can exist only through your generosity.  Please consider supporting our future work by making a donation to the paypal link embedded within the extension itself.\n\n\n \nUnlock any webpage and make the changes you desire.  From images to text, all types of changes are possible.\n\nMy Page is great for school assignments, greeting cards, jokes, special occasions and more.\n\nMy Page will allow you to change any text on any web page....\n\nMy Page will allow you to add and change images on most webpages too\n\nAll changes are temporary and can be undone by refreshing your browser. \n\nSave your changes with a screenshot.\n\n\nFor questions or support please contact\n\nmrteachnology@gmail.com"
