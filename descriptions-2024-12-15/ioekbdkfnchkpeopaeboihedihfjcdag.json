(ALT+SHIFT+N)\n\n∙ Completely mouse-free use with global keyboard shortcut and in-app shortcuts (of course you can use your mouse or trackpad as well)\n∙ Closing the window with ESC bumps you right back into the app you've worked in before calling up Noko\n∙ Search for projects by starting to type any search term\n∙ Automatically syncs with Noko when you pause, switch projects or log time in the web app or in the mobile app, no reloading necessary\n∙ Anything you enter as notes will be synced with the Noko servers so it's securely backed up. You can even switch computers and it will still be there.\n\nWe have a lot of additional features planned for this Chrome extension. Stay tuned for updates! :)\n\nFeel free to contribute code at: https://github.com/RobertDaleSmith/noko-chrome-extension"
