From anywhere, you are able to use the extension to quickly check your grades, and get a glimpse of what's changed. For more information, open SIS from the pop-up, and always bypass logging in again. Better SIS will also automatically clean up some of the less helpful, and messily designed, windows on your Aeries home pages. Additionally, when you open a class' grades, open Better SIS again to have a quick and easy way to calculate your grade change with custom assignment entries (designed for percent-weighted gradebooks). Better SIS will streamline your Aeries experience, in order to spend less time checking grades, and more time working.\n\n== Privacy ==\nBetter SIS runs entirely within your own browser and will not transmit any data outside of it except directly to Aeries to validate your login credentials and to fetch updated grades. These login credentials are saved on your computer and are never transmitted or synced across the internet, except to Aeries.\n\nDeveloped for MVLA District Aeries. Created for Aeries v8.17.9.29. May be incompatible with older / newer versions. Requires an Aeries-hosted SIS system. Aeries extension (???.asp.aeries.net) can be configured depending on the school."
