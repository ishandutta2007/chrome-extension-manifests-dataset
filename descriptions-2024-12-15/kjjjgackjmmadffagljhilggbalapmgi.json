This makes it difficult to navigate through massive amounts of tabs, difficult to create structure across projects, and ultimately it adds distractions and unneeded complexity to the organization process. TabSpace provides an all-in-one visual interface for organizing your tabs in an intuitive way. This extension will allow you to scroll through all your tabs, select them in groups, and organize them however you want in seconds."
