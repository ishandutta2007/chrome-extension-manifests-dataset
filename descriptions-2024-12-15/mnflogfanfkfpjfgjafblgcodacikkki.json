We examine changes to your pages and alert you to issues with potential dire SEO consequences.  SEORadar checks for over 100 distinct site changes and warns you when they occur.   Unplanned changes that affect SEO are an unfortunate reality when it comes to SEO; pages get no indexed, folders get blocked, rel-canonical go away and keywords get removed from titles.  \n \nWe take a snapshot of your website and compare it to the most recent version.   If anything that can impact SEO changes, we generate an alert.  No more surprises!   You can view our archive of HTML source, see actual changes and screenshots and know exactly what was changed and when. \n\nThe Chrome extension allows you to test your staging site from behind the firewall.  The source code is captured and send to your severs to compare against the live version."
