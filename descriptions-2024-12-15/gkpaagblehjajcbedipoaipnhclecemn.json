Keto dieters (i.e., people on a ketogenic diet)  and low carb enthusiasts in general prefer to see the net carb amount (i.e., Total Carbohydrates - Fiber) instead of the total amount of carbs.\n\nThis extension replaces the Sodium column with Net Carbs in the Log Food page on the FitBit.com site.\n\nLimitations: This initial version does not display net carbs in the Premium food report section. It's a limitation I'd like to fix in the future.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not affiliated in any way with FitBit.com.

That extension is pretty useful if you are on diets such as Weight Watchers."
