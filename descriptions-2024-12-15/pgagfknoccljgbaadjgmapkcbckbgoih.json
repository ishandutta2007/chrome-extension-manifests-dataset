Using zkID, you can get credentials signed by entities such as governments, educational institutions, or companies. You can then prove to someone else that you own these credentials, without revealing the entirety of you personal information.\nFor example, assuming you have a signed credential containing your date of birth, you can prove to someone that you are over 18, without having to disclose you name, address or even you age.\nThis technology uses zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic primitive under active research in academia and industry. \nWe are the first platform offering a zero-knowledge authentication system that is using state of the art cryptographic techniques and that is totally user-friendly.\nTo know more, visit zk-id.com."
