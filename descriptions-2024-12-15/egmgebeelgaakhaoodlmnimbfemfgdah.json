The extension is intended to be used for legal purposes only. Users who use the extension for illegal purposes do so at their own risk.\n\nNOTES:\n- Can easily toggle extension to block redirects on specific tabs or all tabs. \n- For ease, use the shortcuts, alt + shift + s/a (or change to your own), to toggle the extension on and off.\n- If a redirect is needed, switch tabs to one with the extension disabled or toggle it off and back on.\n- If you face any issues, https://github.com/Tyson3101/Redirect-Blocker/issues is the best place to go.\n- Hope it's helpful!"
