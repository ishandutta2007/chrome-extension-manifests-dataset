The extension uses a very simple keyword and letter offset cipher to encode and decode a message that can be sent in traditional way as a letter or email! Please understand this is only for fun and not intended as a means of encrypting sensitive data. The cipher can easily be broken, which in itself makes for a fun challenge! So if you want to send a message like old spies and secret agents, the old way, or perhaps it could be used to assist a simply role playing game, then this might be the solution. Ideally both the sender and recipient would have the extension. To use the extension simply provide any single keyword which must be used to encode and decode, then enter your message and hit the decode button! To decode, simply paste the encoded message into the top along with the keyword and hit decode to reveal the secret message! Have fun :)"
