Now not only can you inform others of what you consider \"your side\", you can inform them of what you consider theirs as well--which you might well have gotten wrong, and now they can tell you.\n\nWhen a supported site is detected, the Deflame icon will appear in the address bar. Click to get agree/disagree/ignore on each comment, which indicate how you feel about the author of the comment. Click again to remove all \"ignored\" comments and add a table of who you (dis)agree with at the top of the page. This comes with a short link to a version hosted at defla.me so you can show other commenters how you see the conversation."
