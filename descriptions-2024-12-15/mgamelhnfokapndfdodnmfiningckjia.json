This eliminates the need to copy and paste links, thus saving you time.\n\nAlso works with incomplete urls where the \"http://\"-part isn't included.\n\nTo try out the extension, visit this page for some examples: https://www.laurentvw.com/project/clickable-links\n\nNew since v2.7:\n- Several bug fixes related to url matching\n- Added support for file:// and magnet: uri schemes\n- Options: An option to allow links to be opened in a new tab"
