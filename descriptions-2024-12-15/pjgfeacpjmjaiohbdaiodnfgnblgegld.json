However, HERA is not able to fully automatically respond to all Emails to your property - some must still be managed by the hotel team. This extension is for use with Gmail and helps you by automatically extracting the key request information from the incoming email. Once you confirm that the extracted info is correct, HERA checks your hotel system for valid offers, puts them in an email and sends them to the requester.\n\nFor incoming booking requests all you need to do is double check the information that HERA has read from the Email (eg. Arrival date, Departure date, number of rooms, number of guests, number of children etc.) and click send. HERA will use this data to check your hotel API (setup is required) and automatically send an email (via the HERA service) to the requester with one or more offers based on their request.\n\nThis add-in is free to download. To use this add-in your hotel needs a subscription (and some setup) with Hotel Res Botâ€™s HERA service. If you are interested in signing up for this service you can do so at https://www.hotel-reservation-bot.de/en/ or alternatively contact us directly HERA@hotelresbot.com."
