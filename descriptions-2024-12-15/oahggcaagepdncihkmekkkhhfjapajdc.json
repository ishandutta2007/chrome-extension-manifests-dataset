You'll be unseen on facebook and facebook messenger even when you read the messages your friend sends to you.\n\nHave your friends been mad at you because they noticed you saw their message, and you didn't respond to it? Have you ever wished to use the messenger without people noticing if you have read their messages?\n\nInstall this software extension and when you use Facebook Messenger on the desktop browser, our software will completely remove the “seen” feature from the messenger. So your friends won’t be able to tell if you read their messages.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note this extension is NOT made by Facebook and is made by an independent development team.
