At the same time, most people don't actually know that much about these individuals they're meeting with on a daily basis.\n\nRecess helps you get to know your coworkers because an office that plays together, works well together too.\n\nWhether you're getting to know a new employee, wanting to learn more about the people you already work with, or simply need a creativity break during a long meeting, Recess is a great way to introduce some fun back into the workday."
