For example, it is hard to tell how many of asset \"X\" you own and how much Aether/hour is generated from your position in asset \"X\". The purpose is to remove images, sort alphabetically and sum Aether income generated per hour. \n\nHOW: This extension modifies HTML (ONLY) on the R Planet staking rewards page. This extension does not require any logins and is simply a front-end skin for an already existing platform. No data is stored, nor sent. The functionality of this extension will grow with R Planets new features until the dashboard is updated and becomes more descriptive.\n\n**This extension is compatible with ALL supported R Planet stake-able assets.**"
