Wanted to learn something on YouTube but always get distracted by your recommended feed? Fear no more, \"YouTube Distraction Disabler\" is here to remove all of the unrelated videos on YouTube and only show you what you want.\n\nFinally got some free time and want to deliberately procrastinate on YouTube? That's ok too, just simply click the extension icon and turn off one of the options that you choose to block. The options are \"Home\", \"Related\", \"Comments\" and \"Notifications\", which corresponds to your home feed, related videos next to the video you're currently watching, the comments down below as well as the notification bell."
