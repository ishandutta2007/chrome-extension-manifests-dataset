Some companies have taken it upon themselves to declare any site with seemingly conservative opinion writers as part of their staff \"trustworthy with caveats\" or \"not trustworthy\" at all. This is a direct assault on our democracy, as the free flow of thought and information is a pillar of our democratic societal philosophy. Enough is enough. \n\nTo help combat this problem, we've created LibGuard, an extension designed specifically to detect sites with progressive agendas at the core of their news coverage. Any website that purports itself to be a truthworthy news site while slanting its news coverage to the left has been tagged with a warning so the user understands what type of site they are going to. The user may then proceed with caution, or be directed to a site without a left wing agenda. We will update the site list as new sites are found that are attempting to skew their coverage. We will also be adding an option to report sites that are found so the database can stay up to date with attempts to circumvent the filters. \n\nIf you find this extension useful, please donate to the cause so we can help keep the news and information flowing free, without the progressive agenda based coverage having so much of an impact."
