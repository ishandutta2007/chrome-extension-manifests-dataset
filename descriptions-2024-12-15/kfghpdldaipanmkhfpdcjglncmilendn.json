It is then necessary to look in the source code of the website and find the URL of the feed.\n\nThis extension makes it possible to avoid this manipulation because the URLs of the RSS feeds of the website are displayed directly!\n\nIn addition, this extension allows you to easily retrieve the RSS feed from several sites that do not offer one natively:\n\n- Reddit: the extension can retrieve RSS feeds from your Reddit homepage but also from a Reddit sub, a profile or post comments\n- Kickstarter: the RSS feed of a Kickstarter project is retrieved\n- Vimeo: RSS feed from a Vimeo channel\n- Github: the extension retrieves RSS feeds from a Github repository (releases, commits, tags) and from a Github user (activity)\n- Gitlab: same as Github\n- Medium: retrieves the RSS feed of a page with a keyword (tag)\n\nYou can also open this popup from the keyboard shortcut: Alt+Shift+R. You can edit it in your Chrome settings (Extensions > Keyboard shortcuts).\n\nYou can copy the URL of an RSS feed by clicking on the \"Copy URL\" button. If you want to copy the URLs of all RSS feeds found, click \"Copy all URLs\".\n\n= Feedback\nIf you encounter a problem using Get RSS Feed URL extension, or would like to request an enhancement, feel free to create an issue on https://github.com/shevabam/get-rss-feed-url-extension !\n\n= Privacy Policy\nThe extension does not collect any user information or other information. Some data can be requested using the XHR API (only GET requests) in order to provide more context to retrieve a website's RSS feed.\n\nThe extension does not store any data on the browser or on the computer."
