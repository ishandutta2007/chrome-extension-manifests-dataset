This leads most of us to do \"research\" on RateMyProfessors.com to find the easiest and/or best professor for each of our classes. Wouldn't it be nice, however, if you didn't have to search for each individual professor? Professor Plug is a web browser add-on that instantly creates links to professor ratings directly from the class registration page! It has been made specifically for BYU students."
