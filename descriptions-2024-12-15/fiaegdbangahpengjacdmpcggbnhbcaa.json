It checks for slot availability every 60 seconds (configurable) and alerts on slot availability playing a voice note so you can immediately book your slot. Instead of depending on the API this extension directly checks through the website with a logged in user session and hence it can check for slots realtime.\n\nNote: This plugin does not book the slot for you and it has to be done by you only. Also note that your login session may expire every few minutes. We strongly recommend you try this plugin only on specific hours of the day when new slots are expected."
