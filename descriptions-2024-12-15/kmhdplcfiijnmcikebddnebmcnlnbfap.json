Such as Reddit, Google, GitHub, Dev.to and Medium. The current implementation works well on most websites. All websites are built differently and some may have bad practices that interfere with this plugin which are mostly inline styles with the important property with high specificity(CSS).\n\nNo ads for spyware. 100% free. Try it for yourself and see better today!\n\nCredit to David Nichols at https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40 for color schemes."
