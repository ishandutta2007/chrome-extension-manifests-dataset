They also now have the power to read and even modify files on the computers of innocent non-suspects. If a sinister official abuses this power (e.g. planting child porn in an ex-girlfriend/ex-boyfriend's computer), there's nothing you can do about it. They have legal immunity, and if you even post on social media or write to a newspaper about the matter, you'll be jailed for 10 years. Does that make you feel safe?\n\nI've written this as part of the #StopDataRetention campaign. \nFind out more by reading \n - My article: http://tharunka.arc.unsw.edu.au/kill-people-based-metadata/\n - Scott Ludlam's article: http://junkee.com/its-time-to-stop-the-governments-data-retention-laws/42651\n\nThe Firefox version is here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-privacy-relabeller/\n\nI can't take credit for the idea itself, I just wrote the code. I saw a photoshopped image of the idea a few weeks ago, but honestly can't remember where. Please tell me if you know where the idea came from.\n\nIf you spot a bug, email davisml.md@gmail.com.\nIf you want to make sure this extension isn't malicious, look at the source code. (There should be a link to it somewhere on the installation page.)\n\nWritten by Matthew Davis"
