Did you miss the last hit in your favorite stream? You're one shortcut away of discovering new songs in a very conveniant way. Access your last found items to keep an organized list of the songs the extension has matched. Get directly in the extension their Spotify URI, Deezer URL or YouTube video (if any found). \nYou can either use only the shortcut version (by default bound to Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+X, but can be rebound in Chrome Extensions mappings page settings) or use the little UI with the big (very very big) record button (you always want to click a big button, right?).\nIt comes with a MIND BLOWING set of 2 themes!"
