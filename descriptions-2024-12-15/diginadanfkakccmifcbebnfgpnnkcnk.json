Use cases such as login, registration, and your web app main features are checked at each release so things will not break anymore.\n\n\n2) If your dev team spends a lot of time writing and maintaining tests:\n\nNOTEST generates e2e/user tests, unit tests, integration tests, and visual component tests while your team develops new features. Think of NOTEST as you test co-developer.\n\n\n3) If every time your customer care finds a new bug, it is difficult to debug and to transform it into a test:\n\nNOTEST can generate a test from a bug report. You can then fix the bug, and it will automatically re-run the test to make sure it is fixed.\n\nMore at https://notest.io"
