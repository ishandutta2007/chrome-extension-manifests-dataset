The dragon's immense wings, lined with deep crimson membranes, stretch outward, creating a sense of both power and grace. Its posture is both watchful and regal, as if commanding the entire cavern. The cave walls, jagged and ancient, loom high above, framing the dragon in an epic silhouette. In the distance, a lone figure stands on a narrow ledge, dwarfed by the dragonâ€™s size, facing the mighty beast with a mix of courage and awe.
