Do you want quick and easy access to a database of ASL signs? Then this Chrome Extension might be right for you!\n\n[HOW TO USE]\nSimply turn on the extension via the extensions toolbar, then highlight any word on your screen. \n\nHighlighting any text (using your mouse) will open a search bar in the top right corner of the page. If the word is in our ASL database,  the search box border will turn green, and a gif displaying the ASL sign will pop up in the top left of the page. To close the gif, simply click anywhere else.\n\nIf the search box border is red, that means we do not currently have a gif for that word; sorry about that! We hope to grow our dictionary in the near future.\n\n[INSTALLATION NOTE]\nWhen you install this extension, it will say that the extension can \"read and change all your data on all websites.\" This is because the tool renders a popup which changes the webpage structure. We do NOT read or store any information whatsoever, and never will.\n\n[KNOWN ISSUES]\nThe extension does not work within Google Docs because the text in Google Docs is not a part of the web page in the standard way.\n\nWe hope you find this extension helpful!\n\nP.S. If you wish there were more signs, so do we! We'd love any suggestions about good ASL databases we can add to the current collection. Please email us with any tips, thanks!"
