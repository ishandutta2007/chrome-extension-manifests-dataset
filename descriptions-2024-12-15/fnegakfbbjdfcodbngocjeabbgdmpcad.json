It's a smart contract that allows you to add a message to a nonfungible token if you own it.\n\nOpenSea is the largest general marketplace for nonfungible tokens, with the broadest set of categories and the most items.  In other words, it's kind of like eBay for CryptoKitties.\n\nThis extension allows you to interact with Conlan's NFT Scribe contract right from an OpenSea page.  If a token you don't own has no inscriptions, it does nothing.  If a token you don't own has inscriptions, it will inject them into the token's detail page on OpenSea.  If you own a token and it has no inscriptions, it will inject a form that allows you to add inscriptions.  If you own a token and it has inscriptions, it will inject the inscriptions and a form that allows you to add new inscriptions. \n\n\nUpdate for v0.0.2:  You can now inscribe straight from an OpenSea page.\n\nPlease view our privacy policy at http://danieljamesviau.com/scribe-extension-privacy-policy.html.  We don't collect, store, or share your information."
