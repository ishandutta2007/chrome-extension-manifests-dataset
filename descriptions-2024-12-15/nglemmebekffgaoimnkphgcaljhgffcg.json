Sorry for all the folks who experienced downtime. If it’s working for you, it would be great if you left a positive review since the only people leaving reviews are the people annoyed when it stops working. If everyone leaves negative reviews for free software, there’s no motivation to keep it going.**\n\nThe year is 2023 and robots have taken hold of the internet. Humans struggle to distinguish messages sent by their own species from those generated by the tools they created. Confused and manipulated by the unreasonable effectiveness of the large language models, the humans devise yet another tool to help them find robots in the wild. Its name is BLADERUNNER.AI. \n\nIn the age of AI, the constellation of digital experiences will collectively become a GAN, where bots are the generators (objective: fool humans into thinking that the AI is another human) and humans are the discriminator (objective: detect AI impostors). Organizations will be held to a higher standard of discriminator accuracy as shareholders, staff, and customers become increasingly wary of AI-generated content. Are these organizations prepared to reach this standard of accuracy? Is anyone? Will we all need our own night vision goggles for detecting AI in the new wild?"
