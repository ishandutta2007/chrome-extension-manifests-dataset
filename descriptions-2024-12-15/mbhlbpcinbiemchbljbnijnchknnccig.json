This plugin facilitates the recording of meetings, accompanied by a real-time transcription service. Upon the conclusion of a meeting, it proficiently generates a succinct summary, encapsulating the key discussions and outcomes.\n\nAccess to this plugin is exclusive to registered YBL users, ensuring a seamless and integrated user experience. The operational mechanics of this plugin draw parallels with renowned services such as Otter.ai and the TL;DV Chrome Extensions. Its functionality includes the participation of a digital meeting or note-taking assistant, which discreetly joins the meeting to facilitate the process.\n\nThe core technology underpinning this plugin involves the YBL backend's real-time processing of the audio stream, converting it into a transcribed format with remarkable accuracy. This transcription is dynamically relayed to the plugin's user interface through WebSocket technology, allowing for immediate display and interaction.\n\nThe plugin's utility extends beyond the meeting duration. When a user exits the meeting or terminates the recording, the digital assistant gracefully departs from the session. Subsequently, the YBL backend undertakes the task of generating a comprehensive meeting summary. This summary, a valuable asset for post-meeting review and documentation, is readily accessible to users via the YBL web application at https://app.ybl.ai.\n\nPresently, this version of the plugin is adept at processing only the audio stream from the meetings, focusing on delivering high-quality audio transcription and summarization."
