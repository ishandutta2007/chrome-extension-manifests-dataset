The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking their symbol (usually X or O) in one of the nine squares. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row - either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally - before your opponent does.\n\nDespite its simple rules and gameplay, Tic Tac Toe requires careful planning and strategy to win. Each move can set up multiple opportunities for both players, making it a challenging and exciting game to play. With its easy-to-learn mechanics and endless possibilities for gameplay, Tic Tac Toe is a timeless classic that is sure to keep you entertained for hours."
