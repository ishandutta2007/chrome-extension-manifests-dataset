Tentatively gives you the power to do so! Need to mark part of your shared calendar as tentative so that friends, family, and colleagues avoid inviting you to meetings? Tentatively gives you that ability!\n\nAlthough Google Calendar allows you to mark yourself as “Maybe” on events to which you’re invited, it doesn’t allow you to do so for events you create yourself. Tentatively fixes that!\n\nTo use Tentatively after you’ve installed it, simply navigate to your Google Calendar, click on the Tentatively extension icon in Chrome, and click on the calendar entry you’d like to mark as “Tentative”/“Maybe”. Then wait a few seconds for Google Calendar to show the updated calendar entry, or refresh the Google Calendar web page to see the update immediately.\n\nIf you need to cancel calendar entry selection after clicking on the Tentatively extension icon, you can simply press the Esc key on your keyboard or click the extension icon again.\n\nWhen you first use Tentatively, Chrome will ask you if you want to allow Tentatively to “View and edit events on all your calendars” and “See and download any calendar you can access using your Google Calendar”. Although you need to give the extension these permissions, note that no permissions or credentials are ever shared with the makers of Tentatively or any other entity. These permissions are granted solely to the installed extension and neither these permissions nor any calendar information is ever transferred to any remote servers.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://tentatively.xyz/privacy"
