But sometimes they can be overwhelming.\n\nGoldeneye lets you search by alpha code or species name to look up:\n- alpha codes\n- common names\n- species with potentially confusing alpha codes\n- codes that are not in use because of conflicts (e.g. PRWA)\n\nGoldeneye is also available as a website: http://alphacodes.net\n\nGoldeneye supports all species, subspecies, species complexes, and named hybrids included in the Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) and Institute of Bird Population's (IBP) alpha code lists. When the authorities use different codes for the same species, the other codes are indicated in the listing. IBP codes are preferentially listed first everywhere except for BBL-specific listings (e.g. the listing for \"CAGO,\" a BBL-only code)\n\nThank you to Cayenne Sweeney whose painting of a Barrow's Goldeneye is the icon and banner image for this extension.
