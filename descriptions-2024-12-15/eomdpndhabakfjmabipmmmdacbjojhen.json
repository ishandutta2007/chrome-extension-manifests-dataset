It recognizes the broader set of changes that real developers do:\n- Move\n- Update\n- Copy/Paste\n- Find/Replace\n\nEnd result? 30% less code to review. Instead of scrutinizing moved code as if it were newly added and deleted, code reviewers can train their limited time on the most significant changed lines.\n\nðŸ¤– AI SUMMARIES AND COMPLETIONS \nGet the gist of what changed in a file before diving into it. Skip files that don't need your attention.\nAccelerate commenting with history-aware completions that remove redundant explanations to developers who habitually struggle in a particular area.\n\nâœ¨ REVIEW THE NEW\nTraditional PR review tools show the full changeset for each file regardless of what you've reviewed before. GitClear remembers what changes you have previously seen, and by default, only presents the changes to each file since you last saw it.\n\nSee more about the Best GitHub Alternative Pull Request Review Tool: https://www.gitclear.com/best_github_alternative_pull_request_review_tool\n\nGITHUB & GITLAB INTEGRATION\nSeamlessly integrate GitClear's CodeCruncher into your workflow.
