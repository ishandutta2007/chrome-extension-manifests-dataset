This enables you to use Lectio without having to adapt to a new user interface.\n\nFeatures:\n- Multi Browser Support\n- Assignment filtering based on delivered and missing status\n- Assignment deadline countdown timer with colors\n- Profile images in messages\n- Colored schedule blocks\n- Schedule colors highlighting cancelled and changed classes\n- A wide responsive layout\n- Colored grades\n- and much more soon to be added...\n\nThis extensions primary focus is QoL features with a small apperance overhaul. We wanted to provide a FOSS extension alternative, where every student or teacher using Lectio could participate in the development.\n\nThe open nature of this project also ensures that development can continue past interest of the original developers. With the closed source extension \"Lectio Improver\" now being abandoned, we feel like this is the optimal time for you to jump aboard and help this project become something big!"
