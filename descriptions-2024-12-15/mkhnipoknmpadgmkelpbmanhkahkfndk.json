Storing all this info in excel file or maybe even worse in txt file is not helping anyone. You don't need to do that anymore. I got you, your life will be easier.\n\n2 - How?\nVisit list.eraykaratas.com and create an account. Create your collections. Click + button to start adding urls to your list. \n\nYou can;\n- set statuses (pending, completed, dropped)\n- add your rating\n- add notes\n- share your collections with your friends\n- add icon to collections\n- add tags so you can filter your list better\n- bulk edit, delete, update\n\n3 - Why Extension?\nDidn't I told you? I'll make your life as easier as possible, you don't even need to visit our dashboard. Just create your api keys and collections from our dashboard, fill your api keys in extension and you are done!\n\nVisit supported websites (steam, myanimelist, mydramalist and more) there will be a bar on the bottom of the page. When you click to update button with selected collections (you can choose multiple collections) it'll send it to our dashboard in real-time.\n\n4 - Still didn't get it? Here your use cases;\na. You are huge fan of anime, drama, game and movies. You have thousands of them in your pocket. But they are all in excel file. Hard to maintain and filter.\n\nb. Surfing through myanimelist creating your seasonal anime list, creating romance dramas in mydramalist or adding games to wishlist in steam. Different websites, designs and dashboards.\n\nThat is what I'm trying to solve. All your collections in one place with best UI & UX."
