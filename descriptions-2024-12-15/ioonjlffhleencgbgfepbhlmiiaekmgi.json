I’ve been using MevinX myself and have seen promising results, being able to engage more meaningfully with posts that align with my interests in just 30 minutes a day.\n\nIt can help curate relevant posts aligned with your interests from various social media platforms, provides context from your own notes, likes, bookmarks and your previous posts, and it even suggests tailored replies in multiple media format, text, images, meme gifs. All in your own authentic voice.\n\nAs there has been increase in buildinpublic, or indiehacking for the past few years, there have been a lot of people wanting to build products, but fail to realize the importance to keep themselves engaged online, as that is as important as, if not more than just building a product. Mevin would be an array of tools to help indiehackers build a meaningful online presence."
