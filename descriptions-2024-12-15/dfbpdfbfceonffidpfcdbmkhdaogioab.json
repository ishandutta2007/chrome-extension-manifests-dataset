Thanks to this translator you can see terms like 'house prices', 'Malcolm Turnbull' and 'Christopher Pyne' magically transformed into 'avocado prices', 'Richy McRichface' and 'the most annoying man in the world'. Developed specifically with an Australia audience in mind, this is the perfect tool to help voters get through the 2016 election campaign without going crazy."
