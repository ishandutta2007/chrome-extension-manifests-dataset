Just click the settings (gear) icon in the upper right corner of the Dashboard and flip the toggle for display frequency. \n\nYou can always access the Dashboard by clicking on the browser extension icon in the upper right.\n\n---\n\nRead Across The Aisle gives you a visual representation of your filter bubble. Our dashboard shows you your most-read news websites so you can see where you're spending the most time reading. With the view options, you can see just the last 24 hours, week, or even your indefinite history, so you can track your behavior over time.\n\nGet Free Wall Street Journal Access!\n\nClick the WSJ link (below your most-read site list) to get a free, renewable, guest pass to the Wall Street Journal. Every week you will see the registration prompt again, but you can use the same email address to register each time. \n\nSocial Network Tracking\n\nSocial networks like Facebook and Twitter are tracked separately, so the color assigned to these sites is based on the partisanship ratings of the links you click on while on social media. So if you click on lots of liberal news from Facebook, then Facebook will show up bright blue. If you click on a mix of news from Facebook, it will show up as purple. The idea is that you can see (1) how much time you spend on social media; and (2) how the news you are exposed to on FB differs from the news you find organically.\n\nWe look forward to adding new features, such as customized article recommendations, the ability to display your Dashboard only once or twice per day, and badges to track your accomplishments. Let us know what new features you'd like to see most, and if you'd like to support this free tool, please consider donating via PayPal: \n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=BMM59P2BFUC7A&lc=US&item_name=Read%20Across%20The%20Aisle&no_note=0&cn=Add%20special%20instructions%20to%20the%20seller:&no_shipping=2&currency_code=USD&bn=PP-DonationsBF:btn_donateCC_LG.gif:NonHosted\n\nThanks!\nThe Read Across The Aisle team"
