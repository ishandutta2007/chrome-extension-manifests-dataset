It is a type of security breach specifically designed to steal and/or publish data to an unsecured or illegal location.\n\nA data breach is also known as a data spill or data leak.\n\nA data breach occurs when an unauthorized hacker or attacker accesses a secure database or repository. Data breaches are typically geared toward logical or digital data and often conducted over the Internet or a network connection.\n\nA data breach may result in data loss, including financial, personal and health information. A hacker also may use stolen data to impersonate himself to gain access to a more secure location. For example, a hacker's data breach of a network administrator's login credentials can result in access of an entire network.\nBy utilizing Have I been pwned's API, this extension helps you understand to know about data breaches."
