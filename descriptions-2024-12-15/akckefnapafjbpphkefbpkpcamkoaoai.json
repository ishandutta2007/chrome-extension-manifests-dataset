It also includes the official wallet from the desktop edition of Galaxy Station, which users can use to manage their Cosmos blockchain accounts (supports Ledger).\n\nThis plugin enables webpages to connect to Cosmos networks, allowing them to pull live state and events from the blockchain as well as create new transactions. \n\nUsers can interact with DApps by navigating to a Galaxy-powered webpage and connecting their wallet when prompted. After authenticating, the DApp is able to read blockchain data and request transactions to be signed through the Galaxy Station extension. Whenever a transaction is generated by the DApp, the user is first given a secure prompt where they can confirm its contents with a password before it is signed and broadcasted."
