That's all!\n\nAs of v0.0.2, the extension also shows a thumb if you've thumbed up the current song.  That way you don't click back to the browser window to thumb up a song when you've already done so.\n\nThis extension does not collect any personal information.  The only permission it requests is to run on *.pandora.com (or else what would be the point? :) ).\n\nTo save CPU cycles, the title only updates every five seconds.\n\nThis extension is not affiliated with Pandora.\n\nThis extension is open-source, and is available at https://github.com/cxw42/pandora-title-in-tab ."
