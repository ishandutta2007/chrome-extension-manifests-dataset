Most users never actually check new, meaning that it's a small subset of fairly dedicated users who actually decide what the majority of HN users see.\n\nThis Chrome extension is a small attempt to remedy that. By putting a few new posts at the top of the front page, you can maintain your normal browsing patterns while actively participating in deciding what will hit the front page next.\n\nDeveloped by Brian Brunner.
