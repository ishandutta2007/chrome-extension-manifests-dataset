As of now it:\n\n- Adds more playback speed options\n- Allows you to toggle play/pause by pressing spacebar/\"k\", full screen with \"f\", and mute with \"m\"\n- Allows you to skip forward/backward 5s with your right/left arrows, or 10s with \"l\"/\"j\"\n\nAfter installing the extension, it will automatically run on any Zoom LTI Pro recording page.\n\nUPDATE 1/5/2022: Since there was an update to the Zoom LTI Pro page the extension stopped working for a bit, but that has been fixed. Zoom also added their own hotkeys for playing/pausing with the space bar as well as forward/backward skipping with the arrow keys so I removed that from the extension, but the f/m/j/k/l hotkeys still work."
