The information gathered is intended to be imported into Genealogical DNA Analysis Tool, a program that allows you to manage your DNA matches. \n\nPlease note that only English language pages are supported although the extension may function in other language sites.\n\nThe extension's primary function is to read pedigree trees ( Geni and MyHeritage) and convert them to Ahnentafel. See also the included Pedigree to GedCom application that can read pedigrees from other sources.\n\nIt will also read information on matches from MyHeritage as well as adding a couple of utilities to some GedMatch web pages. \n\nBefore using for the first time, right-click the icon and select 'Help' from the menu. This will give guidance to setting up and using the extension.
