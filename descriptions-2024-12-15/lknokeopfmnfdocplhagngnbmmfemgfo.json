However, thanks to blockchain technology, users can select the TFN option (Track for the Nature). By enabling the TFN option, the user matures in his virtual wallet a token for the value of € 0.05 for every thousand searches made through Usesho. the amount of value could increase or decrease based on information that the user decides to make available to Usesho. upon exceeding € 100, the user has the right to use his credit in one of the works dedicated to cleaning the oceans from plastics, wastless projects and recovery of urban waste at the 100% cycle. Each of our research is a small contribution to improving the future."
