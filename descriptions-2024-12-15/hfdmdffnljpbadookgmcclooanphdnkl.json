So pasting anywhere in these fields would overwrite them.\n- Force pasting in paste-disabled fields doesn't work when the field contains text that is selected in its entirety. This a side effect of a safeguard put in place to avoid duplicate pasting in the very rare case where a paste-enabled field's text is selected in its entirety and replaced with the same text as before (therefore should remain unchanged). IF YOU EVER FACE THIS ISSUE, SIMPLY CLEAR THE FIELD BEFORE PASTING AND IT SHOULD WORK AS EXPECTED."
