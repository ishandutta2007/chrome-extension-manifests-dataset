With this extension, you can modify the requests for chosen websites before the data is sent to Google Analytics. \n\nVersion 1.0\nIn this first version the only thing that will be modified is the hostname of the visited page. If the extension is activated and the hostname is meeting your RegEx pattern rule, the hostname that gets sent to Google Analytics will be \"internal\". \n\nAs long as the extension is turned on and you set up a filter in Google Analytics that excludes hostname equal to \"internal\", you will not be registered in the statistics. Make sure all colleagues and partners are using this extension and you will never have to set up IP based filters again!\n\nPlanned Updates:\n- Ability to pick your own parameters and replacement values\n- Ability to add domains without RegEx\n- Support for other web analytics platforms"
