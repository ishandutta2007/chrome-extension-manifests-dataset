It's a fun way to liven up your new tabs in Chrome and explore new imagery and photography. \n\nThe extension uses caching technology to ensure that the images are displayed almost immediately upon opening a new tab. This means there is no noticeable delay or loading time.\n\nOne of the key features of Unsplash New Tabs is its configurability. You have the option to personalize it by choosing to display your own Unsplash photos or the photos of another Unsplash user, including their likes. This replaces the default setting of displaying random images from Unsplash.\n\nPlease note, this is an independent extension and is not officially associated with Unsplash. The developer of this extension does not have any affiliation with Unsplash."
