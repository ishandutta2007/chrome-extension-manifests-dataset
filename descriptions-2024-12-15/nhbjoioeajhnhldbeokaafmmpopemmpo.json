Simple Autoscroll will help you with just that! \n\nWith Simple Autoscroll, you simply set how many pixels to scroll at set intervals, press \"Go\", and start reading! To stop the scrolling, simply click on the extension icon and the scrolling will cease.\n\nSimple as that!\n\nTips:\n- Want to scroll from the bottom to the top? Simply add a negative value into the \"Scroll X Pixels\" field.\n- For a smooth scrolling experience, simple input lower values for both pixels and milliseconds. For example scrolling 1 pixel every 30 milliseconds provides a nice, smooth scrolling experience. increasing the millisecond count makes it slower.\n\nSimple Autoscroll has not and never will never read any of your data and will only modify a page as needed to make autoscrolling work properly. Simple Autoscroll also does not make any network requests. Simple Autoscroll is an open-source extension.\n\nNote: Doesn't work on all websites.\n\n\nDisclosure: This extension uses the Amazon affiliate program to generate revenue.
