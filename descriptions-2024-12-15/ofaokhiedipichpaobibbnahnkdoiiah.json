It uses AI to predict which data is most relevant on a HTML page and allows saving it to Excel or CSV file (XLS, XLSX, CSV).\n\nCommunity Support group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/instantdata/\n\nThis tool does not require website specific scripts, instead it uses heuristic AI analysis of HTML structure to detect data for extraction. If the prediction is not satisfactory,  it lets the user customize the selections for greater accuracy. This type of scraping technology is much more convenient, because it does not require large user created libraries of scraping scripts,  which often become filled with outdated and redundant versions. This means that our scraping method works just as well with small and lesser known websites, as it does with global giants like Amazon. Also, our users do not need to have any coding, json or xml skills!\n\nInstant Data Scraper FEATURES:\n* Detecting data for extraction with AI.\n* Detecting when dynamic data has loaded.\n* Delay and maximum wait time customization for desired crawling speed\n* Support for pagination on websites.\n* Automatic navigation to next page via buttons or links.\n* Support for infinite scrolling.\n* Extracted data preview with copy and paste support.\n* Data export to Excel spreadsheet or CSV file.\n* Extracted data column renaming and filtering.\n\nThis extension is completely FREE. Instant Data Scraper works well in unison with SEO tools, CRM recruiter systems, sales leads management tools or email marketing campaigns. Web scraping and data downloading is made easy with our tool. Furthermore, you have data security and privacy as the scraped data does not leave your browser.\n\nInstant Data Scraper USE CASES:\n* Lead generation for companies and freelancers.\n* Growth hackers looking for easy ways to collect data.\n* Recruiters looking for job candidates.\n* Crawl results from search engines.\n* Get product pricing data from e-commerce websites.\n* Amazon sellers, distributors and review analysts.\n* Get email and addresses and phone numbers from directories.\n* Get contact info from professional association websites.\n* Scrape reviews and ratings.\n* Analyze posts for likes, comments, connection and contacts.\n* Extract emails and ID from social media profiles.\nDeveloper promise: This extension does not contain any malware or spyware beyond standard Google Analytics."
