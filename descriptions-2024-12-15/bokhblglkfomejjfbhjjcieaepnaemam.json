Works both on Firefox and Chrome (and possibly others).\n\nOne can create personal lists of words to avoid or use preset lists available in the extension.\n\nWhen/Why to use this Extension\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn case you are struggling and/or recovering from a mental condition or addiction that is reinforced by External or Trauma triggers. Such conditions are:\n\n*  Addictions: Alcoholism, Drug Addictions\n*  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n*  Eating Disorders (ED) \n\nAs these conditions can be fueled by triggers, facing one while off-guard (e.g: while casually browsing) can cause stress, spiraling and thoughts of relapse.\n\nThere are several places that can serve triggering content without explicitly searching for it (looking at you Youtube Related Videos), and these places have been targeted first by this Extension."
