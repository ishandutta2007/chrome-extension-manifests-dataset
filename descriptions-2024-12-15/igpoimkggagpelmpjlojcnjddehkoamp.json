This is especially bad with students. So we developed a relatively unobtrusive way of checking in with yourself, your mental health, and the world, all while being productive!\n\nWhat it does\nWe developed a Chrome Extension that helps you stay on task for certain set \"focus times\" and gives you free time for timed breaks, as well as a \"mental health vibe check\" in order to provide needed reassurance and helpful tips to a productive and healthy work environment. Check-In Chicken is made to help you be productive, but not at the cost of your mental health.\n\nHow we built it\nUsing resources such as Google Developer, we created the chrome web extension.\n\nChallenges we ran into\nThe Pomodoro-style timer was difficult to implement, as it features two distinct timers cycling through each other to monitor work-time and break-time. This challenge was highlighted the inability for chrome extensions to store data meaningfully without the use of database. Learning the structure of how Chrome extensions work, as well as how to make them efficient was difficult, as none of us had developed one before. The check-in implementation was also difficult to implement, as we wanted to check-in on the user occasionally without disturbing their workflow, and providing them with meaningful mental health support. Developing the UI/UX to be approachable and friendly, while also capable and straightforward was a challenge as well, but one we believe we overcame.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nDeveloping the UI/UX to be approachable and friendly, while also capable and straightforward was a challenge as well, but one we believe we overcame with our mascot Gappy. None of our team-members have worked with Chrome Extensions before, with most of our experience with standard web apps. The Pomodoro-style timer was surprisingly complex to develop within the confines of Chrome Extension's capabilities, so developing a working timer was a really big win for us.\n\nPhoto/Logo found here.
