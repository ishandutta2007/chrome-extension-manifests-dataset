PuTTYgen is also counted as its primary function. PuTTYgen uses its format in .ppk to generate the keys. \n\nPuttygen is a part of putty. PuTTYgen originally made for the Microsoft Windows operating system, but now it is used for a multi-operating system like Linux, macOS, etc. \n\nFor Windows, PuTTYgen.exe is the graphical tool, whereas, for the Linux OS, it is the command-line version and accessible by SSH commands.\n\nGenerally, the Unix uses the command line type interface MS-Dos to get anything to be processed. Users need to write command lines.\n\nThese command lines can run over the network, and the network protocol like SSH, Telnet, Rlogin, etc. helps these purposes.\n\nThe network protocol SSH is a cryptographic network protocol, and it helps you access an internet server while encrypting any of the information sent to it.\n\nThe other protocol is Telnet, Rlogin if you have a login account on a web server or connect to a UNIX system. PuTTY helps you in such kind of transfer.\n\nPuTTY can be easily installed with the PuTTY.msi package. There is no need for separate downloading. You can easily install and run the PuTTYgen very quickly once you download the PuTTY software."
