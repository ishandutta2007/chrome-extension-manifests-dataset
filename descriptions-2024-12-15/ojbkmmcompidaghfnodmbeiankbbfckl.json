(By default, your preferences are set to open them in-browser with Chrome's PDF plugin).\n\nThis extension blocks two common ways of forcing your browser to download PDF files, allowing you to handle them consistently and as you choose.\n\nWARNING, USE AT OWN RISK:\nSome websites load pdfs into invisible elements for download, causing them not to be seen at all when this extension is enabled. Unfortunately I can't find a good solution for this :(\nMost commonly where this is encountered (eg on google docs), the pdf is linked with a name not corresponding to it's filename. To this end the extension now ignores links that don't have \".pdf\" in them.\n\nI wrote this app for myself and my friends at uni, to combat university pdfs being linked with forced download. I don't really know much Javascript/HTTP, so no guarantees :)"
