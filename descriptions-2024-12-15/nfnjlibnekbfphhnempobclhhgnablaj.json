With this extension, you can select developers to follow, and Spectrum CIG Tracker will automatically notify you of their posts and MoTD updates through instant OS notifications, ensuring you’re always in the loop without needing to refresh Spectrum. Simply keep your browser open in the background to receive updates effortlessly.\n\nThe intuitive interface makes it easy to customize your tracking preferences, while a detailed notification history provides quick access to past updates whenever needed. Spectrum CIG Tracker operates smoothly with optimized login handling: after your initial login, the extension uses stored cookies, allowing you to close the RSI website and still receive updates.\n\nThe Spectrum CIG Tracker operates safely within your browser, with no data shared with external servers. For added peace of mind, the full code is available to view on GitHub. https://github.com/f4sh/Spectrum-CIG-Tracker\n\nPlease make sure cookies are enabled, as Spectrum CIG Tracker relies on them for authentication. If cookies are missing, the extension will prompt you to log in. Once logged in, you’re all set - no need to keep the RSI website open, just your browser.\n\nChangelog:\n\nRelease Notes for 2.0 - November 11, 2024\n\nImprovements:\n- Increased User Tracking Limit: Now supports tracking up to 9 developers.\n- New CIG Team Members for Tracking: Added Spectral-CIG to the available tracking list.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.9 - November 8, 2024\n\nBug Fixes:\n- Aligning with the prior fix in notifications: Fixed duplicate filtering in history to ensure only unique messages are displayed across different lobbies.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.8 - November 7, 2024\n\nBug Fixes:\n- Custom Emoji Handling: Reverted to using shortcodes for CIG-provided emojis due to OS notifications not supporting server-fetched custom emoji images.\n- Date and Time Sorting: Enhanced sorting to handle identical timestamps with a unique fallback, ensuring consistent order for notifications.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.7 - November 6, 2024\n\nBug Fixes:\n- HTML Entity Decoding: Resolved display issues for notifications containing special characters (e.g., apostrophes) by implementing custom entity decoding for better readability.\n- Expanded Emoji Support: Added more emojis to fix a bug where only shortcode was visible, ensuring emojis appear in notifications as intended.\n- Error Handling: Improved error logging for clearer diagnostics, particularly for cookie and API-related issues.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.6 - November 5, 2024\n\nBug Fixes:\n- Display Most Recent Messages: Now shows only the most recent MoTD, and the last message / thread per CIG developer, as intended.\n- Excessive Notifications Fixed: Implemented safeguards to prevent multiple intervals, resolving repeated notifications.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.5 - November 4, 2024\n\nImprovements:\n- Independent Tracking for Message Types: Notifications now separately cover chat, threads, and MoTD updates, ensuring users receive distinct updates for each type without redundancy\n- Formatted Message Display: Notifications now have improved readability.\n- Automatic Tracking Resumption on Update: Tracking state is retained after extension updates, with login prompts if re-authentication is needed.\n\nBug Fixes:\n- Encoding Fix: Special characters display correctly.\n- Retry Mechanism for Message Retrieval: Handles temporary network issues without stopping tracking.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.4 - November 3, 2024\n\nNew Features:\n- Added a \"Clear History\" button that lets users erase all notification history with a single click.\n- Implemented a \"Copy Message\" feature, enabling users to easily copy notifications in a spectrum-friendly preformatted format.\n\nImprovements:\n- The maximum number of tracked users has been increased to 8, providing users with greater flexibility in monitoring key developers.\n- The notification history limit has been increased from 50 to 100 messages, allowing users to retain a more extensive record of past notifications.\n- The following CIG team members have been added to the list of available users for tracking: Swift-CIG, Proxus-CIG\n\nRelease Notes for 1.3 - November 2, 2024\n\nImprovements:\n- Emoji Support: Introduced basic emojis frequently used by CIG and added support for custom emojis from the sc-testing and etf communities.\n- Tab Creation Update: Implemented active: false in all instances of tabs.create for better tab management.\n- Filtering Options: Added filtering by date.\n- User Tracking Update: Increased the tracked users limit to 5 and added Armeggadon-CIG to the list of available users for tracking.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.2 - October 29, 2024\n\nThe issue of excessive new tab spamming has been resolved, along with various other bug fixes to enhance overall performance and stability.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.1 - October 29, 2024\n\nPreviously unidentified critical bug detected; reverting to version 0.8 (1.1 in store) temporarily until the issue with new tab spamming is resolved.\n\nRelease Notes for 1.0 - October 28, 2024\n\nBug Fixes: \nResolved issues with multiple cookie verification tabs opening for some users.
