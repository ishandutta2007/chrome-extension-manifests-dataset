This extension streamlines the process of sourcing reference information for use with language models like ChatGPT.\n\nWorkflow:\nThe extension's workflow is straightforward. Users begin by conducting a search on Google as they normally would. The extension then presents a list of websites from the SERPs, allowing users to manually select the websites they wish to scrape content from.\n\nOnce the desired websites are chosen, the extension navigates through each site and extracts the textual content. The scraped text is then compiled into a single text file, which users can easily copy and paste into language models like ChatGPT.\n\nThe primary purpose of this extension is to provide users with a convenient way to gather reference information from various websites, which can then be used as context or source material for language models to rewrite, summarize, or expand upon. The extension does not analyze the quality of the content, extract images, or include any filtering or formatting options beyond compiling the text into a single file.\n\nBy simplifying the process of gathering relevant textual content from Google SERPs, RAG Content Scraper from Google SERPs empowers users to efficiently source reference information for their language model-based workflows. Whether you're a writer, researcher, or anyone working with language models, this extension offers a streamlined solution for collecting textual data from the web, enabling you to leverage the power of language models more effectively."
