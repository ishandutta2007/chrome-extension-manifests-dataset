Chrome might restore all your tabs from your last session. This extension will unload all those tabs, so you aren't wasting computer resources loading those webpages.\n\nAs soon as you click on an unloaded tab, it will load the webpage as normal.\n\nFirefox browser does this by default, and now, with this extension, you can have this feature in Chrome too.\n\nWhy did I make this?\n\nI didn't like that I would open Chrome and all my tabs would start loading. I don't need all of them to load, I might not even click on most of them. I liked that in Firefox, I didn't need to worry about how many tabs I had open, since I knew when I restarted the browser, none of those tabs would load until I clicked on them (but the tabs were still there, ready to be clicked if I wanted them).\n\nAfter some research, I found that Chrome does have this feature, but it's only available to extensions. So, I created this extension for myself, so I can once again use Chrome with tonnes of tabs open, and not worry about wasting my computer's resources on those tabs.\n\nAdditional Features\n\nBesides unloading all tabs when you open Chrome...\n1) Added a right click menu option: you can click this option and it will unload all your inactive tabs immediately.\n\nThat's it. This is a very lightweight extension. Enjoy :)\n\nNote:\nThis extension only unloads tabs:\na) when you open Chrome, or \nb) when you click the menu item.\nIt doesn't unload tabs at any other time.\n\nPermissions Explained:\n\"Read your browsing history\" - this allows me to search for and select all your inactive tabs, so I can unload them. This extension doesn't look at your browsing history.\n\nCredits:\nThe extension icon, the computer with 3 gears, was created by phatplus on freeicons.io (https://freeicons.io/profile/51091)."
