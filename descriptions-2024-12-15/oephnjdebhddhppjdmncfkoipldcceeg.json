The count down can be extremely motivating and a reminder to get on with tasks that are important to you. \n\nTickytock is fully configurable, you may select which sites you would like the notification to appear on and how often you would like to be notified while browsing a blocked site. It uses data provided by population.io to estimate you life expectancy, these figures should not be taken seriously. Rather just a reminder that the 'Clock is ticking'"
