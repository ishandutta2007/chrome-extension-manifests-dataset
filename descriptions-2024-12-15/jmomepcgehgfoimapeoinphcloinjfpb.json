Zooming can be re-enable on a per-tab basis by clicking the Zoom Block icon.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: What permissions does Zoom Block require?\nA: Zoom Block does not require any permissions. Through careful handling of errors, Zoom Block is able to operate without access to any sensitive information.\n\nQ: Does Zoom Block use analytics?\nA: No. Zoom Block respects its users' privacy. No network requests of any kind are ever made.\n\nQ: Can Zoom Block \"lock\" a custom zoom level?\nA: The browser extension API does not offer an elegant way to accomplish this. The best option is to change the browser's default zoom level. Chrome's default zoom settings can be found in Settings -> Appearance -> Page Zoom. Zoom Block will then prevent modifications to the set level.\n\nQ: Why does Zoom Block's icon sometimes turn gray?\nA: Some browsers do not allow extensions to modify certain pages (typically internal or settings pages). Zoom Block is therefore unable to prevent zooming on those pages, and the icon will turn gray to indicate such a situation.\n\nQ: I found a bug! Where can I submit a report?\nA: Please open an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/warnellw/Zoom-Block/issues) with a detailed description.
