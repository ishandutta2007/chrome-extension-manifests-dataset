Here comes Voice DIM to the rescue. Using a global shortcut (defaulted to Ctrl+Shift+0) or the new Always listening mode (using an activation phrase defaulted to \"okay ghost\"), Voice DIM will now listen for your command and execute it within seconds, even while in the middle of a heated Crucible match or raid encounter.\n\nHere are the voice commands available:\n• Transfer/Equip <weapon name>: Transfer any weapon by name\n• Transfer/Equip <weapon type> + <energy type>: Transfer a weapon by its type and energy\n• Transfer/Equip <weapon name> with <perks>: Transfer a weapon with a particular perk (works with multiple perks)\n• Store <weapon name>: Store a weapon in the vault\n• Loadout <loadout name>: Equip a loadout by name\n• Start Farming Mode: Prevent items from going to the postmaster\n• Stop Farming Mode: End farming mode\n• Max Power: Equip the current character's max power items\n• Collect postmaster: Collect all items from the current character's postmaster\n\nThese commands are now fully configurable! Head to the options page of Voice DIM to setup your own custom voice commands.\n\nCurrent issues:\n• Loadouts with numerics don't match well when requesting them (ex. Loadout 1)\n• The auto rifle Krait doesn't match well because speech recognition gets \"crate\" and matches Fractethyst quite often. Mitigate by using \"transfer K R A I T\"\n\nVisit voicedim.com for more information."
