Reaching the conclusion of each level is the goal as you go through the tunnels while dodging hazards and gaps. The game has several levels of varying difficulties, and as players advance, they may unlock additional characters with various skills.\n\nThe ability to change gravity is one of Run 3 standout features. Players have the option to walk on walls and ceilings by switching between regular gravity and low gravity settings. This makes the gameplay much more challenging and calls for quick reactions and exact timing.\n\nIf you have any questions about our Run 3 Unblocked game extension or just want to give us some feedback, feel free to send us a message or write a review!
