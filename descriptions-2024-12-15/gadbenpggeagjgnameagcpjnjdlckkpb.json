The Cloudfront Purge Tool takes away the hassle of using the AWS API in case you want to quickly purge one or more files.\n\nWondering if is safe to use this tool? Don’t worry.\nThe Cloudfront Purge Tool installs on your local computer and interacts directly with AWS: we are not in between. All information is sent securely over HTTPS. Your AWS Secret is not even sent over the wire (the authenticator is encrypted in the browser), so nobody can possibly ‘grab’ it by sniffing internet traffic. If you want, you can have the app remember your credentials: they will be stored on your computer, in Chrome’s localStorage.\n\n- Do purge requests for all distributions tied to your credentials\n- View the status of the last 20 purge requests\n- Receive a Desktop Notification when the purge is done (can be turned off)\n\nThe source code is available on Github: https://github.com/sajal/Cloudfront-Purge-Tool"
