Sorry about that D:\n\nLet me know if you see any other bugs! Feel free to shoot me an email or open a bug report or leave a review!\n\nAlso, to clarify, the extension does not collect any of your data. It uses the storage function to save your selected colour mode on the extension, or if you have it disabled, so the next time you come to classroom your settings are saved and reapplied.\n\nThis extension will transform your Google Classroom to a way cooler dark version. It is fully functional, but may have areas that were untouched and are being worked on currently.\n\nAll the code used for the dark mode is original, therefore there will be bugs and areas that are not the correct colour, style, etc. Please let me know if there is something that is does not look visually correct."
