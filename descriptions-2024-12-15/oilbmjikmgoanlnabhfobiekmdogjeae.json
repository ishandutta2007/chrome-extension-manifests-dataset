Players begin their journey in a quaint farm town called Grassland, which serves as the central hub. Here, you interact with local ducks, each offering unique races and training exercises that are crucial for honing your duck's abilities in running, flying, climbing, and swimming. The emphasis on training reflects a foundational gameplay element: the better trained your duck, the better it performs in races.\n\nExpanding your team becomes a strategic aspect of the game. Initially selecting from a vibrant array of ducklings, each with distinctive liveries, you can later visit the in-game shop to purchase additional ducks. This introduces a team management dynamic where each duck's unique strengths can be cultivated and utilized in different racing conditions.\n\nIf you have any questions about our Duck Life 4 game extension or just want to give us some feedback, feel free to send us a message or write a review!
