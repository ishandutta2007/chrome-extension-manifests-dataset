Disable the extension and reload the page if you have problems with videos not being displayed properly.\n- Since video controls are not standardized, when entering windowed fullscreen for a video, most often the site's video controls will be removed and replaced with the browser's default video controls, which may or may not work properly.\n- On some websites the video will reset to the start when entering or leaving windowed fullscreen mode.\n\nYou may report websites that are not compatible with this extension, but chances are that it is impossible for me to fix the problem. Please blame the website and not the extension :-)"
