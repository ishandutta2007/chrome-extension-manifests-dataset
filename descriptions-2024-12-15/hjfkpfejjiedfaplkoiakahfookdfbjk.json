While Janus is great for exploring 3D spaces, it takes a lot of set up to actually view anything. That's where the HoloSpace extension comes in. With HoloSpace, you can preview these 3D environments without leaving Chrome. Simply point your browser at a URL that contains FireBox HTML code, tap the extension, and you are presented with a pop-up window into the 3D world. HoloSpace is currently in beta, so it may not work perfectly for every site. Please let don't hesitate to report any bugs so we can improve."
