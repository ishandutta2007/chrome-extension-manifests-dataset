When you start reading an ao3 work, ao3 saver servers will automatically back up the work you're reading. If the story ever goes down, the 404 page you're met with will have a button to take you right to the backup stored on the ao3 saver server.\n\nThe ao3 menu assists in finding lost works by keeping a history of each work you've visited. You can search and find a deleted work your previously viewed with this extension with ease.\n\nNo data on what you view is kept on anything but your local device. Nothing the server stores is attached to you.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any issues or suggestions for this extension. You can contact me at mail@ao3saver.com\n\nI'm planning on keeping the servers up for this extension and continue support for it for years into the future."
