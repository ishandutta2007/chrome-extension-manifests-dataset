Therefore it may be used as a shortcut to find more information quickly on the users FACEIT stats without having to go over to the platform.\n\nExtensions shows data as FACEIT level, elo, premium or not, when was the profile made, how many times the player has been afk, how many times player has left any FACEIT game and if player is banned or not on FACEIT.\n\nIt works on any Steam profile, doesn't matter if it is private or not, as far as the Steam profile has been connected to FACEIT account, it will show data. \n\nIs pretty useful if you want to understand how good the player is before adding him or easily find out if the player is smurf or not and how old is their steam account."
