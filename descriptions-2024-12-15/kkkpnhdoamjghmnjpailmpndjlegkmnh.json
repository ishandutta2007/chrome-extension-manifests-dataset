It allows you to manage multiple users for your account and to share a common set of options for the schemas/tables included in system prompts.\n\nThis extension is open-source, you can find it in Github at https://github.com/RobinPicard/metabase-copilot\n\nContact: metabasecopilot@gmail.com\n\nPS: the sign-in with Google feature is only available for Chrome users. Brave or Chromium users can still use Metabase Copilot, but they have to provide their own OpenAI API key."
