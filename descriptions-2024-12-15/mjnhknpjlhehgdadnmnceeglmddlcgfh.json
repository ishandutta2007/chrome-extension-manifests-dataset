Setup is extremely simple, and there is no need to re-create menus elsewhere. Users can also take advantage of the embed code to put the online menu on their own website. \n\nOrders are immediately sent through to the system; no duplication is necessary. For Colorado operators, an immediate connection to the state MED is also built-in, to check and report purchaser limits. The best feature, however, is the beautiful, easily navigable online menu, which store customers can use on a variety of devices."
