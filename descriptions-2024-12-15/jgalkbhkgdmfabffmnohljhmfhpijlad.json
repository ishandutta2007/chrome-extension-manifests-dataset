The times that you visited the venue may also not be exact. However, it can give you a good estimate of whether you were close to a COVID-19 hotspot.\n\nWhy did we do it? \nWe made this to help you and save time. If this extension has helped you, please consider buying me a coffee. \n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate?business=3BGK2V3G2QHPL&no_recurring=0&item_name=Corona+Doko&currency_code=AUD\n\nThis will help us improve the extension.\n\nSupport\nIf you have any issues please send us an email to:\n corona-doko@googlegroups.com\n\nIssues with the extension:\nIf you are unable to see any data on the map, this might be because:\n1) You did not sign in to the same Google account on Mobile and Desktop. \n2) You do not have the Timeline feature active on your Google Maps.\n\nImportant notes:\nCorona Doko is only supported for users in NSW, Australia. Unfortunately, we do not support other states at this point.\n\nCorona Doko is not a replacement for the NSW Health website or the Service NSW App (check-in).\n\nWe encourage you to use this tool as a way to check if you were near a COVID-19 hotspot. \n\nThis should be an additional tool.\n\n\nTech notes:\n- To prevent any limitations with the Google API, we pull data from your Google Timeline once a day and store a copy of your coordinates in the browser.\n- All the data manipulation happens in your browser. We do not collect or store any data outside of your browser. We do not have any back-end service (API) or data repository.\n\nTerms and Conditions\n- We built this extension to help people find COVID-19 hotspots paired with Google Maps data to determine if they have come into contact with a covid case. Use this extension as an extra tool for the NSW Health office website.\n- We are not responsible for any misuse of the extension or any data lost.\n\nBy downloading this extension, you accept our Terms and Conditions.\n\nHope this extension can help everyone. \n#staysafe #nsw"
