But, sometimes we need to focus on that 1 page we're on; that 1 video we're watching. \n\nWith NoFoMo, you can challenge your brain to reprogram your digital distraction habit. \n\n1. Set a timer. \n2. Start a challenge\n3. Just stay on the tab you're on! You can continue browsing on that one tab. \n\nThe goal is simple - just don't switch to / open up another tab or another window.\n\nHigh Stakes Mode: For serious competitors, turn on \"High Stakes Mode\"! If you lose, we'll randomly close on of your open tabs.\n \nPS: Don't worry, we don't block a tab or a window. We just tally when you get distracted and jump around!"
