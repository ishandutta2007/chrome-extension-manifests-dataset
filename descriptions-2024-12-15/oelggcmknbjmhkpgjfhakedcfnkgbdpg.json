I use it every day for quick edits, product demos and other testing out new ideas.\n\nThe extension options allow you to set a default key command to open and close the editor; turn off the warning that is shown when you close the editor; and enable or disable the automatic saving of your changes when you close the editor.\n\nVersion 1.8.0 includes the following changes:\n - The ability to set a default editor size\n - Warnings and error messages when trying to use the editor in places that it won't work\n - Improved the CSS to make sure it isn't impacted by other page CSS\n - Use the Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts instead of a custom shortcut (BREAKING CHANGE)\n - Code cleanup\n\nVersion 1.7.3 is mostly a version bump for manifest 2 support. It just brings it up to support the latest versions of Chrome.\n\nVersion 1.7 includes:\n - Ability to move the window left / right as well as top / bottom.\n - Support for RTL pages (forces LTR on the editor)\n - Support for tab spacing in the editor\n - other minor bug fixes\n\nVersion 1.6 includes the following:\n - You can now save styles that you create for the pages you visit. When you come back to the page, the new styles will be applied instantly.\n - The editor remembers the size of the editing box on a per url basis. If you've resized it, it will be the same size the next time you open it on that url.\n - Customizations are now saved per URL instead of per domain\n\nVersion 1.5 includes the following updates:\n\n - Support for tabs in the text area\n - Support for https URLs\n - You can disable the warning message\n - It can remember your CSS changes, even after a refresh of the page\n - A keyboard command (ctrl+shift+E) can open and close the editor\n - You can configure the keyboard command in the options\n - The chrome icon is colorized instead of black\n - Faster, smoother operation and cleaner code\n - International Language Support\n\nPlease update and try it out. You can follow @livecsseditor on twitter for updates and feedback. Thanks :)\n\nJeremy Hubert\n\nhttp://twitter.com/livecsseditor\nhttp://twitter.com/jhubert"
