Review Thread Status - Allows you to quickly set or check the status of each review comment thread. As a pull request author, statuses serve as a task list, reducing the amount of work needed to keep reviewers up-to-date. As a pull request reviewer, statuses identify which threads are ready for review and allow you to see threads in context.\n\n2. Actionable Metrics (Early 2023) - Developer-centric metrics that bring the effort, time, and impact of code review to light.\n\n3. Real-time Collaboration (Early 2023) - Code review enhanced with intuitive and familiar real-time features. For every pull request: identifies reviewers (active and inactive) and when and what they are reviewing.\n\n...and many more coming soon.\n\nVisibly strives to make pull requests more efficient, more visible, and less of a black box.\n\nYour feedback and pain points directly drive what we build! We'd love to hear from you."
