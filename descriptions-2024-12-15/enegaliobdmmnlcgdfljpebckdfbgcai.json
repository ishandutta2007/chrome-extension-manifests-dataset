In order to ensure that it doesn't get too annoying, if you scroll on the screen autoscroll will automatically disable for 60 seconds. Unchecking this box will completely stop the autoscrolling feature.\n==============================\n||NEW Feature\n==============================\nYou can now set a key to start/stop the autoscrolling done by this extension. While it will still automatically stop for 30 seconds when you scroll manually, you can now set it to stop until you refresh or start again using this key. \n\nTo stop songs that are too short or too long from playing, simply check those boxes and enter a number in the format of \nHOUR:MINUTE:SECONDS\n\nif you want, you enter only one or two values, it will always assumed that the last value is seconds, the second to last is minutes and the first is hours. Example:\nEntering: \"50\" would mean 50 seconds\nEntering: \"5:50\" would mean 5 minutes and 50 seconds\nEntering: \"3:5:55\" would mean 3 hours 5 minutes and 55 seconds.\n- Please Note: The feature to remove songs based on time will NOT remove them visually from your stream, but will skip them if they come up in your player.\n\nIf you want to only block reposts from specific users:\nUncheck block reposts, \nCheck remove specific users reposts\nType the name of any users you want to block reposts from and refresh the page.\n\nEnjoy your streams!"
