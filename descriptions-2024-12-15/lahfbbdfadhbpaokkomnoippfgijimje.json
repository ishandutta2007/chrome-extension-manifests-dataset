Well, now she can be (sort of)! This extension brings the magic of Hermione's know-it-all personality to your Google searches.\n\nRemember how she playfully corrected Ron's pronunciation of \"Wingardium Leviosa\"? This extension channels that spirit! When you search for something with a typo, Google will normally suggest the correct spelling. But with this extension installed, it'll feel like Hermione herself is setting you straight by overriding that suggestion with her own witty correction.\n\nSo grab your wand (or mouse) and give it a try! It's a fun way to add a touch of Hermione's brilliance to your web searches.\n\nA touch of Harry Potter fun: Show your love for the series and celebrate Hermione's sharp mind with this lighthearted extension.\n\nHave a blast with your new studious companion!"
