If you are one of those people, you're really going to appreciate Omni Go.   If you are not one of those, you'll still find typing a shortcut faster than removing your hand from the keyboard to navigate bookmarks.\n\nThe basic idea is to increase navigation speed by allowing you to quickly navigate your browser without having to remove your hands from the keyboard. \n\nQuick Tips on how to Navigate Chrome \"Mouseless\"\n\n\"ALT D\":     Focus the Chrome's ADDRESS BAR\n\"CTRL T\":  Open a new TAB\n\"CTRL N\":  Open a NEW WINDOW\n\"CTRL F4\":  Close current TAB\n\"ALT F4\":   Close current WINDOW\n\"TAB\":  Shift focus forward on current TAB\n\"SHIFT TAB\":  Shift focus backward on current TAB\n\"CTRL TAB\":  Switch to next Chrome TAB\n\"CTRL SHIFT TAB\":  Switch to previous Chrome TAB \n\"ARROW UP/DOWN\":  Scroll the current TAB\n\"ALT ARROW LEFT/RIGHT\":  BACK/FORWARD page navigation in current TAB\n\"PAGE UP/DOWN\":  PAGE Scroll the current TAB\n\"F5\":  Refresh page on current TAB\n\"CTRL F5\":  Hard Refresh page on current TAB (destroy local cache)\n\nMouse tips:\n\"CTRL CLICK [URL]\": Load link in NEW TAB keep current TAB in focus.\n\"SHIFT CLICK [URL]\":  Load link in NEW WINDOW\n\nWith those shortcuts and the ability to configure OMNI GO keywords (and a little practice), you'll be navigating the internet faster than you've ever thought possible."
