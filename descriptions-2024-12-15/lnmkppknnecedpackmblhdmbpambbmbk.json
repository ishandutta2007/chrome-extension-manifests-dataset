You have full control over which pages you want displayed on your site — turn any page on or off at any time.\n\nYou set the overall look of your entire site by simply selecting a theme template from our ever-growing library of site themes. Scroll through the list of site thumbnail images, click the one you feel best matches the look you want for your site, and every page of your site immediately takes on that look. Change your site's theme at any time with a click of the mouse button. Don't worry about HTML, web design, page formatting, or any of that web programming stuff — the theme template handles everything for you! \n\nLog in to your site's private administration area and use the website builder content management system (CMS) to easily add text and graphics to any page of your site. Here you also quickly and easily list the products you want to sell. Want to add a new product? Click the New button, then type the product's name, description, and price. Optionally click the Upload button to upload any number of images of the product. If you're selling digital files for customers to download, simply provide a file description and price, click the Upload button to upload the file, and you're done. Every addition or change you make is immediately reflected on your site. And it's all \"point, click, and type\" — there's never any HTML or programming involved. There's no software to download, and you can edit your site at any time from any computer using any web browser! \n\nThe included website builder comes with many built-in pages — preformatted pages, each serving a particular purpose. If you'd like your website to include a Contact Us page, you've got it. Just use the administration text boxes to type as little or as much contact information as you want, then click a check box to have the formatted page, in a style that matches your website's overall theme, included in your website's navigation menu (or uncheck the check box to temporarily or permanently hide that page). Follow those simple steps to add About Us, Testimonials, FAQ, and other pages. \n\nIf you have videos you'd like your visitors to watch, upload them to your website's Video page where they automatically appear in a movie list. When a visitor selects a video, it plays in the built-in movie player. Upload videos in a variety of file formats, including swf (Flash), wmv, asf and mpg. If you have music you'd like to share, upload the songs to your website's Music page. Uploaded songs appear in a list from which a visitor makes a selection in order to have the song play in the built-in player. Upload music files in formats such as wma, mp3, aiff, wav and midi. The Music page is perfect for musicians selling downloadable music — here you can provide visitors with short samples of the songs you sell. If you don't want to include videos or music on your site, simply turn off these optional pages. \n\nAny time you add a new product (or edit an existing product), the changes are automatically recognized by the shopping cart that's fully integrated into your site &mdash there's never any work to do to keep your site's shopping cart up to date. When a visitor at your site is interested in a product you sell, that customer clicks the Add To Cart button that appears by the product's name. That adds the product to your site's shopping cart. The customer can add and remove items at any time, and can check out to make the purchase at any time. Whether you sell products you ship to the customer, files the customer downloads, or both, the shopping cart handles it all! \n\nAfter a customer at your site has added one or more or your site's products to your site's shopping cart, the customer checks out to pay you. The customer is taken to a PayPal page where the customer can choose to pay by a major credit card such as MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover, or by debit card or PayPal. No matter what payment method the customer picks, PayPal handles the transaction and deposits the money directly into your free PayPal account! Having PayPal handle all transactions means you don't need to buy a costly merchant account. It also means you don't have to submit to the credit check that normally accompanies being able to accept credit card purchases."
