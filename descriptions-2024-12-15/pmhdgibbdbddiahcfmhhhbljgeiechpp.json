This feature allows you to write, edit, and save your personal prompts or the responses generated by ChatGPT in an intuitive interface.\n\nThe title and content of each note are fully customizable and can be grouped into lists created by yourself. These lists act like folders, enabling easy and efficient organization of your notes. The arrangement of notes within a list and the lists themselves can be modified thanks to a drag-and-drop feature, offering great flexibility.\n\nIn addition to creating new notes, you can also turn any chat message block into a note with a simple click on the 'NOTE' button. This greatly facilitates the preservation of important prompts or interesting responses from ChatGPT.\n\nThe extension also offers customization options, including the ability to change the graphic theme of the interface.\n\nWith unlimited local storage for your notes and lists, \"Notes for ChatGPT\" provides all the space you need for managing your prompts and essential information.\n\nThe Notes for ChatGPT extension transforms your ChatGPT experience into a dynamic and customizable workspace, making chat sessions more productive and organized."
