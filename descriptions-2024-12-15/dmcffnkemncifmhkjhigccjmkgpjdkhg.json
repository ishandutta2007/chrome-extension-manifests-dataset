EvaluationKIT Removal Tool is here to help you hide those pesky reminders.\n\nThis tool hides the reminder pop-up that appears in Moodle.  Please keep in mind that course evaluations provide valuable feedback and analytics to your school and instructor.  You should complete them at your earliest convenience.\n\nI created this extension because many schools, mine included, disable the \"close\" button when you get down to the last few days in the semester.  This is intrusive behavior and forces students to complete the evaluations before continuing to their course content.  This invalidates any statistics the school publishes or uses that originate or contain analytics from EvaluationKIT."
