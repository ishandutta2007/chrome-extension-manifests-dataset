In the traditional way, we have to copy and paste the text into each input box of the form one by one, which is time-consuming, laborious, and error-prone. With the Fast Fill Chrome extension, we can easily fill in all the input boxes of the form with a large amount of text at once, greatly improving efficiency and accuracy.\n\nSpecifically, the Chrome extension can achieve this function through the following steps:\n1. Open the form page that needs to be filled in the browser.\n2. Click the Chrome extension icon, enter the text that needs to be filled in the pop-up extension window. Fast Fill will automatically divide the text into different input box contents.\n3. Click the \"Fill into the form\" button, and the extension will automatically fill in all the form input boxes with the text at once, eliminating the trouble of filling them in one by one."
