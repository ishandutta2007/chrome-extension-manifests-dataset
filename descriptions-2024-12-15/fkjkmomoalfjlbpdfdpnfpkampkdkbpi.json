If a community member has submitted a section of video that may have gore, profanity, sexual content, other mature content, etc, then other community members may enable that type of content to be blocked out during playback. This is NOT AI driven. Timespan entries are 100% based on the community. Users may use the extension without creating an account but must have an account to submit an entry."
