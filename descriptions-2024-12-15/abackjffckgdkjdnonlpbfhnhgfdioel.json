Easily search across web content and files & emails.\n\nMultiSearch - a personalized, extended search\nSidebar mirrors each web search you do with a search of your documents, files, messages and browsed pages. So you’ll always find what you need.\n\nLearns as you work\nTags automatically show how each page relates to your digital life. And Dokkio learns as you browse, suggesting new tags for you.\n\nKeeps you up to speed\nOne click shows all the important changes to your content.
