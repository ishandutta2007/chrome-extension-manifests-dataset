There are two types of people who should use it:\n\n1. If you send cold email or email marketer sending campaigns through Gmail, you want accurate open tracking. Right now if you use a platform like GMass, YAMM, Mailshake, or Lemlist for example, and you open your own email from your Sent folder, or you open a bounce notification, the open-tracking pixel will fire, causing a false open to be registered in your campaign reports. This extension will stop those \"false opens\" from registering.\n\nNote that right now, the extension only blocks open tracking pixels from GMass. In time, it will block pixels of the aforementioned platforms as well.\n\n2. If you're a privacy advocate who doesn't want \"opens\" to be registered on emails that are sent by email marketing platforms.\n\nThis extension was developed by the makers of GMass, so use case #1 is the primary target.\n\nNote that this extension is being released under the new Chrome Manifest V3 program, so it uses the latest technology from Chrome to block email tracking pixels. There are other extensions that perform similar functionality, like Ugly Email and PixelBlock, but these haven't been updated in years and will stop working soon because they're written in Manifest V2, which is being deprecated soon."
