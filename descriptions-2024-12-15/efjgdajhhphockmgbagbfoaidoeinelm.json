It does not send the content to any external server.\n\nlightmd is designed to be lightweight, not feature rich, while still providing some flexibility as a scratchpad.\n\nPreview supports three styles, None (browser default rendering), Github (inspired), and a custom lightmd style (seen in screenshot).\n\nlightmd allows for export to .md, HTML, and printing directly from the preview frame (must hit the Print button, not Ctrl+P).\n\nThe extension stores your content while you type in the browsers local storage. It has 4 \"slots\" which can be swapped between as you wish.\n\nNB! Wiping browser local storage will wipe the contents stored in these editors!\n\nlightmd uses a JavaScript library for converting Markdown to HTML (markdown-js), which has some limitations. It only supports basic Markdown and does not support inline HTML.\n\nlightmd is open source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/jorgenys/lightmd"
