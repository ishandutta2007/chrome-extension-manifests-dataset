If Infinite Scroll is enabled, the page will automatically display the next \"page\" of items as you scroll down.\n\nSort items by clicking the header cells. Only items currently displayed on the page will be sorted. To sort the entire market history, first click the View All button, then sort the results.\n\nHighlight items according to transaction type to make them easier to spot. Hide transaction types you do not want to see-- they will not appear on the page or in any search results.\n\nItem names can be clicked to go to their item page in the community market.\n\nItem icons can be clicked to show only market history transactions involving that specific item, while hiding all others. Click the item icon again to show all transactions.\n\nSearch will search in item name and description over your entire market history. Transaction types configured to be hidden will remain hidden.\n\n\"NOT\" can be used to exclude items from search, e.g. \"Trading Card NOT Foil\" will return all trading cards excluding foils. \n\n\"price:\", \"price:>\", and \"price:<\" can be used to search by price, e.g. \"price:0.50\" will find all items priced at 0.50, \"price:>9.99\" will find all items priced over 9.99, \"price:<1.00\" will find all items priced under 1.00. \n\nRegular Expressions can be used by enclosing the entire query with \"/\", e.g. \"/Final.*XI{0,3}/\"\n\nShow Net Gain/Loss applies only to items currently displayed on the page. This allows you to see the worth of filtered items. For example, search for \"Trading Card\" to see total profit/loss obtained through trading cards."
