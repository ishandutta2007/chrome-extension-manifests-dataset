When you log in, you gain the ability to effortlessly upload, delete, and download files. It's important to note that we take your data privacy seriously.\n\nHere's how data will be stored in a decentralized manner on nodes within the Swarm network:\n\nData Distribution: When you upload a video, it gets broken down into smaller chunks. These data chunks are then distributed across various nodes within the Swarm network. Each node stores a portion of the video data.\n\nRedundancy: To ensure data durability and availability, Swarm employs redundancy. This means that multiple copies of your data chunks are stored across different nodes. Even if one node goes offline or becomes inaccessible, your data remains retrievable from other nodes.\n\nDecentralized Control: Unlike centralized storage solutions, where a single entity has control over your data, Swarm operates on a decentralized network. No single party has complete control over the data, enhancing security and reducing the risk of data misuse.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Retrieval: When you or others want to access the stored video, your client retrieves the necessary data chunks directly from the Swarm network, making it a peer-to-peer process. This reduces the reliance on centralized servers.\n\nNow, it's crucial to emphasize our commitment to your data privacy:\n\nWe do not save or utilize your data for any purpose other than facilitating its storage and retrieval within the Swarm network. Your data remains securely distributed across the decentralized network, and we do not engage in data mining, tracking, or any form of data monetization. Our primary focus is on providing you with a reliable and privacy-conscious platform for video storage and management.\n\nIf you have any concerns or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team at https://video.wiki/contact-us. Your privacy and satisfaction are our top priorities."
