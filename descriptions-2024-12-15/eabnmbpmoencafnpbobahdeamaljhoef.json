Support me at https://www.patreon.com/MangaReader276\n\n**What Does this Extension Offer?**\n\nThis extension offers a unique approach to manga/manhwa/manhua translation and Japanese/Korean/Chinese learning:\n\n1. **Side-by-side translation**: Unlike existing manga translation tools that simply replace Japanese text with English, this extension allows you to see the original Japanese text alongside the translated text. This feature provides a learning opportunity by enabling you to compare and understand the language in its original form. First click on the extension icon or use a keyboard shortcut to initiate cropping. Then crop the text bubble or the phrase to be translated. Feel free to toggle to see the original text to ensure that OCR (Optical Character Recognition) identifies the correct text to be translated.\n\n2. **AI-powered Tutor**: While the extension offers conventional translation, it also provides the option to harness the power of a large language model. This cutting-edge feature breaks down sentences or phrases into easily digestible words or compound words, along with their translations. This approach enables a deeper understanding of the context and nuances within the text.\n\n3. **Not just manga**: You can use this for manhwa and manhua as well since Korean and Chinese are also supported! You can also use this on other platforms like Youtube or Netflix subtitles!\n\n**Try it out yourself**\n\n0. Pin the extension\n1. Go to https://shonenjumpplus.com/episode/4856001361458138514  \n2. Right click the extension icon to open the options page from the menu\n3. Sign in with google account\n4. Feel free to change the other options\n5. Go back to the manga\n6. Click on the extension icon to start cropping.\n7. Crop any text bubbles\n8. (optional) switch between gpt/deepl on the options page. Choose the former if you want in depth translation. Choose the latter if you want a quicker translation\n9. (optional) choose different capture modes that best suit your reading needs. Single is the most reliable at the moment. Multiple works best on large manga panels or an entire page.\n10. (optional) switch between the supported languages on the options page.\n11. (optional) enter you own GPT key for faster translations. The key is local to your browser and will not be uploaded to any servers. (This can be publicly verified in the client code.)\n\n**Important note**\n\nThis is an early prototype. Depending on how many users find this idea useful, I will work on polishing it and adding new features. Please send me feature requests and bugs and I will do my best to fix them. Sometimes the first translation might take a while because the server restarts. Thanks for your patience!"
