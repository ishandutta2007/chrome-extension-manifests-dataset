Mutable helps you mute unwanted content across multiple sites at once. Just pick the keywords you want to hide and Mutable will blur, hide, or replace any posts it finds containing those terms!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Control what you see (and what you don't) across multiple social media sites at once!\n- Create keyword mute lists that work across Twitter/X, Facebook, Mastodon, Reddit, Threads, Bluesky, and more!\n- Choose between blurring out posts, blurring with a preview, or hiding them altogether\n- You can even replace posts with cute images of kittens, puppies, or hedgehogs for that additional serotonin!\n\nMutable is still being developed and I would love to hear from you. For questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to reach out!"
