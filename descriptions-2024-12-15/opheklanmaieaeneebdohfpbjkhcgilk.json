The extension opens a new tab in your chrome browser. Choose a local directory and watch your pictures and images.\n\nThe idea behind that extension was to bring local images via Chromecast on your HDTV. Since the Chrome browser is able to share a tab via Chromecast, all you need is a powerful webpage that is able to scan a local directory, parses the image file in it and present them in a nice way.\n\nLocal Gallery Viewer uses the free jQuery-Plugin SuperBGImage by Andreas Eberhard (http://dev.andreaseberhard.de/jquery/superbgimage/) for presentation. You can open or drag'n'drop local folders from you harddrive diretly into the webpage, share the tab via Chromecast and enjoy local images on your HDTV.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Is it possible to hide the controls?\nA: Yes. Click the logo to minimize the controlpanel. As soon as you move your mouse away the controlpanel will fade out.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nVersion 1.2\n23.10.2013: Improve handling with larger number of images (>100)\n\nVersion 1.3\n23.10.2013: new option for exclude subfolders while parsing files in the chosen local folder\n\nVersion 1.4\n24.10.2013: option page added to change the background style of the gallery"
