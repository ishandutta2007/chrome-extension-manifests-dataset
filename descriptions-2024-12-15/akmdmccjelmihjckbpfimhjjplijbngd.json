I made some improvements lately and  thought I might as well publish it.\n\nYou can view the extension page by going to the options page of the extension. Then you can browse to a folder and add a bookmark to it for easy access.\n\nCurrently supported domains: Direct image links, DeviantArt, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Pixiv and a few more.\nIf you'd like other ones, make a contribution or get in touch and I'll see what I can do!\n\nNote: In order to fetch Pixiv images, you need to log in with your account in the top right corner (a requirement of their API)\n\nSource: https://github.com/RvanderLaan/BookmarkImageBrowser"
