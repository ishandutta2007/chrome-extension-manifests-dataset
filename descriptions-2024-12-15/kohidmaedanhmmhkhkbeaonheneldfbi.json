To put it simply, itâ€™s an easy way to organise your Zendesk tickets!\nZest will allow you to customize your ticket view by allowing you to personally colour code your tickets. Not only by the standard priority (low-high), but by any field/category.\n\nHow do you use Zest? Simply click the icon on the top right of your chrome browser, type in the category you want coloured, choose a colour and click add. Refresh your Zendesk page to see the changes take effect.\nChanging the colour of a category is easy too, just click on the colour next to the category name, change it and refresh the Zendesk page.\n\nHow does Zest work? It changes the styling of the page to add a background to each row to the colour that you choose. It does not modify the functionality of the site.\n\nGot more questions? Feel free to contact me for any questions or concerns for yourself or for your business.\n\nEnjoy using Zest?\nPlease consider leaving a rating on the extension so it can reach out to more people.\nAlso consider supporting me via paypal.me/NevGZCC"
