We aim to fix that. \n\n\"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" is a user rights initiative to rate and label website terms & privacy policies, from very good (Class A) to very bad (Class E).\n\nThis extension shows this rating for rated websites by an unintrusive icon in the address bar. You can click on this icon to get a list with the most important rated points of the website's term of services. Additional the extension will warn you when you visit for the first time a website with a bad rating.\n\nOptionally you can notify companies for their grades by sharing on Twitter, if you do not like this feature, simply head over the settings and hide the share button.\n\nThis extension is open source. You can report bugs or propose new features at https://github.com/tosdr/browser-extensions."
