Well now you can change the color with only a few simple clicks\n\nHow to use \n\nDownload the extension \nClick the Enabled Box\nSelect the colors you want easily with your computers default color picker\nThen click \"save changes\" and the color will change \nIt's that simple\n\nVersion 3.0\nBug fixes\nPS the code is really messy and poorly optimized as this is one of the first extensions I had ever written and I will do a complete rewrite of it when I get the chance for the next update. Hopefully 3.0 fixed an installation issue some users were facing but don't worry this poor state is only temporary and Version 4.0 should be much better so stay posted and I hope you like the extension :)"
