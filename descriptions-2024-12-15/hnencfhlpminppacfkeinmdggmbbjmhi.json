Created by the developer behind ShadowDork.com, this extension is designed to streamline your gameplay by seamlessly connecting your ShadowDork.com character sheet with the Roll20 virtual tabletop platform.\n\nThrough a simple and non-intrusive interface, it allows you to share your characters' dice rolls and spell details directly in the chat window of your Roll20 session. The extension operates by capturing events from your ShadowDork character sheet and transmitting them to any Roll20 browser tabs.\n\nA Roll20 account is currently required for use. \n\nLooking ahead, potential future updates could broaden the compatibility with other platforms and Shadowdark tools.\n\nOne feature of the ShadowDork Extension is that it doesn't handle or store any user data, focusing solely on the transmission of game-related events from one browser tab to another.\n\nFor any inquiries or support, you can reach out directly to me, the developer, at contact@ShadowDork.com.\n\nGive the ShadowDork Extension a try and enjoy a seamless transition of your Shadowdark character actions on Roll20. I'm here to support your gameplay, making every roll count."
