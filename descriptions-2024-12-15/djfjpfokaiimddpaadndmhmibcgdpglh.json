This extension makes it easier to view them by loading them all at once. To use this extension, simply navigate to a Patreon post and click the button on the toolbar.\n\nThere are more features planned such as displaying likes and sorting posts by votes and date. If you have suggestions or want to help develop a feature, contact me.\n\nThis extension will probably be removed if Patreon makes their comment system better."
