Points Path is the first award flight search engine that provides both the cash price and the points price of every flight in a Google Flights search. \n\nUsing Points Path is easy. Just install it and then search for your trip as you normally would on Google Flights. In addition to getting Google’s regular cash results, Points Path will add the current points or miles price to each flight (when available) and then let you know which is the better deal.\n\nAnd when you’re ready to book a flight, click through to the normal Google Flights booking page, where you’ll find the option to book with your points directly with the airline (via Points Path) right next to all the usual cash options. Points Path is an all-in-one solution that ensures you’re always getting the best deal for travel, no matter how you pay."
