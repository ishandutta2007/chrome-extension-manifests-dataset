Your messages will still be stored on the chat service database you're using but they'll be a ciphertext and only you and your partner will be able to decrypt them.\n\nPrerequisites:\n1. Both users (you and your chat partner) need to have this plugin installed!\n\nGetting started:\n1. Right click on a chat message input and select \"Cryptify -> Start secret conversation\".\n2. You'll be prompted to type in your partner's conversation name. This is important because you may have multiple chat partners, so make sure you remember who is who!\n3. Once that's done, the output will be auto-pasted into the input you selected in step 1. If it doesn't appear - simply paste in the chat input, Cryptify has already filled in your clipboard!\n4. Send that message to your partner. If he hasn't used this plugin before he'll need to initialize it (once he receives the msg) by right clicking and selecting \"Cryptify -> Scan current page\" . He should receive a prompt to accept and name his conversation partner (you). After that all that is left is for him to simply paste in the chat input and send the output to you.\n5. Awesome, a handshake is complete! You're all set up!\n\nUsing the tool:\n1. Type in a message as you normally would in the chat message box (input).\n2.  Select the text and right-click on your mouse and select \"Cryptify -> Cryptify\".\n3. Your message will be now replaced with the encrypted one. Don't worry if you see no change, we're auto decryptying the text too so what you see is the already encrypted text.\n4. Send your message! It will be auto-decrypted for you partner, you only need to manually encrypt the messages!\n\nPlease see the screenshots."
