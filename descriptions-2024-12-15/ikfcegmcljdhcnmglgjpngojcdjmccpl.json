This is also known as the \"Crossover Point\", where your money is earning the amount you can live off of each year.  Simply enter your desired target amount and the calculator will automatically adjust the number of years of compounding and monthly contribution to show you how long it will take to reach your goal. This can be a helpful tool for setting financial targets and making a plan to achieve them. \n\nWith Investment Compound, you can easily see the potential return on your investments and make informed decisions about your financial future."
