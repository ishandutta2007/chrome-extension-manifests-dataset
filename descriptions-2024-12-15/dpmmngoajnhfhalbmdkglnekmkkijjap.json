I understand their decision, but it's something that I really wanted (and I think some other Pushbullet fans would be interested too), so I made a Chrome extension that allows this behaviour.\n\nThis extension allows the Pushbullet browser extension to show phone notifications, even if the desktop app is also installed. To turn on/off notifications in the browser extension, set it in the extension's options, and to turn on/off notifications in the desktop app, use the desktop app's options. It's that simple. :)\n\nGitHub repository: https://github.com/DChiuch/Bring-Pushbullet-Notifications-Back-to-Chrome"
