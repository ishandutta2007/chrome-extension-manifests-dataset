If you want to repeat a project, this extension will copy most of the information into a new project as your starting point.  Then you can update the details as you like for your new project.\n\nView a project you want to copy and click the extension in the browser toolbar. If you haven't yet authorized the extension to work on your behalf, there will be a sign in button.  After signing in, you'll see a button to copy the project.  If successful, the copied project will open in a new tab or window.\n\nYour stash is updated when copying one of your own projects using stashed yarn. If copying someone else's project that includes stashed yarn, basic information about the yarn is included in the new project, but it is not added to your stash. (Of course this has no effect on the other person's stash.)"
