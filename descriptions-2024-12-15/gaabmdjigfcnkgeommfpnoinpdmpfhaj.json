I am working on solutions, but this is a free application, and I have a job.\n\nThis extension allows users to download sections of a Twitch VOD within the browser.\nNow supports viewing deleted VODs from within the browser.\nNew feature updates demo: https://youtu.be/i3tNqo3SZN8\n\nDeleted VOD recovery is always going to be a shot in the dark. There will be missing segments and sometimes the VOD will not be available at all. No VODs are available after 60 days. Very few are available after 14 days. \nIf you are getting a hangup on \"getting recent stream data\" for more than one minute -- contact me directly with the channel information and the specific VOD, and I will attempt to troubleshoot the issue.\n\nVersion 2.29 update: (19 Sep 2024)\n1) partial patch bringing back SOME functionality on the \"recent streams\" option. \n\nVersion 2.28 update: (8 Jan 2024)\n1) Added chat history for VODs which HAVE NOT been deleted/unpublished. Deleted/unpublished chats will NOT be available.\n\nVersion 2.27 update: (6 Jan 2024)\n1) Small patch which will fix SOME of the issues with retrieving streams.\n\nVersion 2.26 update: (26 Dec 2023)\n1) Fixed bug introduced in v2.25 that caused miscount in segments.\n2) Information update on \"find recent vods\" option.\n\nVersion 2.25 update: (23 Dec 2023)\n1) Fixed bug introduced in v2.24 that caused full VOD downloads to fail.\n2) Small UI bugfix on the progress download indicator.\n\nVersion 2.24 update: (22 Dec 2023)\n1) Fixed VOD selection clipping issue where selection timing did not align.\n\nVersion 2.23 update: (18 Dec 2023)\n1) Bug fixes and minor UI changes.\n2) Changed video output to m4v file to help with loading into video editor tools.\n\nVersion 2.22 update: (21 Oct 2023)\n1) Added ability to seek in video viewer by 10 seconds. Shift+ArrowUp will go forward 10 seconds and Shift+ArrowDown will go back 10 seconds.\n\nVersion 2.19 updates: (4 July 2023)\n1) Fixed some UI bugs related to displaying the stream date\n2) Added discord invite link to menu (discord.gg/sSJsqjKyYg)\n\nVersion 2.17 updates: (2 Jul 2023)\n1) Fixed issue with retrieving recent VODs\n2) Added donation button\n\nVersion 2.16 updates: (25 Jan 2023)\n1) Changed download to mp4 format\n2) Video player now attempts to find the first valid VOD segment before playing. This fixes the hang-up when a deleted VOD is available but has missing segments. This is just a partial fix. It will drop you where the first valid segment exists, but it will not skip over missing segments.\n3) Changed the UI behavior. Hovering over the button no longer pulls up the menu. Clicking now opens the menu and you can click from there for further actions.\n\nVersion 2.14 updates: (22 Nov 2022)\n1) UI improvements\n\nVersion 2.12 updates: (21 Nov 2022)\n1) Fixed bug introduced in 2.11 where livestream download segment selection caused failure. \n2) Added UI notices for why a VOD is failing to download for the leech bed blobs who complain about free software not holding their hand.\n\nVersion 2.11 updates: (16 Nov 2022)\n1) Added ability to pull stream with streamcharts or twitchtracker stream link \n2) UI changes\n3) refactoring and bug fixes\n\nVersion 1.26 updates: (6 Nov 2022)\nReversion to v1.24 due to stability issues in 1.25\n\nVersion 1.25 updates: (5 Nov 2022)\n    1) Added ability to watch current stream within the VOD viewer. Using this to view the current live stream bypasses ads. This approach is a bit choppy and will have a 10-15 second delay from the stream.\n    2) Added ability to slow and speed up video player from 0.1x to 3.0x\n    3) Added ability select quality options on VOD Viewer including audio only\n\nVersion 1.24 updates: (28 Oct 2022)\n    1) Added resolution download options to deleted VODs\n    2) Bug fixes from 1.23 updates\n\nVersion 1.23 updates: (27 Oct 2022)\n    1) Added ability to play VOD from within the individual VOD download section. This allows one to bypass ads and view sub-only VODs.\n    2) Added ability to one-click skip to the unmuted portion of a VOD while in the VOD viewer.\n    3) Fixed issue with muted audio being deleted from be download\n    4) Fixed issue with being unable to watch VODs with muted sections\n\nVersion 1.22 updates: (26 Oct 2022)\n    1) Added ability to view the 20 most recent streams regardless of if the VODs were deleted.\n    2) Fixed issue with not being able to download sub only VODs (can only download if the VOD was recent)\n\nVersion 1.20 updates: (25 Oct 2022)\n    1) bug fixes and small UI updates. \n\nVersion 1.19 updates: (24 Oct 2022)\n    1) Added ability to download the 20 most recent streams regardless of if the VODs were deleted. This can be run from the main channel or the videos section of a stream but not within a specific VOD.\n\nVersion 1.18 updates: (20 Oct 2022)\n    1) Bugfix - audio-only download was broken from changes in v1.17\n\nVersion 1.17 updates: (17 Oct 2022)\n    1) Added ability to download current stream\n\nVersion 1.16 updates: (12 Oct 2022)\n    1) Added ability to download an audio only file\n    2) Filename download now includes the date of the VOD\n\nVersion 1.15 updates:\n    1) Improved video slider selection\n    2) selections can be manually entered within the slider labels\n    3) fixed issue with the button failing to load on navigation\n\nVersion 1.14 updates:\n    1) added ability to select video quality\n    2) user interface is now proportional to the width of the current window"
