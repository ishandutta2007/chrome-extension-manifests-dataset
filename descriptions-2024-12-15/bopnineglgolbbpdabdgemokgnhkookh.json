Why Not Automate Them!\n\nOur tool uses a .txt file of prompts that can be inputted and automated throughout time on Leonardo.Ai\n\n\n\nHOW THE TOOL WORKS - \n1. Use GPT/yourself to create a prompt list and export that prompt list in a .txt file. \n\n2. in the txt file separate each prompt with a  /  symbol For example if you are to have 3 prompts your prompt list file would look like this: \nprompt1 / prompt2 / prompt 3/\n\n3. you do not need any numbering in your prompt list, only the slash to only separate each prompt.\n\n4. Once you upload your .txt you must now set your seconds parameters. a max and a min, this will create a average duration between each prompt submission.\n\n5, Congrats! Its completed. \n\n\n\nWhy use GPT for Your Prompt Creation?\nSpeed, Usability. \nYou can instruct GPT to include the slash symbol at the end of each prompt, you can ask for customizations, and you can also easily export the prompts into a txt file."
