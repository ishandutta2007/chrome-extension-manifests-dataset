You are consuming the information, rather than letting the timeline do all the spoon-feeding. You can decide to read 20 tweets or browse 15 posts , and then get back to work.\n\nYou already know how many people you followed, now you'll also know how many posts that are created every day on your timeline, and assess if it's reasonable to browse all of them."
