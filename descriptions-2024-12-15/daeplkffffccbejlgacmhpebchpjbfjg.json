This extension allows you to choose exactly what you want to see or hide when you're solving LeetCode problems. You can show/hide things like:\n- Completion Status*\n- Acceptance Rate\n- Difficulty\n- Locked Questions\n- Announcements\n- Problem Search Result Count\n- Solved Problem Difficulty Counts\n\nThis extension also adds a Notes panel to the LeetCode problem page. So you can write notes as you write up a solution and browse all your notes at a later time!\n\n* The completion status will also keep a local record of the questions you complete while the extension is installed. This way, if you've come back to LeetCode after a long time or want to start fresh, you can clear all the completion data and start fresh!"
