The extension allows the user the quick option to review some important terms, how they’re rated, easy to understand summaries, and straight forward links to the website’s privacy policy and terms of service. The user can see the rating for each of the summaries they are reviewing and can assess for themselves whether or not that is a website they would be comfortable using."
