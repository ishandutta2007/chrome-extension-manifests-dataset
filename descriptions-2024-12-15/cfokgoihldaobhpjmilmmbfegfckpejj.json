Tired of seeing those pesky Twitter Blue users dominating your timeline? Say no more! With our delightful extension, you can now wave goodbye to Twitter Blue chaos and enjoy a pure, unblemished Twitter feed.\n\n\"BlockTheBlue\" works its magic by automatically blocking Twitter Blue users, ensuring that their posts vanish from your timeline faster than you can say \"tweet.\" But wait, there's more! We understand that some of your favorite accounts might have joined the Twitter Blue brigade, so we've got your back. With our nifty extension, you can whitelist the Twitter Blue users you already follow, so you won't miss out on their tweets.\n\nOh, and did we mention our soft spot for legacy verified users? We know they hold a special place in your heart, so we made sure our extension steers clear of blocking them. After all, they're Twitter royalty, and we wouldn't want to dethrone them, would we?\n\nSo why wait? Install \"BlockTheBlue\" now and reclaim your Twitter timeline! We're all about keeping things lighthearted and fun, because, let's face it, we just can't handle those Twitter Blue users anymore. It's time to make Twitter great again, one tweet at a time!"
