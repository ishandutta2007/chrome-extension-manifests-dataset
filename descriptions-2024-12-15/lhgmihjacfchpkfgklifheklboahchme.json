Some say it is also the funniest.\n\nOur code is open-source, so you can be sure that your browsing activity is not being tracked: https://github.com/abizzaar/blockparty\n\nTo block a website, download the extension and click on the pink party parrot extension icon in your toolbar. Then, add a fragment of the URL you want to block to the blocklist. For example, you’ll want to type “instagram” instead of “https://instagram.com” or other formulations. All URLs containing the fragment “instagram” will now be blocked.\n\nThat’s all. Now block away. Know that whatever you choose to block, you are part of the family. Welcome to the Block Party."
