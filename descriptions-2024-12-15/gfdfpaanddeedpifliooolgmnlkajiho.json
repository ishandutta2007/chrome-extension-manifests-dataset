Though the extension will pre-fill suggested tasks during the first load, users are able to remove these and/or add their own. Checked status is saved, along with the entire task list, so if you have to stop in the middle of your dailies you can easily come back to them.\n\nAdditionally, the extension enlarges the game canvas, making everything easier to see.\n\nFuture versions will allow users to set up interval timers for each task, view reference materials, and more."
