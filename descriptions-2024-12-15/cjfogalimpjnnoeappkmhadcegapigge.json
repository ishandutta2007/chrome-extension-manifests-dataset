Bring your own phone (BYOP) and use this extension to send a text message with 2 clicks (or just 1)! No more copying and pasting numbers and messages from the Open Virtual Phone Bank page.\n\nTurboBYOP places a new button on the Open Virtual PhoneBank contact page. Clicking that button sets up a formatted message on your message application of choice with the phone number filled in. All you need to do is  click send.\n\nGetting TurboBYOP set up takes less than <2 minutes â€” no account or mobile app needed. You will just setup the extension, configure a message template, and log in to your EveryAction Open Virtual PhoneBank. \n \nTurboBYOP is based on the TurboVPB chrome browser extension developed by Evan Schwartz. We are indebted to Evan for pioneering this approach. By forking the TurboVPB code we had a base that we could customize for BYOP needs. \n\nWhile this was developed for Field Team 6's BYOP initiative, other voter registration/GOTV organization are welcome to use it. Please send us a note or leave a review if you are such an organization using it. We would love to hear from you. \n\nIf you find TurboBYOP helpful, please leave a review and consider supporting the ongoing development and maintenance of the extension by sending us an email at    \n\n                       info4omus+turbobyop@gmail.com."
