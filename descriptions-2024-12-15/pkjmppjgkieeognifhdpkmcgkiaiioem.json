We just put it in the top-left menu and removed the big thumbnails to make room for the wallpaper.\n\nThe main features \"en brief\":\n\n* 65 hand-picked high quality images\n* Randomly selected wallpaper for each new tab\n* Links to most visited, bookmarks, history and more (you can choose which one to show/hide)\n* Clean and simple interface -- just the wallpaper and the small menu on top (if you decide to keep it)\n* Works offline (no internet required, images are part of the extension so it will not eat your bandwidth)\n\nPermissions:\n\n* Replace the page you see when opening a new tab (we need this permission because we have to change the current new tab page and start showing the wallpapers instead)\n* Read the list of your most visited pages (required in order to show you the \"Most Visited\" menu)"
