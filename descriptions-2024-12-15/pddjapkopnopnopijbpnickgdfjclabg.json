Credit to Gr√©goire Geis - https://gist.github.com/71/7296ec9d44af7d0f1fb36b053bbe2219.\n\n----- Description -----\n\nHaving trouble taking attendance? Frustrated that you have to take it every single day manually during class?\n\nThis extension lets you take attendance in Google Meet with the click of a button! Everything is integrated with times and days of the week, so you don't have to re-enter names, and everything syncs automatically.\n\nWhy is this better than any other extension, you ask? Well, this extension allows you to have a different schedule for each day of the week. Everything rotates from one time to the next during the day, and one day to the next throughout the week. Set it up once, and you're done!\n\nAfter installation, click the extension logo to edit your days and schedule. From here, you can copy all the student names and times from one day to another if need be, or you can manually add classes and times.\n\nWhen in a Google Meet, just click the button at the top of your screen that says \"Fast Attendance\", and you can see who is present, who is absent, and who is not recognized from the attendance list and Google Meet. The extension will do the work for you by taking the appropriate list of students, based on the current day of the week and time of the day, and comparing it to the list of students in the Google Meet.\n\nNote that no data is sent anywhere - it is confidential to devices with your google account logged in only.\n\nUploading students from Google Classroom is not implemented yet, but possibility for the future!\n\nQuestions? Concerns? Bugs? Feature requests? Feel free to email me at endothermic.dragon@gmail.com!"
