Expatria provides research tools to help new retirees or digital nomads understand what countries offer retirement visas or real-estate investment opportunities as a pathway to citizenship, among other things. This Chrome Extension was built to help our members aggregate the interesting properties and investment opportunities they find while scouring the web to their profiles so they could leverage Expatria's financial tools, including cost-of-living comparisons and calculators across a thousand major cities frequented by expats and travelers alike.\n\nThe process is simple - once you have an account with Expatria, you can login on the Chrome Extension and start searching. Expatria has a list of 300 different international real-estate platforms we have aggregated, and you can use them as a starting point. Pin the Chrome Extension to your Chrome navbar. Then, on a dedicated listing page, you simply tap the icon to have the extension grab some data from the webpage. If the page isn't in English, make sure to translate the page using your internet browser's built in functionality. From there, we will try to assign some data based on the extracted content, such as the number of bedrooms, price, etc. Given the wide variety of data formats across 300 different platforms, you will likely have some incorrect data. You can click the pencil icon next to each field to edit it, by either typing in a custom value or scrolling through a list of extracted values and clicking on the one you believe to represent the data you want. To save an image from the listing, you will click the 'Pick Image' to select one image from the page to save to the listing, so as to have a visual queue when reviewing it on Expatria.\n\nThe name Riverlake is inspired by the Chinese concept of jiang hu, literally translated as 'rivers and lakes'. In Chinese history and literature, it refers to a world outside of mainstream society, particularly the realm of martial artists, wanderers, outlaws and artists who live by their own code, rather than official laws. But it's more than just a physical space, a group of people or a tradition - it's a vibe. To live within our modern, hyper-organized society is to be stifled by rules and social pressures outside of our control; we hope instead to help people live a more peaceful and fulfilling life, among the rivers and the lakes."
