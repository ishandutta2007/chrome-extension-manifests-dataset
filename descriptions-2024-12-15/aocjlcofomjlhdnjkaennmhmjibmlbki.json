It has also been updated to better suit mtgo-stats.\n\nVersion 2.6 adds a checkbox to the options page. If it is checked, cards you own from the set 'DPA' will not be included in cost calculations. That's because you probably can't use them to build decks anyway!\n\nVersions 2.0 - 2.5:\n\nMade this extension actually work again, and improved the UI a tiny bit. Now displays the total cost to finish the deck, and improved messages when selecting your collection CSV!\n\nRecently, I learned about http://mtgo-stats.com, a neat web site that aggregates recent winners of Magic: the Gathering Online daily tournaments and compiles statistics on their decks.\n\nOne feature on that site is to list the purchase price of each of the winning decks according to MTGO-Traders, a large retailer of digital cards.\n\nThis extension makes that feature much more useful -\n\nFirst, you need to export a .csv of your current collection of digital magic cards by opening the Magic Online client, viewing your collection as a list, right-click select all, then right click export as CSV.\n\nNext, install my little extension, and open it's options pane. Click \"Choose File\" and select the CSV file you just saved.\n\nNow, you're ready to browse some decks! Just browse mtgo-stats.com as normal, but try clicking the little red square (hopefully someday I'll get a better icon).\n\nThis will put a strike through any card that you already own enough of to build this deck, and modify the quantity and price columns to show you exactly what cards you are missing and about how much it would cost to get them!\n\nIf you find this extension useful, feel free to toss me a few bucks via the donation button also on the options page :)\n\nNote: This extension is open sourced under the GPL v3 License.
