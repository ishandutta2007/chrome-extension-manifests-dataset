Go to any one of the sites listed below and it will convert the recipe automatically.\n\nfoodnetwork.com\nfoodnetwork.ca\nallrecipes.com\nepicurious.com\ntasty.co\ndelish.com\n\nThe measurements I use to covert are listed below to give you some background under the hood information, all listed as grams per cup:\n\nAll Purpose Flour: 120\nBaking Powder: 192\nBaking Soda: 144\nBrown Sugar: 180\nButter: 226\nCocoa Powder: 113.4\nCornmeal: 170\nCornstarch: 127.6\nGranular Sugar: 200\nPowdered Sugar: 200\nSelf-rising Flour: 113\nSifted Flour: 110\n\nFuture versions will include the ability to attempt conversions on non-listed websites as well as the ability to edit the grams/cup. This is the initial version and may be a little buggy. Would love to hear your feedback. Please email me at foodscaleextension@gmail.com with thoughts and suggestions.\n\nCook smart!"
