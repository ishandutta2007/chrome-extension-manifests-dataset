BasePass will use a hash, to encrypt the combination of the password together with the account's name. The result will be a strong password for this app/ site.\n\nWhy is it the safest way?\nYour passwords are not stored anywhere!\n\nBasePass will generate them dynamically when you need them.\nYou don't have to trust a third party to store/retrieve/encrypt them for you!\nIt's all in your hands."
