It will not block old messages that are in the chat before loading. You cannot block the people who sent the messages before your youtube loaded. Feel free to assist in the programming but looking at the github link at the bottom of this.\n\nThis is a feature for YouTube streaming videos chat. When there are a bunch of spammers and reporting them for spam doesn't seem to be doing anything. All you have to do is install this refresh the streaming page and then \"Report message\" them once and they will no longer show up in your chat.\n\nI added the persistence that I originally wanted. To block someone permanently just block them once. To remove them from the blocked list now you need to click options in extensions and remove them from the list by clicking the X next to their name.\n\nI need to add some features still but you can see my progress or assist here https://github.com/darbicus/youBlock . You can also submit reports of issues there or request features."
