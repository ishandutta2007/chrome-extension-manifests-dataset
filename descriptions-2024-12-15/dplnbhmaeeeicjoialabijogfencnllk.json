Also this extension provides a configurable count down timer to help you out in solving question within limited time frame and rings the bell as soon as the count down finishes.\n\nHow many times have you choked or given up on a Leet-code problem early only because it was tagged as \"Hard\"? This extension allows you to hide the difficulty level of problems so you can solve a problem like a Champ."
