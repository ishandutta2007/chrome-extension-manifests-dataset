You use Trilogy URL Copier by going to the website you want to get the url from. Then you open up the extension by clicking the icon and clicking one of the 5 applications that are available to send the URL through. The URL will be automatically saved to the clipboard and you will be transported to a new tab with the website you chose. Trilogy URL Copier also has a copy button so you can paste to any application you choose.\n\nVersion 1.0.1 - Added Dark Mode option and added 5 more apps to send URLs through\n\nVersion 1.0.2 - Redesign of the application, giving it more user friendly."
