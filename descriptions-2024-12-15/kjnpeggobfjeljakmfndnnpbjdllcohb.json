Page no longer needs to reload ever when adding or removing user to the filter.\n- you can temporarily view the original contents of a fartized post without removing user from the fartlist.\n- visual style of the extension now fits in seamlessly into coh2.org user interface.\n\nCOMPANY OF FARTS extension\n\nIf you are frequenting coh2.org balance forums, you will quickly find yourself overwhelmed by certain posters' caustic texts and epic flame wars.\n\nNo more! If a certain poster's posts look like so much wind being passed, you can now, at the click of a button, drop the pretense and include a user in the Company of Farts!\n\nIn the future, all the posts of users whom you flagged to belong to the Company of Farts will be filtered for your enjoyment.\n\n- ONLY WORKS IN THE coh2.org BALANCE FORUMS!\n- inserts farts in quotes too!\n- you can easily filter and unfilter users"
