Have you ever imagined a simple click on a button that takes you to the top for every page? Here comes the easy-to-use Chrome extension that just does this fantastically. One press and it takes you to the top.\n\nIt automatically finds out whether the current page can be scrolled up by the extension. If it is grey, it means either the page is already near its top or the page does not allow extension scrolling. If it is green, one click, it does all the magic for you. Simple and easy! \n\nYou can also use Command+Shift+Z on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+Z on others as shortcuts."
