It will Auto Detect projects while browsing Marketplaces, Twitter, Discord, or Etherscan, and display the respective project’s (You’re browsing explicitly) Information, stats, real time activity, and latest tweets to correctly measure sentiment along traction. \n\nThe Extension will also allow people interested in the project being browsed to communicate with one another about said project in a  chat room designed to be for every project on it’s own, again to be able to measure interest, and gauge community interaction using text or stickers. \n\nThe user of the Eye will be able to create watchlists, and start chats for new projects. The higher the usage the more likely it is for the user to be able to earn $EYE Tokens that can be used in the Eyeverse Ecosystem to acquire perks and drops."
