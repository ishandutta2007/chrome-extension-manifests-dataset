Stream Raiders will let you place an army unit once every five minutes per battle. This extension will check the status of each battle you are following and, after five minutes of you placing your last army piece, will create a notification showing the icon and name of the Battle Captain (the Twitch streamer), allowing for easy recognition of your favourite streamers. Clicking on the notification will also trigger Chrome to focus on the specific tab that has Stream Raiders open.\n\nThis extension is designed for Raiders / Viewers, not Captains / Streamers as they have their own app.\n\nChange Log:\n0.0.6 - 0.0.7:\nAutomatically extract api version number to ensure extension continues to operate as expected without having to keep updating extension.\n\n0.0.3 - 0.0.6:\nIncreased api version number to ensure extension continues to operate as expected.\n\n0.0.2 - 0.0.3:\nBug fix: Battles that have expired still prompt for new units (no new desktop notifications for battles more than 30 minutes old).\n\n0.0.1 - 0.0.2:\nRemoved jQuery.\nBug fixes and improvements.\nChange desktop notification icon from extension icon to streamer icon."
