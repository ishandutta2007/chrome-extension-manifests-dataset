Maybe a channel started posting a video series you aren't interested in, but you want to remain subscribed for future content. This extension let's you toggle a channel's videos from appearing in your subscription feed without unsubscribing from the channel.\n\nFeatures:\n-\"Hide\" button next to the channel name on each video\n-Popup menu that allows you to enter channels to hide manually, toggle whether a hidden channel is enabled, remove channels that have been hidden, and toggle the extension altogether.\n-Saves channel data to your browser for persistence between sessions\n-Continues hiding specified channels as you scroll through your subscription feed\n\nSource code: https://github.com/bggrund/YouTubeSubHider"
