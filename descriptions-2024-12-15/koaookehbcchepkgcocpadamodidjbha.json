Usually one must click through all dates and hours ranges to see possible options. And this takes time. This is where this extension comes in.\n\nHow it works:\n- enter specific business page on booksy.com,\n- right sidebar should load already some default data,\n- change date start/end if needed,\n- pick service variant using drop down and search feature,\n- all available time slots (for selected time range) per staff are reloaded in the sidebar.\n\nCreated it for myself and decided to share the solution.\n\nEasy Booksy is in no way affiliated with Booksy.com.",
