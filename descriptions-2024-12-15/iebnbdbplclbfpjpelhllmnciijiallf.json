Open the options menu.\n2. Select a site or open the custom URL input from the selector drop-down menu and add a URL of your choice.\n3. Focus Address Bar: Focus on the browser's address bar or not.\n4. Save\n\nNew Tab Loader\nWhen you add a site URL to the new tab that may load slowly.  I've added a loader icon, loading title and useless quotes about why pages don't load in a goofy way just to give you something to look at while waiting.\n\nWhen you dont add a custom URL press save.\nI've added a blank page with a collection of empty quotes. This page serves as a placeholder for situations where no custom URL has been specified and a way back to the options page. The empty quotes are just something to laugh at if you ever find the page.\n\nDynamic Theme Support\nThis extension follows native system theme options. So there's a light and dark mode.\n\nAddress Bar \"Focus\" Settings\nThe \"Focus\" setting determines whether the focus (cursor) is automatically placed in the browser's address bar when the new tab is opened.  If this setting is enabled, users can start typing their desired URL or search query immediately after opening a new tab without having to click on the address bar first. When disabled, the (cursor) will use the available input on the page of the site loaded.\n\nPrivacy\n- This extension does not gather any personal information or browsing history from users.  0 Tracking, 0 data collection.\n- Users can rest assured that their browsing activities remain private and are not monitored or shared with any third parties.\n- The extension does not require any libraries linked outside of the extension aka \"remote code\".  Just requires the browser's local storage to save your settings.\n\nUltimately the DB Custom New Tab URL Browser Extension is pretty simple. I created this so I can use it on my own website as the default tab.  If you run into issues or have ideas in the future let me know.\n\nChanglog/Bug Fixes:\nhttps://destructiveburn.com/forum/public/d/20-db-custom-new-tab-url-changelog-news\n\nMore About the Extension here:\nhttps://destructiveburn.com/forum/public/d/19-db-custom-new-tab-url-browser-extension"
