This extension takes a slightly alternative approach and measures it based on when a page reaches a frame rate of 60fps. This time normally aligns with when a page has finished doing all it's loading, parsing and running of HTML, CSS and Javascript.\n\nJust load any page with the extension active and when the page reaches a constant 50-60fps over a full second it will then display the time it took to reach this constant frame rate in seconds. Only 5 digits can be displayed so accuracy may be lost for really slow pages.\n\nClicking the icon will refresh the page.\n\nSome pages (such as chrome://extensions ) can not be scripted so the timing will never show up."
