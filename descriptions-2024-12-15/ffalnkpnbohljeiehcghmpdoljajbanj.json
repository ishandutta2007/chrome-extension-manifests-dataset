The extension blocks paths to videos that are not relevant to you, ensuring that you don't waste time on useless content. When you access Youtube, CleanTube redirects you to the subscriptions page, so that you will only watch videos from channels you're subscribed to.\n\nThe extension also removes menus that could distract you, so you can focus on the videos you're watching. Additionally, when you're watching a video, CleanTube removes recommended videos from the right side, so you don't get sidetracked. If you're watching Shorts from a subscribed channel, CleanTube removes other Shorts, allowing you to enjoy your preferred content without any distractions.\n\nIn summary, CleanTube is the perfect tool for anyone who wants to optimize their Youtube experience.
