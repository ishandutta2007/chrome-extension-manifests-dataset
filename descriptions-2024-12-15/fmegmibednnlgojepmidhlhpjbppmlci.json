Let's build awareness of how we qualify our message and diminish our voice. Inspired by the writings of Tara Mohr and others, this Chrome Extension for Gmail and Outlook for web helps you send more confident emails by warning you when you use words which undermine your message. Commonly used qualifying words and phrases are underlined for you to choose how you want to address them. Hover over the underline to see additional information about how using the phrase is perceived.  (Don't worry, the underline won't get sent as part of your email if you decide to ignore it.)  Created by Tami Reiss, Steve Brudz, Manish Kakwani, and Eric Tillberg of Def Method (www.defmethod.com)."
