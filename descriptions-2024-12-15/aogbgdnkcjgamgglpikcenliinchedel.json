Disabling autoplay for playlists is also supported.\n\nThe continued development of Autoplay Settings for YouTube™ is made possible thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please check out https://armin.dev/go/patreon\n\nAutoplay is turned off by default when the extension is installed, and it can be turned on again from YouTube™, or from the extension's options. Reload already opened videos for changes to take effect.\n\nThe developer does not collect any personal data from this extension. Visit the extension's privacy policy for more information.\n\nThe extension is also available for Edge and Firefox: https://github.com/dessant/youtube-autoplay#readme\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/youtube-autoplay\n\nYouTube is a trademark of Google Inc.
