But to see a larger preview image, you need to either click on the thumbnail or view it in the Photos folder -- which doesn't allow you to manage the files.\n\nThat's where Image Previewer for Dropbox comes in.  This extension shows you a larger (256x256) preview of the tiny thumbnails.  The preview image is displayed when you hover over the thumbnail, so you can be sure you're moving or deleting the right file.\n\nThis extension runs automatically when you are on Dropbox, so you don't need to click anything... just hover over the image you want to preview in your Files folder.\n\nIf you discover any bugs or problems with this extension, please post them -- with details -- on the Support tab so they can be addressed and fixed.\n\nImage Previewer for Dropbox is not affiliated with or otherwise sponsored by Dropbox, Inc."
