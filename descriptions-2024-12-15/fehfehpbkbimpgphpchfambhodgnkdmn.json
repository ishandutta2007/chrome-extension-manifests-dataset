It can just be too time consuming to go back and figure out what happened to some intriguing story that you read about a few hours ago. Reddit Follow-Ups uses the power of the hivemind to allow users to collaboratively decide what is the appropriate follow up to any of these kinds of posts. You can mark a post as something you want to follow and then check in your follow-ups dashboard for any possible follow-ups. Try it for yourself!\n\nPlease also understand that this is still sort of in production -- there probably are some bugs. This is sort of a crude first release, but I just wanted to see what people thought of the idea. I am more than happy to hear your suggestions and will probably implement any changes users think may be beneficial provided I have the time.\n\nThanks!"
