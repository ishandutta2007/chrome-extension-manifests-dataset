FFmpeg is an engine containing a suite of libraries for handling video, audio, and other media files and streams. In order to get more info about FFmpeg, please read this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg) Wikipedia page. To download and install FFmpeg on your machine, please visit this (https://www.ffmpeg.org/) page.\n\nThis add-on uses nativeMessaging (https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging) technology to communicate with FFmpeg software on your machine. Before using this add-on, you need to install FFmpeg on your machine. You also need the native client patch in order to build the communication between FFmpeg and your browser.\n\nPlease visit this (https://github.com/alexmarcoo-nt/open-in-native-client/releases) GitHub repo and download the related patch for your machine. Follow the instruction in the above GitHub page in order to install the patch in your system. After installing, the \"Media Tools\" add-on in your browser can communicate with FFmpeg client on your machine (Window, Linux, or Mac).\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form in the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/media-tools.html)."
