It is open source so any contributions, comments, cheers, coffee cups if you see me on the campus :) are more than welcomed.\n\n\nFeatures :\n\nA compact view of all your grades\n\nAutomatic lookup of new grade updates\n\nSecure access to the UPMC database (using the same security protocol as the original DBUFR interface)\n\nDesktop and badge notifications when new grades are published\n\nA cool logo created by me, that has nothing to do with the extension and that uses the first 3 buttons i discovered in Inkscape."
