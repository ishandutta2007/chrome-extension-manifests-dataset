The time you have to wait between split and merge is calculated as 30 seconds + (7/300) * mass, according to the Agar.io wiki. When you press spacebar, a 30 second timer will start immediately in the top-left corner of the screen. If you then type your mass and press enter, the timer will adjust accordingly. This can be done at any point while the timer is running. The mod currently only supports one timer at a time, so if you split into 4 cells, you'll only be able to see the time for the first split.\n\n-Accidentally entered the wrong mass for the timer? No problem! Just enter the correct mass and it'll adjust again. You can do this as many times as necessary, until the timer hits 0.\n-Press \"r\" (as in \"reset\") while the timer is running to turn it off.\n-No game deserves to be ended prematurely, so pressing \"backspace\" in-game will not cause you to leave the page. \n\n7-W HOTKEY:\nPress \"s\" to shoot out 7 W's for fast and easy virus attacks.\n\nPERSISTENT SETTINGS:\nClick the Doge icon in your toolbar, then click \"Settings\". (Or navigate to chrome://extensions in your address bar, find the entry for Agar.io Mod, and click \"Options\".) A new tab will open in which you can save a nickname and checkbox settings. These options will load automatically every time you play, and you can change them as often as you like. Changing the settings in the game won't change your permanent auto settings.\n\n***\n\nIf you enjoy the app and have a moment, please do rate and review. It means a lot!\n\n***\n\nTECHNICAL NOTES:\nThe merge timer is inherently only an estimate, because the actual formula for merge time is both secret and potentially complicated beyond the means of a simple extension.\n\nI'll try to update this once in a while, but it is a side project for me, and extensions have a tendency to grow new bugs over time as the site they're extending changes... so please bear with me! In the meantime, if you have functionality requests or bugs to report, please don't hesitate to contact me through the Chrome store."
