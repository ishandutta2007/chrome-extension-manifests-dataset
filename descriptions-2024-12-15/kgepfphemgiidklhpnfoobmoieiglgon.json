It's heavy, overloaded with scripts, images, counters, social buttons, web fonts, etc. It's slow. It's clumsy. We think it can be better.\n\nMoy.Design browser plugin changes the appearance of websites. It serves a number of purposes:\n\n* Provide a way to see information from different websites in a unified way, which is customizable by end users.\n* Make web pages lighter, with less scripts, images, styling and other heavy and often unnecessary stuff.\n* Make web pages more readable, human-friendly, eye-friendly.\n* Make web pages mobile-friendly.\n\nThe plugin comes with the default collection of looks (which is constantly growing), but you can make your own ones (need to be familiar with HTML and CSS).\n\nRead more here: https://moy.design"
