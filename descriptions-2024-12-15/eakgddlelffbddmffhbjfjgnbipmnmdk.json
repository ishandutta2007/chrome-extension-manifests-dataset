The way it functions is, there are two modes of recruitboost chrome extension, first one is recruiters can specify message length whether they want to draft a long (500 words) or short (250 words) message and the second functionality is the recruiters can also specify the type of message they want to draft whether it is an introduction message or a follow message. Based on the input provided by the users and job description, RecruitBoost chrome extension will draft an outreach message to the recruiters based on the api and prompts given by us.\n\nOne more thing, RecruitBoost not just takes input from the recruiters and pass it to our API, it customizes the recruiters prompt based on the candidates linkedIn profile, so the recruiters get a personalized message to send to the candidates and it increases the chances of replies from the candidate as well :-).\n\nWe also provide the functionality of storing multiple job descriptions for recruiters. So if there are multiple job openings, recruiters can store the job description and title and use it with drop down functionality."
