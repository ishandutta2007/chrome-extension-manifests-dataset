The extension runs in the background, checking when tabs are opened or links are clicked to see whether the target webpage is already open. If open, the extension switches focus to the existing tab, instead of opening a duplicate.\n\nNEW: Quick Tab Search - search, switch to and close tabs. (Similar to ‘Go to tab’)\n\nNEW: List all duplicate tabs, close them directly from list.\n\nTune the core functionality using options - add websites or domains to allow-list to allow duplicates, or use the block-list to only block duplicates on certain websites.\n\n-------------------\n\n\nOTHER FEATURES:\n\n1. Quick Tab Search (Ctrl/Command + Shift + L)\n    - Search and switch to tabs across Chrome windows\n    - Close, duplicate, allow-list, or move tab to new window\n    - Keyboard shortcuts for all common actions - search, select, switch, close tabs (more coming soon)\n\n2. Direct Switch - ClutterFree highlights links on webpages that are already open in another tab. Clicking a highlighted link switches directly the tab where the link is already open.\n\n3. Open tab count - See number of open tabs on extension button\n\n4. List duplicate tabs (e.g. in switched-off mode, or after installing)\n    - Close all duplicates with a direct click\n    - Selectively close duplicates\n    - Original tabs marked with a special icon\n\n5. Keyboard shortcuts and right-click menu options for quick actions:\n    - Open extension window, \n    - Duplicate current tab, \n    - Move a tab to the end,\n    - Add page to allow-list, and more\n\n6. Detects duplicates suspended by 'The Great Suspender' extension\n\n7. Search tabs from address bar - type `cf` and space to search, and switch to open tabs\n\n8. Detect all pre-existing duplicates, and prompt to close them\n\n9. No analytics or tracking, including Google Analytics\n\n10. Export and import settings to file - to set up different Chrome profiles to same settings\n\n11. Periodic statistics on duplicates prevented, and top domains for duplicates\n\n\n-------------------\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\n>> \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\"\n\nThis phrase above is how Chrome describes when an extension uses the 'tabs' and \"all_sites\" permissions.\n\nThe extension needs these permissions to manage tabs - checking for, preventing, and closing duplicates.\n\nYou may read more about 'tabs' permissions here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs\n\n\n-------------------\n\nUPDATES\n\nUPDATE 11 Aug 2024: \n\n    - Added MV3 support.

This allows Chrome's 'Reopen closed tab' shortcut action to work as usual. Thanks to Joakim Nilsson for the suggestion.\n    \n    In a future update, this will become default behaviour: On clicking a link that is already open, the source tab will close. It will go back to the previous page before closing if the duplicate URL is after automatic redirection. Currently this behaviour is in advanced settings.\n        \n    \nUPDATE 12 Jun 2019: \n    Updates for compatibility with latest version of 'The Great Suspender' extension\n    + some bug fixes\n\n\nUPDATE 10 May 2019: \n    1.

Export/import settings to/from a file to set up a different Chrome profile\n    2. Bug Fix: Added Momentum's new tab page to allow-list\n    3.

Bug Fix: Redirect loops caused when opening same document again from drive.google.com\n    2. Renamed extension on/off state as ‘active’ and ‘passive’ states\n    3. Tab search popup opens in the same size and location where last closed\n    4. Option to open tab search in attached state (some features don't work in attached state)\n\n\nUPDATE 22 Dec 2018: Dark theme\n    1. Dark theme option for tab search and duplicates windows\n    2. Darker direct switch link indicators on light coloured webpages, vice versa\n\n\nUPDATE 15 Dec 2018: Quick tab search (updated!)\n    1. Lighter, faster tab search with direct access to tab actions - switch, close, duplicate, allow-list, or move to a new window. Pinning and suspending (Great Suspender) coming soon.\n    2. Red dot to indicate all duplicates - including those created using the Clutter Free menu or keyboard shortcut (alt + shift + d)\n    3. Updates to notifications, including option to disable the 'Duplicate tabs found' notification\n\n\nUPDATE 10 Dec 2018: Duplicate tabs - indicator & lists\n    1. A red dot on extension button to indicate that duplicate tabs are open\n    2. See list of open duplicate tabs, and close all or selectively\n\n\nUPDATE 5 Dec 2018: Context menu update\n    1.

Remove AutoConvert Select link in extension window if already installed\n\n\nUPDATE 6 Nov 2018:\n    1. BUG FIX: Check for `command` key on Mac for links being opened in a background tab\n    2.
