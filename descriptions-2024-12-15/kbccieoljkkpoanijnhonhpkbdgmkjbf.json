Need a more convenient way to access your assignment's upload section when you're ready to upload them? Want notifications to remind you your assignments are due? Well, if you answered yes to any of these questions, I recommend you download the NDHU Assignment Assistant.\n\nThe NDHU Assignment Assistant is an unofficial(not directly provided by the school, but made by a group of students) Google Chrome extension, which modifies the NDHU elearning platform to allow you to track assignments. \n\nOnce tracked, you'll be able to have all your assignments in one convenient location. These tracked assignments also allow for single click access to the respective assignment's upload page as well as provides  reminders in the form of notifications to the user when these assignments are due. These notifications are currently set to remind students:\n24 hours before due\n12 hours before due\n6 hours before due\n3 hours before due\n1 hour before due\n\nThe assignment also automatically deletes from the extension's GUI once the deadline has passed, so no need for additional management. However, if you would like to manually remove an assignment from the platform, you can simply swipe the assignment to delete it. \n\nCHANGES TO THE ELEARNING WEBSITE\nOnce installed, a new button with the words \"Track this assignment\" will be added to your elearning assignment pages.\n\nHOW TO USE\n- Install the extension\n- Go to the NDHU elearning website and click the \"Track this assignment\" button\n- Click the extension icon to bring up the extension's GUI.\n- If you want to delete a tracked assignment, swipe assignment to the left to remove.\n- Toggle top-right icon to toggle between dark mode and regular mode.\n\nIMPORTANT\nAs of version 1.0 (initial release) the extension only works when the user has the language of the elearning platform set to english. Support for other languages will be added future versions.\nThere is also dark mode for thos who prefer darker interfaces."
