In particular, it currently has the following features:\n\n- One Hand Scrolling: Put a hand over the Leap Motion Controller and extend four or more fingers (five is the most comfortable position). The extension will then use the orientation of your hand to scroll horizontally or vertically.\n- Swipe left to navigate back, and swipe right to navigate forward. One finger works best with this gesture.\n- Circle clockwise to move to next tab, and circle counter clockwise to move to previous tab. Again, one finger works best.\n\n\nMore information:\nThis extension was developed as an experiment, and it would be nice if it could grow into a usable feature-packed application. I don't think I have enough time to do that, so I've made it open source, hoping that this could get a few other fellow developers to help on this.\n\nYou can see the code here:\nhttps://github.com/pablitar/VaultForChrome\n\nFeel free to contribute in any way you like. Feedback is welcome, pull requests would be awesome. If you want, you can also create your own extension based on this one. The license allows that :).\n\nIf you need to contact me for anything, you can find me at Twitter (@pabdeharo), or at G+ (https://plus.google.com/106449708024149866008/)\n\nYou can also use the issue tracker at GitHub: https://github.com/pablitar/VaultForChrome/issues"
