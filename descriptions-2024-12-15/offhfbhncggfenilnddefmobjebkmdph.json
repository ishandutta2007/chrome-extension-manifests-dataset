Maximize your shopping experience with Japan Shopping Assistant or JSA! Designed to seamlessly integrate with Japan's top online marketplaces, this extension empowers you to effortlessly translate, save, manage and purchase your favorite items across Yahoo Auctions™, Mercari ™, Rakuten Rakuma™, Yahoo Shopping™ and Yahoo Flea Market™. Whether you're a casual shopper or a serious collector, Japan Shopping Assistant is your go-to extension for navigating and purchasing from Japan's vast online shopping world. JSA is meant to be used with leading Purchasing and Shipping Proxies, Sendico™ and Buyee™. Instantly opens product pages for Yahoo Auctions™, Mercari™, Rakuten Rakuma™ Yahoo Shopping™ and Yahoo Flee Market™* within Sendico™ and Buyee™ making it easier to purchase items through the Sendico™ and Buyee™ proxy services.\n\n*Yahoo Flea Market™ will only instantly open within Buyee. You can still order items from Yahoo Flea Market™ with Sendico, but you will need to use an order form.\n\nYou can now use the actual Marketplace Websites like \"https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/\" or \"https://jp.mercari.com/\" to search for the items instead of finding them through the search engines built into the proxy services. This gives you the same search results that people shopping in Japan see giving you the most accurate search! Once you find the item you are interested in, with just the click of an a button, it will open that item within Sendico™ or Buyee™ where you can bid on or purchase it easier then ever!\n\nI love using Sendico™ and Buyee™ to purchase items from Japan, and after buying thousands of items, I wanted to make a tool that others can use to get the best experience possible if they like to buy from Japan and if use Sendico™ or Buyee™ Shopping and Shipping Proxy Services to purchase their items!\n\nWatch the video for a quick overview of the extension and the premium features offered with the paid version! The Free Version will only open up the item within Sendico™ which is great, but just doesn't have any of the extra features built into the extension the Premium Version does, such as the keyboard shortcuts, The Market Place Search Bar (with built-in Search Filter and Translate to Japanese search option) or the Keyword List Bank where you can store your favorite Search Terms (in English and Japanese) and recall them later for future searches.\n\nNeither Sendico™ nor Buyee™ had any part of the creation of this Chrome Extension. I was not paid to create this, just wanted to put this out there for anyone who likes to buy items from Japan and may find this useful! I love using them to buy items from Japan so this was built to help people Search and Purchase items easier! There is a Free Version that is limited but works with Sendico™! If you sign up for the Premium Version, Thank you very much! It helps me make tools like this and future videos!"
