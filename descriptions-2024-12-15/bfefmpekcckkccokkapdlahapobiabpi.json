Just import a template and with no programming or scripting tell SaaSet what and how to ask your user.\n\nWith SaaSet the possibilities are endless. Although we work within a framework, the flexibility lets you create all sorts of SaaS based solutions which you can either sell access to, or use in house.\n\nSaaSet is designed with non-coders in mind.  We wanted to create something that would put development power in the hands of the masses and not just the geeky few who understand code.\n\nLook Like a Highly Trained Developer Without Any of the Technical Ability!\nThe biggest buzz in software and digital products these days is \"SAAS\" (Software as a Service).\n\nThese are software solutions that run online, usually in a web browser. The advantage being that they can be used on any modern web-enabled device including iPads, Android tablets, mobile phones, as well as almost any computer, PC, Mac, Linux, even Chrome books!"
