Acknowledge them to hide them!\nAdd a short comment to show instead of the full text.\nIf the text of the NOTAM changes, it'll be treated as a new NOTAM.\n\nFeature 2: if the NOTAM body contains geographical coordinates, a link to google maps will be added pointing to those coordinates.\n\nPrivacy:\n- No data is collected, the extension works entirely in the browser.\n\nLimitations:\n- The database, although very minimal, does not clean itself up as NOTAMs become old. Maybe if you \"ACK\" a hundred thousand NOTAMs, it'll start taking up considerable disk space. You can reset all the data for the website to clean the DB, until the auto-clean-up is implemented.\n- It only works on the NavCanada's CFPS website. That's it. If you work at NavCanada and want to implement these features directly to the website, I'll gladly send the source code. Get in touch!"
