This way I tend to see and hopefully *do* the things more often.\n\n**Update**, version 4: attempted fix the \"losing url when you open a new tab and paste a new url quickly\"-problem. Let me know if you still run into problems (wish this silly forum sent notifications :/)\n\nVersion 5: Should work with the new app store format now.\n\nVersion 6: Options page with optional suffix on url, and possibly Google Apps for Your Domain. I'm not sure it works as tasks doesn't really seem to support multi-login."
