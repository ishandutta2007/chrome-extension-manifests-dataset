It ensures your pixel is tracking your website's traffic and all the audiences you defined in the AdRoll or RollWorks platforms.  This is key to making sure your campaigns run smoothly.\n\nWhen the PixelPal extension is installed and you navigate to a website where an AdRoll or RollWorks pixel is detected, the extension will display either a green or yellow checkmark.  Clicking it will open a panel displaying additional details about the pixels that were detected and whether any warnings or errors occurred.\n\nFor more information on using PixelPal, visit our help center articles here:\n\nAdRoll:  \nhttps://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040010352-Verify-your-website-connection-to-AdRoll-PixelPal\n\nRollWorks:\nhttps://help.rollworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040218732-Validate-Your-Pixel-with-the-PixelPal-Chrome-Extension"
