This allows students to quickly compare professors and classes and optimize their class schedules.\n\nRateMyBuffs links directly to professor and class cufcq.com pages, providing detailed and accurate data regarding individual professors and classes.\n\nCufcq.com collects its data from the office of planning and budget's publicly available fcq files on http://www.colorado.edu/fcq/. The university collects its data each semester from students who fill out fcq forms in class.\n\nTo use RateMyBuffs, add the extension to your chrome browser, and search for a class! Just one click and forget. The extension will automatically update itself as more features become available.\n\nUpdate 1.0.1 - \"Added the ability to run without a local web host so all users can properly run the extension. It also correctly runs on only the target page.\"\n\nUpdate 1.0.2 - \"Removed unnecessary files. Added working links to cufcq.com directly to the correct instructor or course.\"\n\nUpdate 1.0.3 - \"Bug fix\""
