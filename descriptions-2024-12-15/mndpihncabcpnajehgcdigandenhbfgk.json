An additional storage permission is requested to be able to persist the\nuser settings for the extension (Chrome sync mechanism). This does not interfere\nwith any other Chrome extension or user data as the storage model is isolated to\nthe target extension only.\n\nAs the extension is not collecting any analytics, your feedback is invaluable\nto the authors for guiding the tool towards new features, bug fixes and other\nimprovements.\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis software comes with no warranty whatsoever. Any issue, damage or material\nloss occurred during the use of the software will not be reimbursed, repaired or\notherwise acted upon by the authors. If you're using this software, you're\nwillfully accepting the risk of a failure due to a bug, unexpected change of\nthe Binance™ software or any other factor. Please review the LICENSE file for\nmore details. The license is available at\nhttps://github.com/codesonzh/binance-ninja/blob/master/LICENSE .\n\nThe extension is built for research, exploratory and testing purposes without\ncollecting any data from Binance™, without affecting other users and with a\nvery low impact on the service itself (only GET requests counting well below API\nrate limits), please be mindful when installing extensions and make sure to\nreview the terms and conditions of Binance™ before using this or other similar\nsoftware.\n\nThe extension is only doing what any user with a browser and a developer console\ncan achieve and does not use any exploits to achieve advantage as a trader. The\nonly edge gained is less time doing side calculations using external tools and\na lower probability of making a mistake given all works as intended.\n\nThe software reads available data for which the user gives permission and which\nthe user itself can access and modifies parts of pages which are clearly visible\nas the extension side-effect. The extension will never try to post any data\ninstead of the user nor prevent a user from performing an action. Modifications\non the pages are only readable, non-actionable and done on the DOM level. No\nexisting code of the website is ever getting modified or interfered with as this\nis built as a layer on top of the existing program (only in-memory DOM changes\nare applied). All computation is done in the browser tab and never leaves it's\nexecution context (which is also achievable using the developer console)."
