And (untested) All Saints! And MANY other schools! Feel free to discord / email me your school's URL and I will add it :)\n\nChangelog:\nAdditions in v1.7.10:\n- Added support for yet another school\n- Rebuilt and updated various dependencies, maybe this will be magically better?\n\nFixes in v1.7.9:\n- Added support for yet another school\n- Google changed their Material UI implementation, so the extension looks a bit different now (whiter and with rounded corners)\n\nFixes in v1.7.8:\n- I accidentally typed a URL wrong and it has come back to bite me a year later. Searching for GIFs should work.\n- Also, an edge case where spamming keys in the search bar would result in incorrect/lagged data being shown is fixed.\n\nAdded in v1.7.7:\n- For 'legal' reasons, I have added a kill switch to stop the extension working if I ever need to, or to just disable the ability to set custom images and only colours. I hope it never comes to this.\n\nFixed in v1.7.6:\n- Fixed bug where you couldn't select an online GIF with the newer grid format\n\nNew in v1.7.5:\n- View GIFs larger, in a grid fashion\n- Load up to 50 (from 25) GIFs online by pressing 'load more' (infinite scrolling feature coming soon)\n- Fixed bug where not every custom image could be seen (max pushed from 20 -> 200, which should never be exceeded)\n\nNew in v1.7.4:\n- Support for MANY more schools!\n- Stupid bug is hindering any more major developments, follow here: https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/issues/9817\n\nNew in v1.7.3:\n- Support for Trinity!\n- Added reset button\n   - Added colours to most used buttons\n\nNew in v1.7.2:\n- Can bulk set and reset everything\n- Can change notification icon to anything\n- Added a 'spicy default' to custom image chooser\n\nNew in v1.7:\n- Ability to set anything to a GIF or image\n- Online features, including collated list of images & search GIF feature\n\nFixed in v1.6:\n- Resetting works reliably\n\nNew in v1.4:\n- Can change background colour\n- Can change period headers\n\nNew in v1.3:\n- Can change left bar colour\n- Can change icon url\n\nDisclaimer: This extension is not endorsed by schoolbox, or any any affiliated schools (yet). I am not responsible for anything you do with this extension, including (but not limited to) guessing the password to above locked feature and putting (questionable) images into your schoolbox website"
