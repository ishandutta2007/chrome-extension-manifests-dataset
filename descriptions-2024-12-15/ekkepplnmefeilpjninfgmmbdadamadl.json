A positive number of days is number of days after the deadline. A negative number of days (e.g. \"-7\") indicates number of days before the deadline.\nColors info:\nColors are currently limited to only hex colors, as that's easy to write code for. The \"#\"(hash) character is currently required, so this will allow hex colors of 4 and 7 characters (e.g. #FFF and #FFFFFF)\nIf the is interest in support for RGB and named colors (e.g. light-blue), I'll look into implementing it.\nLanguage info:\nCurrently only \"UK english\" is fully supported (not US english). If there is interest in support for other language send a mail to mgapcdev@gmail.com or submit an issue on the github page.\nYou can find the project on github: https://github.com/MGApcDev/Trello-Enhanced-Date and is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\nHope you'll find this extension useful :)"
