This eliminates that.\n\nTyped something in before? Press up to see it again.\n\nDon't want to look for those stickers or remember their names?  Save your most commonly used inputs or open the filter (Youtube only) and click on a chat someone else typed. \n\nWant to know which Holocure option chat is pushing for? Well, if you are on Youtube, open the filter, detach the popup so that it doesn't close and it'll group up chat messages for you to see.\n\nI've whitelisted Youtube live chat, Twitch chat, and chatGPT. The extension is only applied in those three locations."
