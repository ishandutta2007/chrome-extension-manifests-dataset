But because CS is performance heavy, this will result in low fps for almost every player.\n\nSurprisingly, the game quality still looks exactly the same, even if set to low.\n\nUpdate: Flash quality can now be chosen on your own. It doesn't have to be low. Some other quality settings might work just as well like \"autolow\" or \"autohigh\"."
