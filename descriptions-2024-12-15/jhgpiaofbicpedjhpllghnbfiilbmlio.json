This is a raw Google Chrome Extension which is created to support following functionalities: (Please refresh your salesforce browser screen prior to clicking on the Chrome extension Icon.):\n\n1) Run Force.com SOQL queries runtime from browser by typing in the SOQL query in the query box->submit\n2) View the result in a paginated format\n3) You can also search within your result very quickly from your browser. \n4) You can set the number of records to be viewed on every page.\n5) You can sort a column in the result set\n6) Click on xls, csv,pdf to download the result in the given format, copy to copy the result and print to print the result.\n\nUser needs to login to the Salesforce.com org in the browser or refresh the page if already logged-in before clicking on the Chrome extension. The chrome extension reads the session cookie and runs the query against the respective Salesforce.com org. There is no need to login again in the extension pop-up. Works well when you are working on multiple orgs and running the queries.\n\nThis is something I tried out to learn how to make a Chrome Extension, doesn't take care of errors/exceptions."
