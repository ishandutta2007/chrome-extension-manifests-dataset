It is originated from the website that is maintained by our team for the same reason. Our data update is more timely than most of the current covid-19 stat apps, which aims to provide the most current information about the event. Now, instead of typing the url in browser, we develop an add-on which will be more convenient for users to access to the information from our website.**)\n\nThis add-on will be an extension of Firefox explorer. After installation, a small icon will be added on the browser. The add-on will not open any page in browser. When clicking on the icon, a small window will appear under the icon, showing all the information."
