This tagging system makes connecting to your destination as easy as a click of the mouse.  Compared to other click-to-call products available today, ESI's tagging system outshines the others by identifying more correct phone numbers, while ignoring more incorrect ones.\n\nAs part of ESI Click-to-Call, users receive a screen pop notification that shows on your web browser and/or your main computer desktop.  We've all had those moments where we've forgotten that we turned our ringer volume down, or couldn't hear the phone ringing because we were using headphones, and this visual screen pop feature means that you won't miss that next important call while you're sitting at your computer.\n\nESI Click-to-Call features include:\n\n- Outbound Caller ID quick switch (Premier seat and above only)\n- Adheres to your current answering rules\n- Auto-Answer your click-to-calls\n- Audio notifications via the Chrome browser\n\nNOTE:\n-You must have an active account on the eCloud PBX.\n-Log-in to ESI Click-to-Call using your Cloud Communications Dashboard credentials."
