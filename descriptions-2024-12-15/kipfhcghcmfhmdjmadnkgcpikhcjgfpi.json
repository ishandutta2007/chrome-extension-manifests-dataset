At Airtasker we have found that by adding a test specific selector to intractable elements reduces the overall interactions/flakiness of tests easier as the selectors are only used for automation tests.\n\ninteractable is a lightweight extension that will highlight clickable elements on a website that do not have a specific tag attached. This is designed to make it easier for engineers to identify automation gaps in their website right when they are make changes.\n\nCurrently supported elements:\nInput fields.\nText areas.\nLinks.\nButtons.\n\nPlugin does not currently support any element that has an onClick event.\n\nTo Use:\nRight click the interactable icon and select options.\nEnter the URL you want interactable to check (will all pages on that domain).\nEnter the selector you want to look for.\nClick Save\n\nPlease feel free to contribute to this extension at: https://github.com/airtasker/interactable"
