The same questions, over and over.\n\nEach one deserves a kind and well thought-out reply, but the repetition can drain your enthusiasm. Convo Keeper lets you store your best answers to frequently asked questions so you can quickly and easily re-use them next time. (And the time after that, and ...)\n\n* You won't dread opening your inbox, because the repetitive messages just got super easy. The rest are probably customer appreciation photos!\n\n* You won't forget important details the 11th time you answer a question about international shipping. It's been on auto-pilot since the second time.\n\n* You can still personalize the Convo before you send it. The rote details are taken care of, so you can spend your time making a personal connection with (and awesome products for) your customers."
