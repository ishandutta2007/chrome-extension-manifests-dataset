Simply hover your mouse over any card to get a high definition visual.\n\n=== Updates ===\n[2023-01-30] Version 3.2.4\n- Add banner to popup explaining I'm about to stop maintaining the extension\n[2022-09-01] Version 3.2.3\n- Add sets up to Dominaria United\n- Refactor the offline indexing code, removed dependencies\n- Fix extension button not always working\n[2021-11-02] Version 3.2.2\n- Add Innistrad: Midnight Hunt set\n[2021-07-18] Version 3.2.1\n- Add D&D Adventures in the Forgotten Realms set\n[2021-04-26] Version 3.2\n- Support multiple videos on the same page, such as on SpellTable.com\n- Add Strixhaven set\n[2020-02-09] Version 3.1.3\n- Add Kaldheim set\n[2020-09-05] Version 3.1.2\n- Add Zendikar Rising set\n- starter sets are now included (e.g. Arena Beginner Set)\n[2020-08-09] Version 3.1.1\n- Use simpler Scryfall API to render cards\n- Add Core Set 2021 set\n[2020-05-01] Version 3.1\n- Add the Modern Masters and Modern Horizons sets to the Modern format\n[2020-04-10] Version 3.0\n- Expanded the list of cards to include all cards ever printed!\nYou can now choose formats such as Pioneer, Modern, Vintage or Commander, in addition to the Standard formats. This was made possible by optimizing the detection algorithms and refactoring the extension's internal messaging system. Please keep in mind that a smaller pool of cards gives faster and more accurate results, so pick a smaller pool when possible.\n- Added Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths set\n[2020-01-14] Version 2.0.3\n- Added Theros Beyond Death set\n[2019-11-11] Version 2.0.2\n- Added Eldritch Moon set\n- Fixed memory leak that crashed the extension after a while\n- Fixed fullscreen on Twitch\n[2019-10-13] Version 2.0\n- You can now use MagicCardZoom on any video/stream on the web, including Twitch!\n\n=== How to use ===\n1. Install the extension\n2. Go to a video/stream showing a game of Magic (e.g. https://youtu.be/cKPaR2uSpPk?t=222)\n3. Click on the extension icon in the top right corner of the browser\n4. Select the appropriate pool of cards for the game (best guess will be selected by default), then click on \"Start MagicCardZoom\"\n5. Hover your mouse over any card in the video to get a high definition visual of the card (works best when hovering over the card's art)\n\nTo stop running the extension, click on the extension icon, then click on \"Stop MagicCardZoom\". The extension will also stop when closing the tab or navigating to a new page.\n\n=== Limitations ===\nIdentification of the correct card depends on how recognisable the card's artwork is, therefore strong light reflection or obstructions (e.g. by dice or other cards) will cause some cards to not be identified.\nAlso keep in mind that the number of cards in the pool has a direct impact on the accuracy of the detection, therefore the extension will work better on smaller formats such as Standard or Pioneer as opposed to larger formats such as Modern, Vintage or Commander.\n\n=== Feedback / contribute ===\nPlease submit any feedback, questions or issues you have to magiccardzoom@gmail.com, or use the feedback link in the extension popup.\nAlso, this extension is Open Source and you are welcome to contribute: https://github.com/arnaudh/magic-card-zoom\n\n=== Disclaimer ===\nMagicCardZoom is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
