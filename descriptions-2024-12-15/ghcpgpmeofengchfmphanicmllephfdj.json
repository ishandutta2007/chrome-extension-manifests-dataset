The stop words are completely customizable, but we also supply a set of predefined stop word lists that you can choose from:\n\n- Politics (All)\n- Democratic Politics\n- Republican Politics\n- Supreme Court\n- Abortion\n- Gun Violence\n- Climate Change\n- War\n\nNews Blockade defaults to \"no filtering.\" You can filter by opening the extension, opting to filter that website and choosing your stop words.\n\nNews Blockade will work on any website, including Google News, NY Times, Washington Post, etc. It even works on Facebook. And you can toggle the filtering on-and-off per website.\n\n(It will also work while in Incognito mode, but you need to select that choice in the Extensions - Manage Extension option.)"
