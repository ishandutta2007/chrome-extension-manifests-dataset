It's a sobering thought, but one that can be incredibly motivating. That's where Time To Live comes in. This chrome extension calculates your remaining days based on your date of birth, providing you with a daily reminder of how precious and limited our time on this planet really is.\n\nNow, before you get too worried, it's important to note that the life expectancy estimate used in Time To Live is just that - an estimate. We've used 100 years as a benchmark to simplify things, but we all know that anything could happen. The app doesn't have a crystal ball, and it can't predict the future. But what it can do is inspire you to make the most of every moment, no matter how long or short your time here may be.\n\nWith Time To Live, you'll have a constant reminder to live your life to the fullest. Whether it's trying something new, spending time with loved ones, or simply taking a moment to appreciate the world around you, this app is the ultimate motivator. And best of all, it's incredibly easy to use. Just add the Time To Live extension to your chrome browser, enter your date of birth, and let the countdown begin.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Give Time To Live a try and start making every moment count. Because at the end of the day, it's not about how long we have to live - it's about how we choose to spend the time we've been given."
