You know how it doesn't work if the image is covered by another hidden element? Wouldn't it be nice if you could just tell it to ignore those elements and just open the damn image hidden underneath. Well good news, that's what this extension does!\n\nBonus features!\n* If there are lots of images stacked on top of each other, it will open all of the images.\n* It will even check for images using the CSS background-image property.\n* Not only that but it will work on SVGs too!\n\nNote: It doesn't work on the Chrome Web Store pages because they restrict extensions on here."
