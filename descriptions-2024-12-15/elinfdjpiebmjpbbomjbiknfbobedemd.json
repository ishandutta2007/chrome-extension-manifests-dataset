This free SEO tool will make your broken link building outreach much easier than it has been before.\n\n--------------------\nFeatures\n--------------------\n- Scan and automatically style all external links on a page, based on returned status codes.\n- View all discovered broken links in a one-click report.\n- Copy broken links to your clipboard, pre-formatted as a table (spreadsheet) or a ready-to-paste list for your outreach.\n\n--------------------\nWhy did I create this application?\n--------------------\nLet's face it: few of us can say that we enjoy doing link outreach. Personally, whenever I try to acquire some new backlinks for a site, I almost exclusively do broken link building. It's a nice combination of getting the word out about your site while at the same time helping some webmasters keep their sites clean. It doesn't feel shady and it doesn't feel like begging for a link.\n\nThere are some extensions out there that already help with broken links, but they are often no longer maintained or don't distinguish between internal and external links on a page. Because many sites protect against large amounts of concurrent requests from the same user, extensions like this will often start marking almost all internal links on a page as access-denied errors, making it even more difficult to filter out the external ones.\n\nThe Broken Link Building Assistant is more of a niche product in that sense: it will only target external links.\n\n--------------------\nUpcoming features\n--------------------\nWhat you're getting now is a first iteration of this extension with the core features in place. Here are some features I'm currently considering for upcoming versions:\n\n- Connect to APIs from professional SEO tools (e.g. SEMRush, ahrefs) to pull in useful metrics about the pages and/or links you're checking.\n- Extract contact information from the checked page (if available).\n- Pre-filled email templates with detected broken links to further simplify your outreach.\n\nIn the meantime, I wish you a lot of luck with your broken link building. If you enjoy this, I also encourage you to check out the selection of free SEO tools over on relgrowth.com. \n\nThanks for giving this a try!\n\n- Martin"
