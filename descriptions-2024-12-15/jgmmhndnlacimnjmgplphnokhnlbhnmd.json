Bookmark any page, add keyword to the title and you are ready to jump the the page with just couple of keystrokes\n\nYou can execute keyword commands by putting them on the end of the keyword or on the end of the url, if selected from the suggestions list. Followin commands are currently supported:\n   :t - open in the new tab\n   :p - pin tab\n   :w - open in the new window\n   :i - incognito mode\n\nFor example: Assuming we have bookmark defined as '[fb] Facebook' to open the bookmark in the new window, you would type the following command in the omnibar \"kw{tab}fb:w\"\nThe commands could be combined. For example to open the bookmark in the new incognito window you would type: 'kw{tab}fb:wi'."
