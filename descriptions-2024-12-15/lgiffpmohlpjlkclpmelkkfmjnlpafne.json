This means that whenever you navigate to https://twitter.com/, you will see tweets as well as Mastodon toots.\n\nThe extension can be easily disabled at any time by clicking the Chirper icon in the top bar. This will stop the extension from injecting toots into twitter.com. You will always be able to re-enable the extension by clicking the Chirper icon again.\n\nThis extension supports all Mastodon instances. If you run into any issues, please feel free to get in touch via the \"About\" link in the Chirper popup.\n\nThis project is not affiliated with the Mastodon project, Mastodon gGmbH nor is it affiliated with Twitter."
