Please install the extension from its new store page instead: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/access-token-generator-fo/djpjpanpjaimfjalnpkppkjiedmgpjpe\n\nThere exist several third-party services which interact with Tesla vehicles and energy products, but the only way those services can communicate with your Tesla products is by using access tokens. This extension enables you to get those necessary access tokens.\n\nSource code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/chromium-tesla-token-generator\n\nAll communication is directly to tesla.com. The only origin declared in the extension's manifest is auth.tesla.com, so it is not possible for the extension to send your credentials to another external server.\n\nWhy is the extension requesting access to read my browsing history? Because of the way that Tesla's authentication server works, it's necessary to watch your browsing traffic to detect when the login has completed. This particular login request is the only thing that the extension is watching for. No data is ever sent to any external server except for auth.tesla.com."
