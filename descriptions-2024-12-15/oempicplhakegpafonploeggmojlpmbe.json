They just can't leave things alone. There was a day when Reddit was good.  Then they wrote their own video player and insist on pushing it on us even though its woefully bad compared to the basic, default player.  And then they added an image page that is just broken and worthless.\n\nReddit Sucks! removes all that and replaces it with good old default functionality.\n\nThis extension will continue fixing Reddit blunders especially when the new experience. that no one likes, rolls out to everyone."
