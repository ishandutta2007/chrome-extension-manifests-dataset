Are you addicted to mindless scrolling?\n\nDo you wish that Facebook would show you more content from your friends and less from pages and groups you aren't interested in?\n\nFacebook has a Friends feed that shows you only content from your friends, but it is very well hidden. Friends Feed Redirect replaces the Facebook home page with the Friends feed and blocks the home page so that you won't be tempted to scroll through endless \"suggested\" posts.\n\n**To create a post, and to find other features you typically reach from the home page, click the Menu button on the top right.**"
