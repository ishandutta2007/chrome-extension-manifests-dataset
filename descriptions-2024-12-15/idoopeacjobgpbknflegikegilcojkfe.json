This plugin allows you to specify a folder path and easily generate multiple files with just a few clicks. No more slowly building files, no more copy-pasting, and definitely no more wasted time.\n\nHere's how it works: You simply enter the desired file names in the input field, one per line, and the file extensions (Without the DOT). For example, you can enter scriptjs, stylescss, and indexhtml. Finally, with a single click on the \"Generate Files\" button, the plugin will swiftly generate the files with the specified names and the extensions you choose. As each file name pops up just add the DOT between the file name and the extension or you can change the extension to your desired name."
