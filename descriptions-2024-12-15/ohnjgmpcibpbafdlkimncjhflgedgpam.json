It is still available from https://www.4chan-x.net/ as a userscript.\n\n4chan X is a script that adds various features to anonymous imageboards. It was originally developed for 4chan but has no affiliation with it.\n\nFor other browsers or for the userscript version (works better than the Chrome extension unless you need syncing between devices), see:\n\nhttps://www.4chan-x.net/\n\nPlease note:\n\nUninstalling: 4chan X disables the native extension, so if you uninstall 4chan X, you'll need to re-enable it. To do this, click the [Settings] link in the top right corner, uncheck \"Disable the native extension\" in the panel that appears, and click the \"Save Settings\" button. If you don't see a \"Save Settings\" button, it may be being hidden by your ad blocker.\n\nIncognito mode: By default, 4chan X remembers your last read post in a thread and which posts were made by you, even if you are in incognito mode. If you want to turn this off, uncheck the \"Remember Last Read Post\" and \"Remember Your Posts\" options in the settings panel. You can clear all 4chan browsing history saved by 4chan X by resetting your settings.\n\nUse of the \"Link Title\" feature to fetch titles of Youtube links is subject to Youtube's Terms of Service (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and Privacy Policy (http://www.google.com/policies/privacy). For more details on what information is sent to Youtube and other sites, and how to turn it off if you don't want the feature, see https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/wiki/Privacy."
