Tired of scrolling through pages of wikis and memorizing or writing down 300+ species including obscure sprites. This will let you know, at a glance, the names of the dragons you're missing as well as your progress in your current collection for each species. Currently it's the only tool capable of performing this task.\n\nThis extension will add labels with the names of dragons you own and are currently collecting. These labels have colors that distinguish their current collection status and can also be hovered to give more detailed information on that breed, including their variants, breeding mechanics and existing hybrids.\n\nAlso includes a summary page which lists all breeds and lets you keep everything spoiler free if you so desire until you have collected the breed before.\n\nWe try to update quickly upon new releases.\n\nA Firefox version also exists on the Mozilla Add-ons platform. Changelogs may be found there."
