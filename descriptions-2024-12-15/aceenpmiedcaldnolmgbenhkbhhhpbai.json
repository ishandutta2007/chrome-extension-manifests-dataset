That's where this YouTube Tracker comes in! With this extension, you can effortlessly save notes tied to specific timestamps while watching a video. It’s like bookmarking, but better! Whether you’re in the middle of an intense tutorial or want to revisit that funny meme, saving and jumping back to those moments is as easy as a click.\n\nAnd don’t worry, the extension is smart - it knows when you're on YouTube and when a video is playing, so you can focus on enjoying content, not managing notes. Oh, and clearing your notes is a breeze too. Whether you're a student, a creator, or someone who loves keeping track of your favorite moments, this tool makes your YouTube experience more seamless and organized!\n\n**** Issue Resolving ****\nIn case the extension is unable to detect the currently playing video, please refresh the active tab. If the issue persists, try reloading the extension itself."
