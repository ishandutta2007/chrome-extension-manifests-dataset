The server receives updated data, and it monitors the prices of the cryptocurrency. The extension gets updated statistics from the CoinCap resource. CoinCap is a useful tool for real-time pricing and market activity for over 1,000 cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere is also a scale with the cryptocurrency indicators. Some are displayed there by default. Others can be added to favorites by yourself. There are more than 1000 cryptocurrencies in the tracker.\nThe chart of price changes is cyclic and regular. You can set up price update periods manually.\n\nExtension development was sponsored by a full-stack design studio Halo Lab. https://www.halo-lab.com/"
