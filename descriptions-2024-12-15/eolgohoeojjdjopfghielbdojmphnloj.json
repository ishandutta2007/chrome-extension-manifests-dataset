Or perhaps you miss important calls immersed on 9gag while your phone is on silent?\n\nThen this extension/app combo is for you. It allows you to change your ringer profile based on whether you are active on your computer. Turn your phone to silent or vibrate if you are constantly annoyed by the whatsapp groupchat notification. Or turn up the ringer volume if you, like me, keep the phone on vibrate and forget to check it while on your computer.\n\nThis works with an android app (link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marketlytics.idlenotifier )\n\nThe extension detects whether you are active or idle on your computer and notifies the app to change your phone sound profile based on the settings you specify."
