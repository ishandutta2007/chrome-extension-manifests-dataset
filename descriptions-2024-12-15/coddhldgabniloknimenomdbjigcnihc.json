So we built a chrome extension that lets you have the best parts of Phabricator while still using GitHub.\n\nHere’s what we added👇\n\n💥  Stacked reviews\n\nIf you like chaining your work in multiple branches, we provide a native way to navigate these stacked PRs in GitHub.\n\n✉️  Needs Attention Inbox\n\nIt’s easy to lose track of a review in GitHub. Planar gives you a single inbox that tracks all the PRs that need your attention. It has the sections you’re used to: Needs Attention, Waiting For Author, etc. \n\n🕺  GIFs\n\nCelebrate big wins and keep reviews fun and timeless with a collection of GIFs.\n\n💬  Changes Since Last Review + Better Comments\n\nInside the PR, you can easily see the changes since your most recent review and also comment anywhere in the PR. (even outside the changesets!)\n\n💼  Improved Code Organization\n\nPlanar automatically ranks high priority changes to the top of your PR. It also mimics Phabricator’s PR layout with the conversation section side by side with the code changes. \n\n\n\nDon’t worry about getting your whole team to use Planar - everything is written back to GitHub, ensuring your teammates see your reviews. Planar’s UX lives within GitHub itself — so there’s no need to switch over to a new platform.\n\nSoftware engineers can spend up to a third of their time doing code review. We do it everyday yet no one enjoys it. A workflow this crucial should not have an experience this bad.\n\n—\n\nHave questions or feature requests? Let us know at hello@useplanar.com"
