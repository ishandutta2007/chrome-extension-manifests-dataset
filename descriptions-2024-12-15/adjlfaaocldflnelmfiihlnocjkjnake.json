The plugin updates the source of the images on the left side of the main design page from size \"XS\" to size \"L\", which is the best possible quality of images. \n\nNOTE: The Resizer does not adjust the images themselves in any way. It just updates the address of the image to load the bigger version. If Spoonflower changed the source of their page, this plugin could stop working.\n\nA resize indicator - white letter L on a green background - will be displayed in the bottom left corner of each mockup image. If the indicator does not appear (it can happen if the page takes longer to load), click the plugin's icon.\n\nYou should use the right button of your mouse and open the task menu on the chosen image. The options you see, like \"Save Image As...\" and \"Copy Image\", will automatically execute using the already resized L-size image. Right-click on the image + \"Save Image As...\" + OK = A saver of a few unnecessary clicks and a few seconds of your precious time!\n\nThis plugin is not authorized by, endorsed by, or produced by Spoonflower.
