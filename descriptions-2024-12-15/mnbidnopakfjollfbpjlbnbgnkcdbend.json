Just click on it to launch a separate window with the show you'd like to watch and place it wherever you want, whether you're browsing your FB feed 📱 or preparing a business presentation 💼.\n\nAll you need to do is add the Crunchyroll Picture in Picture extension to your browser and enjoy your favorite series in the background 🍿. It's as simple as that! 🎊\n\n❗Please note: Due to the way Crunchyroll integrates subtitles into its content, displaying them in a separate or smaller window, such as in Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode, is currently not possible. This limitation is tied to how the site handles subtitles and is not a restriction of our extension. We are committed to implementing this feature if technical limitations change in the future.❗\n\n❗**Disclaimer: All product and company names are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders.
