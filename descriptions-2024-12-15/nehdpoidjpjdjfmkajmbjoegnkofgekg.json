Once added, they are added to a priority queue by Google, and within a day or two will be shown in the Search Engine Result Pages. This will allow you to receive organic traffic for those pages.\n\nThe daily quota set by Google is around 6-10 URLs per day, which is around 2200 URLs per year. With Terrapin you can create a list of your most valuable or recently updated URLs once. Then Terrapin will slowly and steadily work through the URL list adding them to Google daily over many months.\n\nTerrapin runs in the background on your Chrome browser and lets you use your Google daily indexing quota without having to add the URLs by hand one by one. It can save you half an hour a day (15 hours per month).\n\nYour site and URLs are not shared with Terrapin and remain private. Only the number of indexed URLs are logged.\n\nYou can export indexed URLs via CSV."
