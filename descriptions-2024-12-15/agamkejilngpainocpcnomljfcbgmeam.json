This extension is completely free to use!\n\nSome of the key features include:\n\nSuiteQL Syntax Highlighting and Formatting: The extension provides syntax highlighting and formatting capabilities for SQL queries, making it easier to write and read complex queries.\n\nAuto-complete for Table and Field Names: The tool offers an auto-complete feature that suggests table and field names as users type, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.\n\nRecords Catalog Browsing: Users can browse the NetSuite Records Catalog directly within the extension, allowing them to explore available records and their associated fields.\n\nBoilerplate Query Generation: Using this extension, you can generate boilerplate queries based on the available fields and records specific to the NetSuite account the user is currently logged into.\n\nQuery Management: The extension eliminates the worry of losing work by providing the ability to save, load, import, and export queries to JSON format. This feature enables users to port their work to different machines and share it with their team members with ease. Also, if you accidentally close the current tab you are working on, you can re-open the extension, it will remember your work.\n\nMultiple Tab Support: If you need to easily test and run a smaller part of your SQL query without erasing or altering the current query you are working on, we got you covered. The extension allows you to quickly switch between tabs to work on a completely new instance of the query editor, without affecting your main tab.\n\nData Security and Performance Optimization: This query editor has been developed with a strong focus on data security and performance optimization. It does not collect any data and has no visibility into the information users query using the application.\n\nWith these powerful features and more to come, this Chrome extension is designed to enhance the productivity and efficiency of NetSuite administrators in writing complex SuiteQL queries."
