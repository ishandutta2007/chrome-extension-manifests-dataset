Everyone looks forward to the next episode but then all of a sudden someone or some site posts spoilers about it and your entire show get's ruined! This extension will help hide any content related to Game of thrones on all types of websites and social media, automatically. \n\nJust install it, activate it from the extension bar and all GoT related stuff will get blurred out. You an always disable it by clicking the icon again in case you want to read the stuff ðŸ™ˆ\n\nAs for social media like Facebook and Twitter, it works well on any content which appears as soon as the site loads (i.e. above the fold content). Enough to prevent those unforeseen one liner status update spoilers. It might not work on content which loads once you start scrolling.  We will try to work a fix for that too. \n\nDisclaimer:  We are not responsible if by any chance you do get to know about a spoiler. :( Also, we don't send any data to any website and all the processing happens on your computer itself.\n\nAny feedback is highly appreciated.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/@sumeetchawla"
