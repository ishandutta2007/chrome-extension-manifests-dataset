That’s right, we’re not just another coupon site - we find deals that can be combined for significantly more savings than just a coupon code or sale alone might give you. We do all the research to find the best combinations of deals so you don’t have to.\n\nWe call these discount combinations ‘Deal Recipes’ and we give you step-by-step instructions on how to use them together so you can save more. We don’t make money referring or otherwise putting these together and have no relationships with any of the discount sites, stores, or other businesses you see listed here. We have been doing this for ourselves for years and figured others might also enjoy an easier way to save more. Thanks for coming by and we hope to save you a ton of time and $$$,\n\n- ShopGizmo -\n\nP.S.\nWhile we do our best to represent the amount of savings with each deal, there are a lot of variables that could cause your results to differ. For example, some discounts don’t apply to certain categories and will require some trial and error for you to test. Even in these cases, however, a lot of the legwork has been done and should point you in the right direction. Also, we can’t guarantee your experiences with the retailers or any of the other sources we use because they aren’t under our control - they aren’t partners of ours either, so be aware and read all the terms and conditions so you don’t have any surprises."
