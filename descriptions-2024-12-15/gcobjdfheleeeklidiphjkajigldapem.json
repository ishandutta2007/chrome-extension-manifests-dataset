Extension was created, because as primarly desktop user, reading webtoon episodes, that were made in landscape mode by author was annoying for one reason:\n\nWhile it's easy to rotate your mobile device, it's not as easy to do with laptops or desktops (if you don't have Pivot monitor), that means if you opened episode that was made in landscape mode by author, text was rotated by 90° on screen, impossible to read it easily. And if you don't want to break neck or rotate whole laptop (which is nonsense), it's better to have feature that allows you to rotate episode viewer, so landscape is readable on desktop.\n\nFor example second half of episode https://www.webtoons.com/en/thriller/soulwinder/ep-39-forebode/viewer?title_no=2880&episode_no=39 has text rotated by 90° on desktop. Extension fix the issue.\n\nThis extension add button to toolbar (that is at top of website in right corner, for now it's only white square as icon is missing), that allows you to switch to \"landscape\" mode (or back to standard mode). \n\nNow we can easily read landscape episodes too. See screenshot of the episode above in landscape mode.\n\nKnown issues:\n- white padding at start of episode"
