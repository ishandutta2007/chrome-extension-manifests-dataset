This Chrome extension automates the process by comparing only the traffic from the time each variant was launched, ensuring a fair comparison.\n\nInstead of manual calculations, the extension instantly pulls and processes stats for up to 10 active variants, showing winners and losers directly on the Unbounce page. If a variant has fewer than 30 visitors, the result will show \"ANALYZING\" to indicate that more data is needed for a reliable comparison. You're able to adjust \"30\" in the Settings.\n\nTo ensure accurate calculations, include Champion Starting Visitors and Conversions in each variant's title, formatted like this:\n\nVariant B - Title: Added large review widget | (1339.csV 52.csC)\n\nVariant C - Title: Added small review widget | (1221.csV 43.csC)\n\nRemove commas from numbers and make sure the Champion Starting Visitors number is followed by a \".csV\" and make sure the Champion Starting Conversions number is followed by a \".csC\" for the calculations to be accurate.\n\nUse the bookmark icon to save specific Unbounce pages for quick access later. Bookmarked pages can be viewed and managed via the list icon."
