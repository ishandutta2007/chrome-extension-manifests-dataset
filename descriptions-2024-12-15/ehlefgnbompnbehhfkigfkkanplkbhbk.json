These quotes are from world-renowned thinkers, authors, books, and historians. \n\nResearch shows that tiny habits can have a meaningful impact on one's life and Omni Guru helps you build a new habit. A habit of thinking before acting, a habit of thinking like the people you admire and look up to. It opens you up to the fundamentals of spiritual texts such as Gita and the sayings of thinkers such as Naval, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and several more.\n\nOmni Guru will nudge you in a positive direction every time you open a new tab. Our community members constantly tell us about the impact it has had on their thinking and how it helps them center themselves throughout the day.\n\nInstalling this extension is a no brainer as you are trading a blank space with knowledge.\n\nAn important thing to note is that we will not collect or use any of the data from you, your browser, or anywhere else. \n\nIf you have questions, feedback, or have ideas on how to make this extension better drop us an email at omniguru2020@gmail.com"
