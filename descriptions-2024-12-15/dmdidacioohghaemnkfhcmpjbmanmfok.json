This extension aims to solve this problem by letting you right-click a video's thumbnail to open the popout window immediately. As an added bonus it lets you set the default width and height of the popout.\n\nNote: It currently only works with some of the video types on Hulu, including Movies, Movie Trailers, TV Episodes, Clips, and possibly more. I've only tested this in the USA.\n\nIf you get the popup but the video doesn't load, please check your flash configuration. One of my testers reported that he had to re-enable Chrome's built-in flash plugin.\n\nThanks to the r/picrequests community and LAMcNamaraXVII (lamcnamaraxvii.deviantart.com) for the icon."
