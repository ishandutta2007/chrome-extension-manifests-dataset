Tabs that are muted by the user are also considered audible (this can be changed at the settings page).\n\nIf there are audible tabs belonging to other windows, these windows will be brought in focus too.\n\nIt is also possible to control the order in which the tabs will be visited: available options are 'left-to-right' and 'right-to-left'."
