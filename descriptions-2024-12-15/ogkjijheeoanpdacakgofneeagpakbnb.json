As you browse through their profiles, they will appear under the \"recently browsed\" section and can be selected for comparison.\n\n⚽️ You can also compare players against themselves by navigating to their scouting reports from prior seasons.\n\n[Select player template]\n\n⚽️ You can select a template best suited to the player by clicking onto a positional pin in the football pitch UI, and the stats will update automatically.\n\nLatest UPDATE:\n\n1.1.11\n- Increase resolution of generated PNG images to ensure high-quality renders\n\n1.1.9\n- Fix minor bug with rating colour\n- Per-90 toggle now available for all users\n\n1.1.8\n- Aesthetic refresh!
