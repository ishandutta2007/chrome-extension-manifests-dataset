These will be shown in a \"Sencha Component Locator\" tab. \n\nThis extension is useful if you're writing end-to-end tests with Sencha Test, as it provides you with a variety of locators for the Component that's associated with a given element, and suggests example usage of the captured locators within the Sencha Test Futures API. \n\nYou may also find it useful if you're just wanting to figure out how to reference a Component when writing an Ext JS Component Query. \n\nThe Component Locator supports Ext JS 4 and above."
