Works by adding a link to the DL/RP/etc section for torrents called SB that triggers a remote procedure call on a Transmission server do get it to download the torrent.\n\nWorks on what.cd, passthepopcorn, and animebyt.es. Could in theory work easily with most other Gazelle trackers with small changes.\n\nOnce installed make sure to set the url for your Transmission server's RPC interface by going to chrome-extension://dkedofkjmbnclcmfebagckhgonoilnjn/options.html and setting it. The url should look something like http://seedbox.example.com/transmission/rpc . If you are using transmission's built in auth you will be prompted for the password through the browser if it has been a while since you entered it. At no point is the password stored by the extension.\n\nInterested developers can find the code at https://github.com/gerow/gazelle-sblink"
