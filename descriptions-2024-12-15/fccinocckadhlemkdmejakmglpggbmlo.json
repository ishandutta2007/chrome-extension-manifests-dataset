This FREE Chrome Extension is the easiest way for you to know when what you're reading is actually an ad. \n\nNativeAdAlert does not block any content. It elegantly notifies you when you land on a page with native advertising. We want newspapers and other publications to make money through innovative business models, but not at the expense of editorial peace of mind. Native advertisements often do the bare minimum to tell you it's an ad. But no longer. This chrome extension lifts the veil - and camouflages native ads. So YOU get to decide whether you want to read the advertisement or not.\n\nThis is just the beginning. After 2 days of work, I built this chrome extension that works on Buzzfeed, New York Times, GAWKER, Vanity Fair and The Atlantic. What other publications have native ads? Let me know, and I will continue to make this more exhaustive.\n\nDesign for the alerts inspired by Introbar.com."
