However, this means Google Maps has begun to charge me for requests from the application. I am working to overcome this obstacle and continue to make this usable and cost free for everyone. In the meantime, there is a quota on how many requests we are sending a day which can lead to some errors when you open a tab. Not very pretty :( Bear with me until I figure out a better system here.\n\nUtilizes Google Maps API"
