This extension remains fully supported, but will remain on MV2 as long as possible to retain support for older Chromebooks and oppose other issues with MV3 highlighted by the EFF – https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation.\n―\n\n**This is a premium add-on for the Voice Actions for Chrome extension – https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hhpjefokaphndbbidpehikcjhldaklje**\n\nActivate Voice Actions for Chrome with your voice.  Just say “OK Chrome”, and Voice Actions is ready to listen!  Voice search, switch tabs, get directions, and more, hands-free.\n\nPrivacy:\n“OK Chrome” for Voice Actions for Chrome runs as a separate extension so you can disable it if you need.  The main Voice Actions for Chrome extension itself will *never* listen in the background.\n\nPermissions:\n• Needs access to your installed extensions to check that the main Voice Actions for Chrome extension is installed\n• Uses ExtensionPay.com for payment processing\n\nFollow for updates:\n• facebook.com/ChromeVoiceActions\n• twitter.com/ChromeVoice\n\nVoice Actions for Chrome was created by Zachary Yaro.\nMore information is available at goo.gl/0YRdir.\nThe source code is available at github.com/ZMYaro/chrome-voice-actions."
