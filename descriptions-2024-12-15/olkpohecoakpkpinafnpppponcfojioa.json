No need for additional proxy services and complicated setups. Install the extension and read response data on any website hosting the API console.\n\nRecent changes:\n- Migrated to Chrome Manifest v3\n- Removed unused \"identity\" permission (added while developing proxy for OAuth 2 but never removed)\n- Removed \"tabs\" permissions as chrome extensions do not need it in the scope required by this extension\n- Added ability to proxy a File and FormData\n\nPermissions\n\nAccess to your data on all websites\nIt is required to make HTTP requests to API endpoints. It means that the extension can make an HTTP request to any endpoint.\n\nPrivacy\nThis extension does not collect any kind of data (not even analytics). The extension reads the data passed to it from the API Console application and proxies them \"as-is\" to the API endpoint. The response is then proxied back to the application.\n\nHow does it work?\nThe extension will inject a tiny portion of JavaScript code into every webpage you visit. The API console fires a specific event before making a request. The JavaScript code will recognize this event and handle the request. It will not affect other web pages you visit."
