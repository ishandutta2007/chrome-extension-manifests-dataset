For example, \"+140\" becomes \"+140 (41.7%)\"\n\nAssuming the odds are \"fair\", the implied probability is the percentage chance that the bet is supposed to win. \n\nBecause sportsbooks charge a fee or \"vig\" for placing bets, this number will appear slightly higher than the actual probability. \n\nThis implied probability is simpler way to look at sports betting: a \"good bet\" is one where you believe the percentage chance is higher than the implied probability.\n\nThis project is open-source and available on Github: https://github.com/danielchines/odds-converter-extension"
