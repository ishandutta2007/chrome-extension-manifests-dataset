Don‚Äôt forget to share this with others who could benefit from it.\n\nWhy We Built This?\n\nAt lifetimo.com, we curate hundreds of lifetime deals every month for SaaS tools, WordPress items, Graphics, and more. However, we often receive queries from users who missed a deal and wonder if there‚Äôs a way to bring it back. Unfortunately, good lifetime deals rarely make a comeback.\n\nTo address this issue, we created a simple and lightweight Chrome extension. It sends push notifications whenever a new solid deal is launched and provides reminders before the deal expires.\n\nBut wait! With dozens of deals launched daily, will we flood you with notifications for each one? Definitely not! We evaluate tools based on thorough market research and only send notifications for stable, premium, and authentic SaaS deals that are truly worth your time. Additionally, you can instantly browse over 100 currently active lifetime deals through our Chrome extension.\n\nAnd yes, please understand that bringing all this functionality to you requires significant manual effort. As a result, we use affiliate links for some of the listed deals. However, this does not impact our reviews, comparisons, notification patterns, or the order in which deals are arranged in the extension‚Äôs pop-up table. We strive to maintain fairness and balance while ensuring the sustainability of this initiative. Thank you."
