This extension reads the news pages you view, so it does require access to the web page (Installing will ask you for this permission)\n\nTrustium blends advanced machine learning models with a human rating system to identify and distinguish sound journalism from opinion, satire and content masquerading as quality news.  \n\nWe know understanding the credibility of news is confusing. Trustium's at-a-glance simple red, orange and green icons directly on the browser extension allow you to immediately understand the type of news you are consuming. \n\nEach news article you read is analyzed by Trustium's algorithms, which compare it to other articles while looking for signs of bias, clickbait and other forms of misinformation. \n\nWe make the algorithms’ work transparent.  If you want to know more about the article's rating or the source of the article, it’s just a click away in our in depth \"Details\" page.\n\nPlus, you can provide feedback on any rating and even offer an alternative rating, which can help improve future ratings."
