There you can select the photo you want to make as your profile photo and then click the 'Upload Photo' button. That's all. \n\n🟩 I just logged in and my Chats or Profile screen is empty\nThis is a known bug we are working on. Simply reload/refresh the popup window and you will be able to see your Profile screen and any Chats screen information.\n\n🟩 What information do you store?\nWe store the URL you are on when you send a message so we can identify other users to connect you with, based on the domain and webpage. We also store your chat history in order to present it to you in a threaded conversation dialogue on the \"Chats\" screen.

Please report bugs to support@sidechat.io and we will get back to you within 24 hours. If you have any feedback, thoughts, suggestions or anything else, please feel free to email me us at support@sidechat.io and we will get back to you within 24 hours.\n\n🟩 Are there any websites where you recommend testing it out?\nYES! www.google.com is our most active site fr obvious reasons. You can also try www.youtube.com and www.amazon.com. \n\n🟩 Does Sidechat work on every website?\nYES! Sidechat works on every website and webpage you can visit from your browser! Sidechat is still new and so you might not find someone on every site, but if you invite your friends, you can both try it out on any site.\n\n🟩 How do you deal with spam?\nThis is a potential issue that we have been thinking about from the start. Fortunately, we do not yet have that problem. However, we intentionally made all chats 1-to-1 in order to reduce the propensity for spamming. In future updates, we will add a Block/Delete button that will allow users to simply temporarily block another user that has messaged them, or delete them permanently from their chats.\n\n🟩 Is there a Firefox version?\nNot yet but we are working on it.\n\nSIDECHAT PRIVACY & SAFETY\nBy installing the Sidechat extension, you agree to our Privacy Policy (https://volty.tv/privacy-policy/index.html). \n\nSidechat processes personal data in accordance with European Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016. Sidechat’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use comply fully with GDPR, which is the toughest privacy and security law in the world.\n\nGot question? Drop us a line at support@sidechat.io!\n\n************************\nUPDATES - 04/05/22\n************************\nThis update requires you re-register your account due to a needed database reconfiguration.  \n\n⭐️ Feature request: Message timestamp should be represented as how long ago it was sent.\n✔️Resolution: Changed message timestamp from machine UTC to \"how long ago it was sent\".\n\n⭐️Feature request: Age and gender should be optional.\n✔️Resolution: Age already had the option to switch between public and private. Changed gender from default public to switchable between public and private. \n\n⭐️Some minor bug fixes.\n\n************************\nUPDATES - 04/13/22\n************************\n\n⭐️Feature request: It's going to get annoying in a hurry the way that the extension pops up to let you know that no one is on the site when you have unread messages. I'd personally make it so it only pops up when users are on the site. \n✔️Resolution: The popup was previously activated if only one of two conditions were met namely:\n1.) If there is another person found browsing the same page as you, \n2.) If you have an unread message in the 'Chats' tab.\nStopped using the popup window as an alert for unread messages and instead added a notification alert badge on the Sidechat icon in the browser header. \n\n⭐️Feature request: It's not very clear how you change the profile photo.\n✔️Resolution: Moved photo upload settings to the top of the Profile page and added a large 'Upload Photo' button.\n\n⭐️Some minor bug fixes.\n\nWe are always working to improve Sidechat and give you a 5 STAR ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ EXPERIENCE!! We would really appreciate a review if you have a minute or two."
