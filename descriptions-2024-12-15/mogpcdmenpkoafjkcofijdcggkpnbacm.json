No more annoying ads that scare you to death with max volume on your headphones!\n\nFunctions:\n- website now scales according to your screen size (before it stopped at 1500px width)\n- website is in blue and shadow'y color\n- removes unimportant buttons from the website (such like \"change Actors name\"), which were very messy\n- increases the size of pictures and loads their better quality counterparts (all from Shinden.pl server)\n- (NEW) now blocks most of the ads that are on the website, while not blocking the videos!"
