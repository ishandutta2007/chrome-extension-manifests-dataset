Though Chrome will alert you that it needs permission to write data as well, this is due to the lack of granularity in Chrome extension permissions (you can't get read permission to a site without also getting write permission).\n\nChrome will also alert you that this extension will request to read your browsing history, despite it not doing that (or actually requesting that permission). I believe this is either a bug in Chrome or that Google has changed the way extension permissions work, but have yet to update their documentation (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permission_warnings).\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable with these permissions, you can manually make the same calculations the extension does by doing the following:\n\n• Navigate to https://secure.ssa.gov/mySSA/start\n• Log In\n• Click \"Earnings Record\"\n\nThere you'll find a table of all your earnings and can calculate your total and lost earnings accordingly.\n\nThanks!"
