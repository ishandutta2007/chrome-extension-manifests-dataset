The information displayed in that section is still incomplete and may contain errors.\n\nV0.4\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe issue with chests has been resolved, and many bugs in the extension were fixed after upgrading to Chapter Two. However, for the continuation of our project, we need your support.\nAdditionally, the item information section is under construction.\n\nV0.3\n----------------------------------------------------\nChests are in beta mode and may encounter bugs with game updates. However, in this version, you'll notice optimization improvements in the Tasks section. I won't spoil it; you'll discover it yourself.\n\nV0.2\n----------------------------------------------------\nYou now have the ability to manage your inventory, opening and closing any chests you encounter on the game map to add them to your inventory list. The prices of items within the inventory are visible, and you can calculate them individually or collectively.\n\nPlease be mindful that for a thorough and organized inventory, consistently use a browser with this extension installed while playing. Otherwise, if you continue your game on a different browser or device and modify your chests, you'll need to edit them again within that browser.\n\nV0.1\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe Pixels Extension is a must-have tool designed specifically for fans of the Pixels game. It serves as a comprehensive database, providing detailed information on every in-game item. Users can easily access crucial details such as item levels, images, names, required quantities, crafting methods, utility, market and store prices, crafting costs, selling profits, crafting times, energy consumption, experience points, and associated industries.\n\nMoreover, the extension offers an improved display of skills, making it easier for users to understand and utilize them effectively.\n\nThe items are intelligently categorized based on different skills, allowing users to sort and filter them according to their preferences. Additionally, users can track their overall progress by viewing their total earned levels.\n\nThe extension comes with multiple menus, each serving a specific purpose. For example, the Tasks menu organizes orders based on price and in-game currency, displaying both the market price of each item and the total market value. The Inventory menu, although still in development, will soon provide users with an overview of their inventory. Lastly, the Events menu offers information on upcoming events and their start times.\n\nWe're constantly working on adding more features in future updates to enhance your gaming experience. We welcome any ideas or suggestions from our users to make the extension even better!"
