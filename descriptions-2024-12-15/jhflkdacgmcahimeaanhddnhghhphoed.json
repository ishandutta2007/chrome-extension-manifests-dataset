We strive to reach a common ground with people of all faiths while reflecting Christ’s commitment to the poor.\n\nThe ministry, a non-profit corporation, was founded by late Father Michael Manning, SVD, in 1978. He was a member of the Society of the Divine Word, an international missionary community with 6,000 members serving in 72 countries. The community is dedicated to preaching Jesus among the poor. Wordnet reflects this vision by regularly telling the story of God working through all people and the struggles of the poor.\n\nWordnet believes that digital evangelization and catechesis are the wave not only of the future but of now!
