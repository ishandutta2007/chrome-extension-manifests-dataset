For example, create a 'Career' box to group all Sparks related to your career goals.\n- Sparks: “nuggets” of knowledge you added from the web, WhatsApp, or your phone. For example, save an interesting article you found online or a helpful tip from a \nconversation to revisit later.\n\n***With the ‘MindLi - Add Spark’ extension you can add Sparks from URL, connect them on the spot to relevant Boxes, or let them wait for you at your Inbox.\n\nUse AI to get key points, estimate truthfulness, discover hidden controversies, and more.\n\nStress less, think deeper – simplify your AI thinking with MindLi."
