It is perfect for when you'd like to send a credit card number, social security number or other personal information.\n\nUsing MSS is simple: when composing an email click the extension, and provide a question your recipient (but not others) will know the answer to.  When your recipient gets the email, they answer the question and view your email; other prying eyes will not be able to read it. (Note that your recipient will need to install MSS to read the email - we are working on more support for other browsers and email readers, but Gmail™/ Chrome™ is required today).\n\nMSS also encrypt emails with simple passwords, so you don't have to insert the question into the email if you've agreed upon a password with the recipient in advance.\n\nLimitations of the current version - we are working on these...\n - MSS does not encrypt attachments or the subject of your email\n - MSS, Chrome™ and Gmail™ must be available by your recipient to read the email\n\nGmail™ and Chrome™ are trademarks of Google Inc.
