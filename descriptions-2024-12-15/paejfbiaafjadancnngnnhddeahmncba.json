If you try to use a password that's known to have been compromised, you'll get an alert.\n\nYou can choose to run it whenever you enter a password on any site, whenever you enter a password on a \"Create Account\" page, or only when you choose to check a password from a context menu. You can also whitelist sites, giving you greater control over what passwords are checked.\n\nThis extension hashes your password and securely checks that hash against a database of hashes known to be breached. If it's been involved in a past breach (of any account across hundreds of sites), it notifies you so you can change your password.\n\nNote that the only data ever transmitted is a password hash. We never send a clear-text password or any identifiable information like a username or a URL.\n\nThis extension uses the Have I Been Pwned service."
