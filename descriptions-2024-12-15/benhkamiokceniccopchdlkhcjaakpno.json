Once it is installed, URLs will remain as you typed them, and will not be replaced by smart links. It will not remove smart links from content authored by other people, only for content authored by you in a browser with this plugin installed.\n\nSmart links replace URLs in written comments with metadata about the linked document, such as the HTML page title. This is a bad feature of Jira. It makes written comments harder to understand, hides important information, and injects chaotic, irrelevant text into the middle of a sentence. This plugin removes the feature."
