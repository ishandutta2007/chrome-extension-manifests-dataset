Tired of looking at images that aren't kittens? Well congratulations buddy, you've come to the right place! This extension will temporarily point all IMG tags in the active tab to kittens!\n\nNeedz Moar Kitten will not replace images shown via the stylesheet background property which begs the question—will this image change or not? Will I hit the API limit? Who knows?! Click and find out!\n\nImages are provided by the cool people at @Flickr.\n\nNOTE: Images are from Flickr that are tagged as 'kitten' or 'cat'. Because of this there is a possibility that images displayed may be not safe for work. Flickr does provide a 'safe search' flag but I've found that does not catch everything—use at your own risk!"
