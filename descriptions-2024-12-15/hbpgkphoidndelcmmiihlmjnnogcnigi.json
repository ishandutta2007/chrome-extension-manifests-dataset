It generates the history revision Visualization in a co-authored document on Google Docs. It color codes who edited what, when and where. Time goes from left to right. The darker color columns represent revision content; and the lighter color columns represent the links between columns. Extending the existing Revision-History feature within Google Docs, DocuViz shows the entire history in a historyflow view rather than the one-revision-at-a-time view. It can reveal the evolution of the document and the collaboration patters of co-authors.\n\nDakuo Wang and Jingwen Zhang developed the first version, and Kenny Pham is the primary developer for this plugin. HistoryFlow visualization is invented by Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg. We also thank James Somers for his advice on getting the accurate data from Google Docs without using the Google API.\n\nYou can contact Dakuo Wang (dakuow1@uci.edu) for further questions."
