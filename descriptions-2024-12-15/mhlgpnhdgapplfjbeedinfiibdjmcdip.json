After the trial you'll be asked to buy a license key.\n\nThis extensions greatly improves how you watch images on 4chan and 4channel. It adds a grid view, image gallery with slideshow mode, and a button to expand all images.\n\nThe image grid view shows all images of a thread in a grid. Grid mode is perfect for scrolling through all images of a thread.\n\nGallery mode shows a single image in full-screen. Gallery mode looks identical to opening the image in a new tab. Keyboard shortcuts can be used to navigate between images.\n\nExpand all images expands all images in the thread, the same way clicking an image normally would do.\n\nSettings are available to customize almost every aspect of this extension."
