GradePaste is an extension that enables pasting columns of grades so you can transfer grades between apps in no time. You can copy a column of numbers from any spreadsheet or compatible app (like positiveSTEM.org!) and paste it into your compatible grade book as long as this browser extension is installed. This saves time and helps you tie all your teaching tools together.\n\nSpecial features include:\n1. You can paste a column of percents and choose for the extension to automatically convert it to points. Pasting is as simple as using Ctrl-V or Command-V or using menus to paste. You'll be prompted with a pop-up and you can continue with pasting by simply hitting enter or clicking the Paste button.\n2. When pasting percents, those can either be numbers between 0 and 100 or they can optionally have a trailing % sign or they can even be decimals between 0.00 and 1.00. The extension will handle these different formats automatically.\n3. Physics and Chemistry teachers should check out the compatibility with positivephysics.org and positivechemistry.org.\n\nHINT: You will need to ensure that the order of students in whatever app or spreadsheet you are copying from is the same as the order of students in the grade book that you are pasting into.\n\nONE COLUMN AT A TIME: Currently this only supports copying and pasting a single column of numbers at a time. If you copy multiple columns at a time it will not currently work. Let us know if transferring / pasting multiple columns would be a significant help to you and we will consider it.\n\nABOUT THE CREATOR OF GradePaste: \npositiveSTEM.org builds engaging tools for teaching math and science. We encourage you to learn more and create interactive, randomizable questions for your students FREE at positiveSTEM.org or try out our award-winning physics and chemistry curriculums. positiveSTEM believes in providing useful free tools to teacher in addition to fantastic curriculum that can change the course of every math or science teacher's life: with positiveSTEM, positivephysics and positivechemistry you can stop grading homework, eliminate cheating, and give students immediate feedback on problems such that they know immediately if they are on the right track.

We would appreciate you rating/reviewing this extension after trying it out if you find it useful—that's the best way to say \"thank you\" for this free service / grade pasting assistant.
