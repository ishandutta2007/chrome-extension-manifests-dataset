With PermaLinkr, that's easier than ever!\n\nMany website authors add \"fragment identifiers\" to sections of their pages. By linking to a such a fragment by adding a \"#\" (hashtag) to the URL, your browser automatically scrolls to that section.\n\nPermaLinkr makes it easy and convenient to create and share such permalinks. It automatically finds fragment identifiers in the headings and sections of webpages, and inserts links to them.\n\nAnd when you right-click on any element on the page and activate PermaLinkr, it automatically scans the area above it, and copies the closest-matching URL to your clipboard for easy sharing!\n\nNote: PermaLinkr is not guaranteed to work the same on all webpages, since it relies on website authors or engines properly tagging their pages.\n\nThe PermaLinkr icon is made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com, and is licensed under \"CC BY 3.0\" (creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)."
