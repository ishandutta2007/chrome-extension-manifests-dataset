Default or Vim keymaps are supported.\n\nUsage: While on a page with a plain textarea, activate the editor with Alt-Shift-H. When finished, hit the button or keyboard shortcut again. If you prefer vim, you can turn it on in Options. While in vim mode, :q or :wq will close the editor. You also always close the editor with the same keyboard shortcut you used to launch it. Hit the other keyboard shortcut (Alt-Shift-L) to toggle instant preview on and off.\n\nSave/restore functionality: If you you vim keybindings, the command sequence :w will save a copy of the current editor buffer, in case you need to restore it. There is a history of saves, accessible via Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2, etc. The most recent save always gets pushed onto the Ctrl-1 buffer, moving the previously stored one to Ctrl-2, and so on. This can be used across Markdown Anywhere sessions, and helps in case the server loses your change due to network outage, etc..\n\nTip: You can change the keyboard shortcuts to whatever you want. See the \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" link at the bottom of your extensions list in Chrome.\n\nNote: This extension is designed to work primarily with *plain* textareas that don't already have rich text editing capabilities. Using it on already-rich textareas, such as those found on Github, is not supported.\n\nAttributions: The author would like to acknowledge the following artists for making their work available for public use:\n* Demo video background music by bensound: http://www.bensound.com/\n* Promo image background (modified), by scienceatlife: https://www.flickr.com/photos/scienceatlife/ licensed under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/"
