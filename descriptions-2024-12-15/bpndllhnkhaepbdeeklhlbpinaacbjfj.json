Temporary bookmarks can help. This extension behaves exactly like Chrome's default bookmark except each bookmark has a lifespan (ranging from 1 to 365 days). After the lifespan has passed, it automatically deletes itself. If you wish to delete bookmarks manually, feel free by clicking on the garbage bin icon. If the page you bookmarked is rather significant, put a notification on it so there would be a reminder when it has less than a day remaining."
