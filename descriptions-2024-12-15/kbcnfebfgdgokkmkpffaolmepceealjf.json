It uses MSN weather API to retrieve the current temperature and conditions. The location uses MSN's location search so its pretty forgiving. I couldn't find the documentation for the API so there might be some conditions that icon doesn't pop up. In which case just email me so I can fix the issue. I also want to find out if the API I am using has a way to check if its night or not.  \n\nUpdates\n1.0.1: fixed a title\n1.0.2: changed to a more mild color for temp and added a popup to see status better when there isn't enough detail in the icon\n1.0.3: added lookup up location name to hover text and the popup\n1.0.4: added radar and permission from weatherchannel\nFor bugs and questions email:\nicecoldsoftware@gmail.com"
