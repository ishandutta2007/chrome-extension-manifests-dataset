Do you have a large number of tasks? \n\nIf so, you might be frustrated by the inability to search or find details for past Google Tasks that you created a long time ago. Perhaps, you can’t remember the Task Title or Task Details and have trouble finding specific information within your Google Tasks - such as notes, dates or even the name of your Google Task.\n\nNow there is a convenient solution:\n\nWith this free desktop app for Google Tasks, you can Search, Manage, and Edit your Google Tasks all at once from one central dashboard.\n\nSearch G. Calendar Tasks (By Natfluence®) is a third-party app which lets you connect to the Google Tasks API, download tasks, search, and edit them - all without creating a separate account.\n\nFEATURES\n\nKey Features for searching and editing Google Tasks include:\n\n➤ Search Google Tasks by KEYWORDS contained in the Task Title and/or in the Task Details\n➤ Search Google Tasks by MULTIPLE keywords and search terms\n➤ Search Google Tasks by TASK STATUS (easily pull up a list of all Complete Tasks or Incomplete Tasks)\n➤ Search Google Tasks by DATE RANGE\n➤ Search past and future Google Tasks\n➤ Search multiple google tasks lists (in addition to the default list) (NEW)\n➤ View, Edit and Manage all Google Tasks in a LIST format (all in one spot)\n➤ Access your Google Tasks directly from ANY PAGE by clicking on the Chrome extension and using the search form in the extension (you don’t have to have Google Calendar or Gmail open)\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n\n➤ Not designed for mobile devices. This is a Chrome extension for desktop Google Chrome Web Browsers.\n\n➤ Does not search Non-Alphanumeric characters / Non-English text (this is on the Dev List for a future release).\n\n➤ Extension is not currently compatible with the Microsoft Edge browser.\n\n➤ Does not search \"repeat\" tasks (e.g., if you select the drop-down option on Google Calendar for a task to repeat on a reoccurring basis). It will find the first occurrence of repeat tasks, but it is not designed to show all occurrences since this could potentially be an infinite number of tasks which would clutter the interface and hinder user experience\n\nPRICING\n\n★ Everything is FREE\n\nACCESS\n\n★ No separate account required. Simply sign-in using the Google account that you want to search.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):\n\nHow do I open the Search Google Tasks Extension?\n\nAfter you install the extension, open the settings menu in your Google Chrome Browser.
