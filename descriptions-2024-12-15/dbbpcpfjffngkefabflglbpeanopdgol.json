This app will help you quickly learn to read English, read Chinese, read Arabic, French, Spanish or any other language.\n\nThis extension creates automatic adaptive translation for news and articles from news resources. (in any language)\nWith adaptive translation you will quickly learn to read and memorize new language constructions for later use in conversation.\n\nDon't judge strictly, this is the first version. I made the extension for myself so I could learn a new language faster. And yes, it works great for me if you read 1-2 news items every day. \n\nNew updates will make improvements to the design and add new features. For now, it may not work correctly on all news sites. This will also be fixed in the next update.\n\nPlease send your suggestions and wishes in the comments. I will try to take into account them all."
