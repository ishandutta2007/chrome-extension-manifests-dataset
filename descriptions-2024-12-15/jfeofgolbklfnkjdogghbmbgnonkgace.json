Even worse, once you go to your scores page it shows them all at once, which is very anticlimactic. Introducing AP® Score Hider. With this extension, all of your exam scores are hidden until you click on box containing the score. If you get a 3, 4, or 5, confetti blasts off. The higher the score, the more confetti.\n\nA highly requested feature was sound effects upon revealing a score, so we have that too. On the options page, which opens upon installation or clicking the icon, you can customize which sound effect plays for each score, 1-5. We've provided some defaults, but you can either disable sound effects or add your own via a URL or a direct file upload (which never gets uploaded to the internet).\n\nThis extension only runs on the webpage for viewing scores, we can't see your password or any other sensitive info, and we don't keep track of your scores. It just hides the scores until they're clicked on, plus the bonus features of confetti and sound effects.\n\nAP® is a trademark registered by the College Board, which is not affiliated with, and does not endorse, this product."
