Folders can be renamed, moved or deleted. The extension checks for updates to the pages such as renaming, creation or deletion, on a regular and customisable basis.\n\nIn an experimental feature, folder structures can also be shared between users who have the extension installed, in which case a designated page will serve as storage for the structure information and with which the users' folder info can be synced.\n\nPlease note: Presently, only Canvas spaces hosted by domains of the type \n*.instructure.com/* \ncan use the extension, with the addition of the following:\ncanvas.gu.se/*\ncanvas.qub.ac.uk/* \ncanvas.wisc.edu/*\ncanvas.wu.ac.at/*\ncanvas.brown.edu/*\n\nIf you wish to have another host URL incorporated in the list of supported hosts, please write a request to oldpikesoftware@gmail.com."
