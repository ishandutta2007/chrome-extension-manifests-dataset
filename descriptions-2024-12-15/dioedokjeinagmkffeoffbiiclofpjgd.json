Also called postfix, RPN calculators take their operators after the operands.\n\nFor example, to get the sum of two and three on a normal calculator, you would hit \"2 + 3 =\". On an RPN calculator, you would hit \"2 Enter 3 +\". In general, RPN calculators require fewer keystrokes over a series of extended operations.\n\nIt may seem strange at first, but once you get used to it, you'll never go back. HP made a series of extremely popular RPN calculators back in the 1970's and 1980's\n\nKnown Issues:\n1) Calculator doesn't automatically get focus when displayed.\n2) Keyboard only. Clicking on keys and commands doesn't work."
