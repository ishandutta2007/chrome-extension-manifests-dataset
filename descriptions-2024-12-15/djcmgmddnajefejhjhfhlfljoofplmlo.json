Free and \"autom√°ticamente\", \nNo actions and clicking required on your part.\nAll you do is reap the benefits those comments have.\nAnd they do have value, (in my opinion and experience) \nI mean, have, if you see them on time.\nAnd that's the main purpose and point of this extension:\nfor you to <bold> see them on time </bold>. \nIdeally, that would be when video starts or when video playback \nreaches the timestamps time.\n.\nAs for privacy concerns, email permission is needed because there is a set of extra functionality\nbeyond above mentioned (it's possible to load all comments), and via your email, \nextension knows that this extra functionality is turned on or is not.\n.\nStory of timestamps, and their value to your user experience \ndefinitely deserves more words and spotlight, \nmaybe as medium.com article?"
