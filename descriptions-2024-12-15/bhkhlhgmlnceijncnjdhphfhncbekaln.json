Simply ask your question and tell your audience to put their response in the native chat.\n\nStreamAlive reads the chat as it happens, updating the poll results and word clouds in real-time. It automatically curates questions into a Q&A bank and links into a link library that can be shared after the session.\n\nThere’s no learning curve or second screen to look at for your audience as they participate in the interactions through the chat. It's easy to track live chat activity, analyze engagement patterns, and plan out your engagement strategy for every event.\n\nPower polls: Ask your audience a question and have them type their answer in the chat. Their response is updated in real-time on the screen. \n\nQ&As powered by AI: Make it easy for your audience to ask questions by simply having them type it in the chat. StreamAlive automatically picks up and curates the question into a Q&A bank, ensuring that you don’t miss anything when the chat is on fire or you’re focused on presenting. \n\nWord clouds, bubbles and tiles: Ask your audience an open-ended question and see their responses transformed into word clouds or even Tetris-inspired wall of tiles! Profanity and spam filters are “on” by default!\n\nSpinner wheels: From choosing a topic to picking which audience member will speak next to selecting a winner, spinner wheels can add some excitement and anticipation to your session.\n\nInteractive maps: When you ask your audience where they are joining from, StreamAlive can plot their locations on a map in real-time helping to give everyone a voice that is heard.\n\nAnalytics: See how your session performed, which interactions were a hit, and share the poll and word cloud results with your audience on social media or in your next newsletter. \n\nUse AI to write your questions: When you’re in a hurry or low on inspiration, our AI integration comes up with relevant polls and questions to ask based on the type of session you’re running and the topic you’re presenting on. \n\nPacked with interactive features that boost audience engagement, we allow you to visualize chat messages from your audience in real-time. Because we read native live chats as they happen, you can tailor discussions based on audience behavior for more meaningful interactions.\n\nThe StreamAlive Chrome Extension works for: \nYouTube Live \nGoogle Meet\nMicrosoft Teams\nCisco Webex\nVimeo\nLinkedIn Live\nRestream\nStreamYard\nAirmeet\nKick\nTwitch\n\nFor other platforms, please access our browser app at app.streamalive.com."
