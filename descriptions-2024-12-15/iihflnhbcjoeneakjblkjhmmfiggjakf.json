Savio centralizes your customers' product feedback to help Product teams prioritize what features to build.  It also pulls in MRR and Plan so you can see that information for every customer who submitted feedback, and you can use it to filter your feature requests \n\nProduct, Support, Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success teams can use the Savio Chrome Extension to put customer feedback directly into Savio without leaving their Support tool, CRM, Live Chat tool, etc.   \n\nProduct teams can then quickly and confidently answer questions about that feedback, like \"what features do my Enterprise customers want\" or \"whatâ€™s the total MRR of customers who want feature A vs. feature B\" or \"what features should we build to win more deals\"."
