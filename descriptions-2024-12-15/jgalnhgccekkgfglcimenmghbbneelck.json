Seamlessly monitoring active browser tabs for audio output, Hymnify relays this information to a central server, empowering users to access and request streamed content through a Chat Bot or other third-party services. In this latest release, Hymnify introduces a whitelist feature, ensuring that only URLs containing specific whitelist text are forwarded for targeted sharing. Additionally, users can now opt to delay URL forwarding, providing greater control over content sharing timing. Under the hood, Hymnify now utilizes postMessage communication which will enabling seamless integration with the Hymnify website for enhanced functionality and identification in the future."
