You should do this manually, and choose the files from the drop-down menus.\n\n**Currently works best with single sample uploads. If you upload a bundle, you'll need to fill in the list by yourself in the description, but you can still use the extension to generate the tags and an awesome description. You can do this by simply choosing one of the files with the \"select file\" button."
