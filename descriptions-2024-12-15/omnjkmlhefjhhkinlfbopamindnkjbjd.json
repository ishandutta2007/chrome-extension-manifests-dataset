Upon hovering on the highlighted word, a pop up will appear with non-alcoholic alternatives that can compliment the cocktail instead of the alcoholic option. \n\nFor example, if the recipe has Gin, the word Gin will be highlighted upon clicking the Mock It extension icon. When the user hovers over the highlighted Gin word, there will be two alternatives in the pop up:\n\n-Juniper-flavored sparkling water\n- Lyre's Dry London Spirit (with a link to go and learn more)\n\nNo data will be collected or stored. This is simply to provide the user with an alternative to a non-alcohol ingredient. The extension will provide options for people trying to lower or fully eliminate their alcohol consumption for health or addiction reasons."
