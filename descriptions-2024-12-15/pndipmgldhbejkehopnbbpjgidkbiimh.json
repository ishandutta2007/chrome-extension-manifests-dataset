It also preserves a record of your bankruptcies, just in case you closed something by accident. And Tab Bankrupter skips pinned tabs, so you can hold onto Gmail, or whatever else you still want open.\n\n**Privacy**\n\n• Tab Bankrupter has access only to the metadata about your tabs — URL and title being the most interesting.\n\n• Tab Bankrupter keeps all your data on your computer. It does not share your data or actions with anybody.\n\n• Tab Bankrupter does not load any \"external\" resources, such as analytics scripts, Facebook widgets, et cetera."
