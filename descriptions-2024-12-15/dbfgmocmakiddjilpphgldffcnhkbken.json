We also have a few improvements for when using Datto RMM with ConnectWise Control (aka Screenconnect.)\n\nThese enhancements will improve your productivity using Datto Autotask and RMM.\n\nNOTICE: Check the Options page to configure your Autotask subdomain/tenant url.  The app will attempt to determine this automatically if left blank.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1) Ticket lookup from the browser address bar.\nClick inside the Browser address bar and type \"at\" then press <tab>. This will prompt for the ticket #.  Type or paste the ticket # and press <enter>.\n\nNOTE: Make sure to disable your pop-up blocker for autotask.net.  This is the most common reason tickets do not open.\n\n2) Copy/Paste Ticket Number & Title along with URL with one click.\nSee image below for the new copy/paste functionality.  This will generate a friendly looking link.\n\nNOTE: We use \"Client\" instead of \"Customer\" in our set up.  Reach out to us if this does not work for you, and provide us how you describe your client/customers.\n\n3) Control and Backstage buttons added to device page in Datto RMM. These will directly open ScreenConnect using either the default logon session (control button) or the backstage login session (backstage button).\n\nNOTE: By default it looks for your ScreenConnect url in the UDF's.  Check the Options page to configure a specific Datto RMM UDF Name.  The buttons will stay disabled if it cannot find them.  IF CW CONTROL IS SELF-HOSTED: You can now configure your self-hosted CW domain in options.\n\nENHANCEMENT: To enable the automatic connect and CW tab close functionality.  Use the JoinWithOptions action in your CW URL.  Without it, you'll get to the endpoint in CW Control, but it will not start the session for you.\n\n4) We have renamed the ScreenConnect.com tab to the selected device--if there is a selected device.\nThis makes it easy to differentiate the multiple ScreenConnect tabs that may be open.\n\nVersion 4.2 update solves the CSS issue with latest Datto RMM release.  Also, we improved the settings screen.\n\nPlease reach out to us with any questions/comments/issues/suggestions.  We are actively working on more improvements to the platform.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This software extension is not affiliated or associated with Datto, Inc. in any way.
