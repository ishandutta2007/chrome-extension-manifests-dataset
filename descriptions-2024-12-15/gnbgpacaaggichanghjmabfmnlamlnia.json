Please send me an email at griffithsorganizationllc2023@gmail.com if you are encountering issues with the manifest v3 version. The Google Chrome manifest v3 rollout is staggered so there may be issues that arise during their rollout across browser versions (I don't expect any but its possible).\n\nAlso, the Firefox and Microsoft Edge versions are now complete and available for download and use with the same account. \n\nFirefox version is here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sort-by-review-count-on-amazon/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search\n\nEdge version is here:https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sort-by-review-count-for-/jehnmefoldmahnigfmldbefdggjbpdia\n\nLastly, the Apple ecosystem is distinct unfortunately, so I haven't been able to rollout a version to the same account yet under their TOS (right now you would have to purchase separately).\n\nThe Apple version (for Mac, iPhone, Safari, etc) is available here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sort-review-count-for-amazon/id6445829513\n\nIf there are any other browsers that you are unable to get the software on, please contact me and I will try my best to implement it there.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSort By Review Count for Amazon allows you to sort product search results by most reviewed.  It works best when you are in specific product department. After submitting a search on Amazon, a blue Sort By Review Count button appears in the right hand corner near the sort by drop down menu. Clicking that when in a product department (the column on the left of the search result images) will sort the results by review count.\n\nDue to our companyâ€™s ongoing costs in development and responding to user requests, our Sort By Review Count app requires a small payment to use upon installation. We prefer doing that rather than collecting and selling your browsing data like other Chrome extensions out there. Payment is provided  through a Stripe payment popup, which is an industry standard payment method since Chrome stopping processing payments for all the browser extensions in 2020. Thank you for supporting developers! For those that have already paid, please use the login here option at the popup to enable the app.\n\nOnce the Sort By Review Count extension is installed, a blue arrow icon will appear in the extensions list. We recommend you pin Sort By Review Count (SBRC) and click it ahead of an Amazon product search, as it is a helpful tool to find trusted and well-reviewed products.\n\nA few quick tips for use: \n\n(1) Click the blue \"Sort By Review Count\" button that appears when you enter your search. We recommend you click the icon each time your search results show up to sort.\n\n(2) We recommend users consider an adblock during web use. It makes all online web searches less clouded by ads and sponsored results.\n\n(3) We recommend clicking a single \"Department\" (found on the left side column when you are on an Amazon search results page) to get a more accurate sort. For example, if you are searching for blenders, make sure you are in the \"Household Blenders\" Department.\n\nThe sort feature adds to the url in your current tab to sort the search results, and Chrome provides a browsing data notice for that (probably because it adds to the url in the current tab you have open) on extension install."
