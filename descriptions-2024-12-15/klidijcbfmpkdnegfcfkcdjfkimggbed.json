Retain the necessary Floodlight pings to avoid confusion\n➤ When checking Floodlight on the network tab, we usually see different ping being triggered with the same action. It causes confusion as we will be confused on which pings we should refer to. With this tool, we only filter out the Floodlight ping that you need to audit on.\n\n2. Breaks down Floodlight URLs\n➤ It deconstructs the Floodlight request URLs to make it easier for you to identify and verify the data, ensuring that everything is set up correctly.\n\n3. Custom Floodlight variable decoding\n➤ This tool decodes the custom Floodlight variables so they’re understandable when your captured language isn't in English.\n\nPlease visit the below page for detailed instruction. \nhttps://github.com/annnnangan/floodlight-inspector-chrome-extension?tab=readme-ov-file#floodlight-inspector-chrome-extension"
