The addon will remain available for download as long as the store allows, and the source on gitlab (https://gitlab.com/Marnes-group/webextensions) will also remain available to fork.\n**I do have a greasyfork account (https://greasyfork.org/en/users/18593-marnes) and may publish works there in the future.** I have mild intentions to reimplement the core functionality of CSL, IBCP, and DID as public userscripts.\n\nAlso available for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/double-click-image-download\n\nDownload images directly via various interactions, including double-click, a hovering button with drag&drop support, and a hotkey. Includes the ability to rename downloaded images with patterns.\n\nNote: does not support resolving thumbnail links to full size images. Alt-click such links to use the browser's own link downloading ability.\n\nPlease check the linked homepage for more complete information. Issues can be filed on the linked support site."
