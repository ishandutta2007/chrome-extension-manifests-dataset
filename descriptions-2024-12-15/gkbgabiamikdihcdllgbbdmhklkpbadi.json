Some of these functions are the same that can be found in word processors like Microsoft Word, and some others can be really useful specially in programming contexts. This extension has been created with the goal of performing these transformations with as few clicks as possible, making this process the quickest it can be.\n\nThe conversion functions can be executed by clicking on the buttons that are located in the extension's popup, which is shown in the provided screenshot. This contains also two textareas: when the conversion functions are executed the text that is taken to be transformed is the one that is contained in the upper textarea in that moment. Its content is overwritten with the result of the transformation and the lower textarea then displays the text as it was before the conversion. This operation can be observed in the linked video (https://youtu.be/39m2CgqbQRg).\n\nCode: https://github.com/jmt-chromeextensions/FastStringConverter"
