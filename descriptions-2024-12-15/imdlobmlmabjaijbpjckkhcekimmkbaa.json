Promote better search habits using a small number of tabs to encourage quality browsing.\n\nMinimal Tabs will support your productivity with a maximum tab limit to manage the number of tabs in your browser. Too often would I have huge number of tabs open in my browsing window. Not only are they difficult to manage, but it became a compulsive habit to open all relevant search results. So I've designed this extension for people with similar experiences looking to maximize their search efficiency.\n\nMinimal Tabs is best suited for people seeking better mental-clarity, increased productivity, and greater efficiency. See for yourself how Minimal Tabs can help you improve."
