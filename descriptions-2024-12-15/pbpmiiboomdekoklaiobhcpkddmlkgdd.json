The links are highlighted in green for Do-Follow and red for No-Follow making the tool intuitive and easy to use, even for beginners.\n\nThis is a powerful free extension that speeds up the searching and vetting process for users who are interested in discovering if hyperlinks are NF or DF and to make sure the page can be crawled. Do-Follow backlinks are typically considered more powerful than No-Follow and so DF links are sought after and more so worth the effort to find and build.\n\nFinding and building backlinks with this method is completely white-hat, includes manual work and does not go against any search engine TOS.\n\nThis is the first of a series of white-hat SEO tools that will be built and released by Backlinkz.io exclusively as Chrome Extensions, stay tuned for more!"
