It can help you:\n﻿\n🔍 Retrieve webpage information, such as title, description, and color scheme;\n\n📂 Scan web resources; if needed, you can download them for learning purposes, but make sure to respect copyright issues;﻿\n\n📐 Access detailed information about elements, including width, height, margin, padding, and border. You’ll also see the element's class list and inline styles. You can select classes or apply custom styles directly, with changes appearing in real time;\n﻿\n📏 Measure distances between elements. To do this, select an element to view its details, switch to \"measure mode\" and move your mouse to see distances between elements.\n\n🌲 The feature automatically detects the DOM structure of the selected element. You can hover to view the node and click to switch, allowing you to more accurately retrieve element information.\n\n🪄 Scan the styles of an element and convert them into Tailwind classes. You can also copy the converted element code.\n﻿\n🎨 You can also customize \"GetEles.\" with a variety of border color options, allowing you to set your favorite color for the extension.\n\n⌨️ We’ve also prepared convenient keyboard shortcuts for users, such as:\n\n[Alt/⌥ Option + Shift + G]: Activate\n[Alt/⌥ Option + Shift + C]: Switch module\n[Alt/⌥ Option + Shift + X]: Pause usage\n[Alt/⌥ Option + Left Click]: Lock measurement\n\nYou can try \"GetEles.\" on the website https://geteles.com. To use \"GetEles.\" on other websites, you need to pay.\n\nIn the future, we plan to add even more fun and useful features. We hope that, with \"GetEles.\" you'll finish your work faster and more efficiently!\n\nFor questions or support, feel free to email at waynefung1992@gmail.com"
