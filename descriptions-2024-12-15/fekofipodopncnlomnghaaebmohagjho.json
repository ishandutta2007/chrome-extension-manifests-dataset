You can drill down into individual sites and see your daily time on each site.\n\n- See time spent by day, week, or set a custom time window for any calendar period\n- Drill down on each site to see time spent each day of time period\n- Exclude any site from being tracked\n\nWe've built Insight to be privacy-conscious. None of your data is sent anywhere (the cloud, our servers, etc.) It remains secure on your own device.\n\nIf you want to become more productive, you have to first understand how you're currently spending your time, and Insight helps you do just that. With this insight, you can be more mindful about how you spend your time. Thank you for giving Insight a try.\n\nInsight is a product of Freedom Labs, where we develop new tools to help you balance your relationship with technology. Like our other extensions, Insight is highly privacy-conscious. Learn more about Freedom here: https://freedom.to\n\nPlease note: Insight 1.0.0 is our initial release with Manifest 3 compatibility.  You may experience slight differences in behavior due to the significant changes required to comply with Manifest V3.  Please send us your feedback at support@freedom.to and we'll continue to improve Insight.  Thank you!"
