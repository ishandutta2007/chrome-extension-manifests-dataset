With this extension, students registered on ucertify.com (or its subdomain) will be able to take remote proctoring tests. By utilising this extension, we ensure that during the test, students can only access the website/URL permitted for the exam and cannot cheat. If a student attempts any suspicious activity, it will be recorded and sent to the instructor for review when checking the proctoring results. This extension can detect the student's face, recognise their name and face on their ID, and also record the user's screen. All analysis is performed by AI, ensuring the fairness and security of the test taken by the student."
