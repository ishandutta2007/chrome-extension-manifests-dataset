We call it Chatnotes. Where creators of original work can share how ChatGPT was used in their process. So people can quickly understand and separate the original thinking from the menial tasks executed by AI. The thoughts and reasoning that can only occur in the human mind are separated from what AI thinks is a simple task as so many people have solved it before, unknowingly training the machines."
