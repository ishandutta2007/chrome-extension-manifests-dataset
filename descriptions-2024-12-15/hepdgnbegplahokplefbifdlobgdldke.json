When an offer is detected an orange notification will appear with instructions on how to grab it.\n\nLet's face it, AliExpress’ coupons and discounts can be a bit confusing and hard to understand, it is for this reason why many people don’t take full advantage of them. However, thanks to this free extension you will be able to save a few dollars on many of your purchases, especially on the products that are in the medium to high price range (there are usually not many discounts or coupons available for extremely cheap products).\n\nExtension options:\n\nThe extension has two modes: the default one is the \"Normal Mode\", which is intended for individual shoppers, people who normally don’t buy in bulk. In \"Normal Mode\", notifications will appear automatically in your product page when coupons are available. If you don't see anything, it simply means that there aren't coupons or discounts for that price.\n\nThe second mode is the \"Dropshipper Mode\", perfect for wholesale importers and dropshippers who normally need more than one unit. You can enable it from the extension menu in Google Chrome (the one with the coupon icon). This mode will always display the info table and based on the compilation of coupons, wholesale discounts and seller promotions will suggest the optimum quantity of units to purchase to get the most for your money. \n\nWhy is this useful? Let's say you are about to purchase 10 phone cases at 1$ each, but the extension warns you that there is a 4$ discount when spending 10$ or more: you can add 2 more cases to the cart and the price for 10 units will reduce to 6$. Without the extension, 8 units at 8$; with it, 10 units at 6$.\nN.B:-By installing this Chrome extension you accept redirecting you to the links of the affiliate program AliExpress. \n\nJust install it and save your money.\n\nEnjoy your shopping :)",
