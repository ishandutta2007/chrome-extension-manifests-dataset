It adds an option on right click to \"Add {word} to 2500words.\" Doing so creates an immediate translation on the page. The word will also be saved for review which can be accessed by clicking on the extension icon.  \n\nThe Word List is a collection of all saved words. Words can be added and deleted manually on the Word List page. \n\nOn the Practice page flashcards are generated in a random order based off of your word list. You can switch between studying definitions or translations.\n\nYou can change the target and source language to translate in the Settings page.\n\nThe translations are made with Google Translate's API and your words are stored locally."
