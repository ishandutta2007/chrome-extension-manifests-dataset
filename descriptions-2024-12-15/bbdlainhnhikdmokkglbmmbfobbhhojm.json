Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+U opens it by default. You can search your tabs, bookmarks, and history, as well as use \"del\" to delete tabs, \"search\" to search the web, \"open\" to open a link, \"calc\" as a calculator (note - at the time of this writing, calc can only compute basic operations on 2 numbers; more may yield inaccurate results), \"clear\" to offer to clear your clipboard, \"gen\" to generate a password, and \"new\" to open a new tab/window/private window. Cybersearch is all you need to supercharge your workflow with an efficient terminal for your browser. Finally, a way to manage your entire browser from your keyboard.\nCreated by Revaant Srivastav"
