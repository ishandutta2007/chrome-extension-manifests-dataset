Initially, it was meant to be a simple tool for sending links to the N8N program, but it eventually gained additional features like profiles, background customization, and a tag booster that allows for quick and easy tag addition. All config can be easy backup, save and edit as it is visible in configuration as JSON dump.\n\nThe extension allows configuration of various profiles, and the ability to define custom URLs and body content makes it versatile for different purposes.\n\nFeel free to share any improvement ideas, errors, or suggestions on GitHub.\n\nA synthetic creation has produced a functioning work. \n\nLicense: MIT - Without ads, data collection, and completely free forever.\n\n\nVersion:\n* 2024-09-19 - initial release"
