However searching manually does not filter any videos.\n### How Do I use it?\n    To add a channel to the filter, navigate to the channel's page and you'll see a gray button that says ***Add Channel***. *(if you do not see this, refresh the page)*\n    To remove a channel you can do two things. Either navigate to the chrome extension at the top right of your browser, click on it, and click on the channel you want to remove. Or you can navigate back to the channel's page and click the gray button that says ***Remove Channel*** *(Again if you do not see this, refresh the page)*"
