This allows you to automatically donate to your favorite charity at no hassle to you!\n\nFIREFOX User -> https://mzl.la/2n8X5aa\n\n***I am Happy to say this extension supports International for UK (amazon.co.uk) and Germany (amazon.de). New countries will be added as smile becomes eligible.*** \n\nNew to Smile?\n\nAfter a one time set-up, every purchase you make through the Amazon Smile program, Amazon will donate 0.5% of the cost of eligible items to the charity you selected! Amazon covers the full cost, all you have to do is add a smile. Amazon Smile has raised almost 90 million dollars for charities but we can make this much greater. There are thousands of charities to choose from. AmazonSmile is owned and operated by Amazon. Click this link to find out more: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/\n\nWhat does this extension do and does it use HTTPS?\n\nYes, it works by simply capturing any Amazon.com URL, adding a Smile, and sending the browser to AmazonSmile (https://smile.amazon.com) instead. HTTPS is used so the connection remains secure. As a matter of fact HTTP only requests are ignored.\n\nDoes it track me?\n\nNo, this extension does not track or capture any data. It simply changes the amazon url to use smile.amazon on eligible products. Check the permissions in the extension to see that only amazon urls are used.\n\nBugs or issues?  \n\nPlease leave a review detailing the issue and I will get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nYou already planned on buying something so why not donate at the same time for FREE. All you have to do is select your charity and you never have to worry about it again!\n\nThe extension was not created or endorsed by Amazon.
