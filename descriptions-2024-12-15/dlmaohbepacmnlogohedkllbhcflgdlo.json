This is my first extension. I hope U find this useful. How it works is that you enter two numbers in the two boxes in the popup. Then press enter to get a random number between those two numbers.\n\nThis can be a useful extension to Install as, for example, u might need a random number to select how many XYZ u need in a game.\n\nAnd why should you use this extension for generating random numbers instead of others. The answer is because it has some extra features which most don't have.\n\nIf you have a complaint, suggestion or have spotted a glitch, then contact via the google form on the support tab.\n\nSecret: Press F2 to cycle between two themes.\n\nWhat's new in the 1.1 update:\n- Added support for decimal numbers. The extension will generate random numbers with the amount of decimal places the same as the first number you entered."
