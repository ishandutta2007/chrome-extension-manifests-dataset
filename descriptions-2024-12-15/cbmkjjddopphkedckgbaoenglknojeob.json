I have decided to\nuse Ctrl + Q, as hijacking the Tab native behavior, would go\nagainst the accessibility principles.\n\nAuto save: Every time you type, the string is saved into the\nlocal storage and it is read from there on every new tab.\nI'm honestly planning to make a different approach as this\nmay be too much stress for the browser just to save a plain\ntext. Stay tuned for the next update.\n\nNew Features: Countdown\n\nClick reset: Click or tap on countdown to reset the\ncountdown timer. It will delete the previously saved date\nfrom the local storage and reload the page. It'll keep the\ntextarea value value though.\n\nIf you want to support me and encourage me to develop more free\nand open source tools, feel free to help me out with my cat's food lol\n\nPayPal Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=V6MG7L7EA4HW8"
