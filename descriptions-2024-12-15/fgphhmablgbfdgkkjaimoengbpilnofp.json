It's particularly useful for capturing long-running conversations that you may want to use as a source of data for other purposes.\n\nUsage\n\n1. Navigate to poe.com and start a conversation with an AI bot.\n2. Once you've completed the conversation you want to save, click the PoeLog extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.\n3. The extension will generate a text file containing the full transcript of your conversation, including both your messages and the bot's responses.\n4. The file will be automatically downloaded to your default downloads location.\n\nNotes\n\n- PoeLog does not send any data to external servers. All processing is done locally within the Chrome browser.\n\nContributing\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to PoeLog or report any issues, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elifiner/poelog).\n\nLicense\n\nPoeLog is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)."
