Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n* Supports Google Apps accounts\n* Works on javascript-inserted links\n* Includes option of working on bcc: fields\n\nIt supports to, cc, subject, and body (and optionally bcc) fields, and is made to be compatible with RFC2368, the mailto: scheme standard.\n\nIt doesn't modify the mailto:address itself, so you can still see the link in the status bar when you hover over it, which allows you to easily read the target at a glance.\n\n\nPlease note, this extension doesn't need or provide any access to your mail account. It just makes links open in a Gmail account that you are already signed into. This extension can't help with mailto links outside of chrome.\n\n\nMore info:\nRFC2368 - The mailto URL scheme: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2368.html\nmailto links test page: http://www.scottseverance.us/mailto.html\n\nRecent changes:\n* No longer need to refresh tabs on install, or after updating settings.\n* Updated code to avoid deprecation warnings, and warnings in console.\n\nPrivacy policy:\nIn short, this extension does not store or transmit any personal information.\nRead the privacy policy here: http://ilikesleeping.co.uk/mailto-privacy-policy/"
