Monitor the latest network stats, keep an eye on Ethereum staking, and even monitor your favourite wallets, with plenty more features coming soon!\n\nThe ethdash Chrome extension is a companion to the ethdash.xyz site created in 2022. We put all of your favourite Ethereum Dashboards in one place, and now we're taking it one step further by having them one-click away as a browser extension. Thanks again to Superphiz for getting the idea started! Check out the site at ethdash.xyz\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the project, please reach out to us below. We're always looking for new ideas and ways to improve the experience.\n\nSite: ethdash.xyz\nTwitter: @mfbevan"
