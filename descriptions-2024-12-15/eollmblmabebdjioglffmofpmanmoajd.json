With fake posts, scammers, and realtors posting houses for sale, there's just as much time spent blocking unwanted results as there is looking for the right place to rent.\n\nCraigslist Search Filter adds an extra layer of filters to the craigslist search results based on the post's images and/or title. Allowing you to hide posts containing the attributes that you don't want to see (aka attributes most commonly found in spam posts in your area). Helping you to find real rentals from real landlords faster.\n\nChange Log:\n--------------\nv1.1.1 Minor styling fixes on the options popup.\n\nv1.1 Added custom text filtering and the option to filter on a minimum image limit."
