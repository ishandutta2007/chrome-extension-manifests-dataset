This can be useful for bots, spammers, self-advertisers, and people posting solutions in the discussion section of a problem.\n\nAfter enabling the extension, \"Block\" buttons will appear on every comment and reply. Clicking it will add that user to the block list and hide all of their posts as long as you keep them blocked.\n\nIf you want to manually block a user by username, click on the extension icon to open the popup, enter the username into the text field, and click the \"Block User\" button.\n\nTo unblock a user, simply open the extension popup, locate the username in the list, and click the \"Unblock\" button next to it.\n\nTo unblock every user, open the extension popup and click the \"Unblock All\" button. After confirming your decision, your block list will be cleared, and all posts will be visible again."
