After studying with GRE Genius, I felt asinine, inept, and inane! Yet somehow I increased my score 10 points - guess I'm a little more sagacious than I thought :)\" - Sarah Z., PhD Candidate - CS @ Harvard University\n\n\"The GRE sucks. As a non-native English speaker, the GRE majorly sucks! But seriously, GRE Genius made studying suck way less, and I improved my verbal reasoning score from 153 to 168!\" - Lorenzo L., Grad Student - AI @ UC Berkeley\n\n\"GRE vocab made easy! As a working mom, it was hard to find time to study for the GRE. Since my daughter didn't make the best study partner (teaching a 5 year old words like aberrant backfired when she started creating new insults for her classmates), I had to find a better study method. Thanks to GRE Genius, I improved 12 points in my verbal reasoning score, and I hardly felt like I was studying.
