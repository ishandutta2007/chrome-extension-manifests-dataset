This widget is based in a thumbnail in the lower left corner of the page and, when clicked, shows a window in which you can leave a review about any page and rate it. Other users of the extension can see each other's reviews and add their own comments to them. If the user is on the yandex search engine page and there are urls in its output that have a comment and rating, then the extension adds a user rating to the link based on the reviews they left."
