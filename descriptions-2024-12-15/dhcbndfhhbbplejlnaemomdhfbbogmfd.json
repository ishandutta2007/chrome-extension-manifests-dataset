If there is a quota assigned, you can provide that value too, along with the rate over the quota amount. The result will be determined based on the quota specified, in this case.\n\nThe \"Advanced\" section of the extension works based on rate lookup or ranges. You can use the rate lookup to specify the ranges and the relevant rate percentage for each range. The extension will pick the right percentage value based on the sales amount provided and calculate the result. If the Calculation Type selected is Tier, the amount will be cumulated (prorated) for each range, as the sales amount passes over each range.\n\nIf the quota is specified, the extension will calculate the attainment percentage based on the sales amount and quota provided. Then these values will be compared with the rate lookup ranges to derive the commission rate for that range. If you don't have an attainment-based Compensation Plan, feel free to skip providing any quota values.\n\nSupported types: \n- Flat rate or percentage based\n- Sliding Scale\n- Sliding Scale with Proration\n- Tiered or Tier-based with prorated ranges\n- Attainment based and Quota based."
