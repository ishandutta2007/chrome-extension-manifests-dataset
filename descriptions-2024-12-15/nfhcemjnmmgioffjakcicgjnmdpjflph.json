This well-structured Todo app keeps us productive and focused on valuable work.\nHowever, there is one point that is not cool. They constantly fuel upgrades through the main UI.\n\nTo keep Asana in love, I created an extension that makes Asana's UI more minimal. This extension has almost turned off the fanfare to upgrades.\n\nJust install it."
