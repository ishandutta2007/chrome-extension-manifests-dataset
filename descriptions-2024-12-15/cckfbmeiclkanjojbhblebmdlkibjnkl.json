This extension eliminates the need for users to manually copy and paste their code from LeetCode to GitHub, saving them time and effort. With this extension, users can easily showcase their coding skills and build their portfolios on GitHub.\n\nSteps to follow\n1. Go to the \"Problem\" tab in Leetcode and select a question from LeetCode.\n2. Wait for the message \"Successfully retrieved the question's details\" to appear.\n3. Choose your preferred programming language and write your code.\n4. Click the \"Submit\" button and wait for the message \"Your code has been successfully uploaded to GitHub\" to appear next to the \"Console\" button.\n\nNOTE:\nTo update your code, simply go to the \"Description\" tab, refresh the page, and follow the same steps as above.\n\n\nPlus, stay tuned â€“ I plan to expand CodeSyncer to other platforms like GFG, CodingNinja, and more! \nBest of all, the code is open-source on GitHub, so if you have any ideas for new features, bug fixes, or other contributions, I'd love to hear from you."
