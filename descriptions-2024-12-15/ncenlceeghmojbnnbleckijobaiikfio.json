With this tool, identifying errors, warnings, info, and debug logs becomes a breeze, significantly reducing the time it takes to pinpoint critical issues.\n\nThis extension seamlessly integrates with CloudWatch's Log Groups and Log Insights sections, enhancing your monitoring workflow. While Log Tails support is currently a work in progress, expect updates soon.\n\nTailor your viewing experience with two distinct modes: Color and Background. In Color mode, keywords like \"error\" or \"warning\" are highlighted with designated colors and accompanying emojis, while Background mode shades entire log rows based on their significance (maintaining the shade opacity for the even rows). Plus, both modes support customizing hues to your preference using the color picker from the extension UI.\n\nExperience seamless log colorization with Auto Mode, offering three convenient settings: Timer, Dom, and the possibly upcoming Net mode. Dom mode stands out as the optimal choice for performance, automatically colorizing logs with each page change, eliminating the need for continuous manual interaction.\n\nEnhance your AWS CloudWatch experience today with AWS CloudWatch Colorizer. Simplify log interpretation, streamline debugging, and boost productivity by effortlessly identifying critical errors."
