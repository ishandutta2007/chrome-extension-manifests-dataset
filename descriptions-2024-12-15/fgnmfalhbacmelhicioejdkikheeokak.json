MintSafe scans the website you're currently on to see if it can detect any abnormal/malicious code practices. It will give you an overview of potential issues and detect mint scam/phishing websites with a great success rate. \n\nMintSafe always provides involved addresses, what flags we raised, and links to Etherscan and Opensea to verify its authenticity. (Always quadruple check contract addresses found by MintSafe with the project's community!)\n\n**MintSafe currently only supports Ethereum\n\nSee screenshots for further information on how to use or continue:\n\nHow to use:\n\n1. Load the mint page of the NFT project you want to mint\n2. Click to open the extension, a scan will start.\n3. Tada! You will see a green screen if no issues have been found. It is still smart to verify the found addresses on the page with the NFT's community.  If your screen turns red, that means we have found issues."
