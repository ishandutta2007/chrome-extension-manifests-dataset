It is the plugin user's responsibility to re-verify every number computed before investing more time in further evaluation of the property.\n\nThe usage of the plugin is solely a pre-screening of comparable houses.  That is it makes sense only when comparing the houses in the same community.\n\nThe only thing the plugin does is : \n- dividing Price by footage for every property and displaying it in blue font.\n- calculates average price per square foot on the very page you look at.\n- changes color to green for prices below 10% average; to red for 15% above average.\n- Monthly payment with zero(0) down, 30 years at 4.63% for every property on the page."
