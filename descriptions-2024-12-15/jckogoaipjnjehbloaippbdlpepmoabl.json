It is a score between 0 and 100 and the closer you get to 100 the better it would be to flip that nft. \n\nYou can also click on the extension to filter and select only the NFTs above a score you choose. You can also quick buy the nft you want in one-click.\n\nRequirements:\n\nCurrently it only works with collections on which the floor price is displayed above. As the rarity is an important part of the score calculation, the rarity is also needed, and for now we only support Moonrank.\n\nTwo examples of NFT flipping strategies with Magic Sniper:\n\n- Sort listings by \"Moonrank: Rare to common\" AND filter results with a maximum price close to the floor price (e.g. if the floor price is 4, display only nfts listed at 7 maximum).\n\n- Sort results by \"Recent listings\". This is an effective strategy especially for fast snipers, just spam the \"search\" button on the extension after inputting above which score you want to filter.\n\nWhat will be added in futures updates?\n\nWe are currently working on a system that refreshes every second without you having to re-filter each time to get the new results."
