You might be living far away from any dive site. You might have just injured yourself. Your job inconvenient working hours prevent you from going into the sea. Or you might have another reason.\n\nThis extension is not going to solve any of these problems (sorry), but it will show you a beautiful underwater photo at every opened tab. Discover colourful corals, fishes & nudibranchs, big whales & sharks, amazing wrecks!\n\nDo you really like a photo? Click on the author's name to find out more about his work!\nDo you want to dive at the same place? Click on the photo location to find out exactly where it is!\n\nLet's dive, one tab at a time!\n\n--\nWe would love to hear your ideas and feedbacks. If you have any suggestions, please leave a review!"
