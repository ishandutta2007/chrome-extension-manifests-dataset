Your geographic location obtained via JavaScript is often highly accurate, which can be a violation of your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows enjoying geolocation applications while protecting your privacy, by reporting a fake location to websites, after adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to the real one. The noise is randomly selected in a way that protects the real location from being accurately inferred. There's also an option to use a fixed location, instead of adding noise to the real one.\n\nIMPORTANT: Location Guard protects against JavaScript-based geolocation (which has very high accuracy), NOT IP-based geolocation (which typically has low accuracy). If a website detects your coarse location from your IP address, then use a VPN, Location Guard is not meant to solve this problem.\n\nTo report an issue with Location Guard please use the following page: https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard/issues"
