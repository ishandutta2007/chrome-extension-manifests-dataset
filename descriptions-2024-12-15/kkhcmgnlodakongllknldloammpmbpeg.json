We want media outlets on both the left and the right to start following basic journalistic norms again.\n\nWe present our scores the same way packaged foods show you their nutrition labels - to help you make an informed decision before you consume it.\n\nTo run a Valurank report, download this extension, navigate to any page, and simply click on the Valurank icon to the right of your browser's address bar.\n\nAlternatively, join us at https://otherweb.com/ where all the junk has been filtered out and all articles have nutrition labels already!"
