You may also right-click on the toolbar button and choose Add to Speed Dial from there. A screenshot of the website will be added to the speed dial page. To access your speed dial, click on the toolbar symbol. Within the UI of speed dial, there is a settings sidebar that allows you to change certain aesthetic preferences. There are several background pictures included (open sidebar for alternate options). Please keep in mind that all preferences are auto-saved in memory.\n\nNote 1: When you first install the plugin, few websites are added to your speed dial automatically from your history (most visited sites). These websites do not have a screenshot.\n\nNote 2: A user might drag and drop any of the speed dial UI's cells to a new position. Simply drag and drop the cell to your preferred location; all cells will be reordered automatically, and you'll be able to store them to memory.\n\nNote 3: The \"Speed Dial World\" add-on does not alter the appearance of the new tab in your browser. It just creates a stand-alone page using Speed Dial UI.\n\nNote 4: To add desired pages to the speed dial, use the keyboard command (Alt + Shift + A).\n\nNote 5: To add the current tab or, if you want, all tabs to your speed dial, go to the extension's context menu and select \"Add this tab or all tabs to my speed dial.\" If you choose all tabs, the extension will require broad host access."
