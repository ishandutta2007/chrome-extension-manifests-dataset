Introducing Ugh - your ultimate tool for user-generated hate (ugh*)! Yes, we know, \"hate\" is a strong word, but sometimes, expressing strong disapproval is essential.\n\nWith Ugh, you can effortlessly downvote, thumbs-down, unlike, or simply \"hate\" any website with just a single click. Say goodbye to silently fuming over frustrating online experiences - now you have the power to make your discontent known!\n\nBut Ugh goes beyond just expressing your displeasure. Unlike other platforms where comments are censored or restricted, Ugh gives you the freedom to voice your opinions uncensored. With Ugh, you can comment on absolutely anything, even when comments are blocked, paywalled, or otherwise unavailable. Your voice matters, and Ugh ensures it is heard.\n\nEasily share screenshots and post comments to provide context to your dislikes. Our built-in web-based image editor allows you to annotate and highlight specific elements, adding depth to your critiques. Whether it's a poorly designed interface, misleading information, or just a downright annoying pop-up, Ugh gives you the tools to call it out.\n\nBut Ugh isn't just about expressing individual discontent - it's about getting the pulse of other frustrated and discontent users. Join the Ugh community and connect with like-minded individuals who share your frustrations. Discover new websites to hate or find solidarity in others' grievances.\n\nNo need to fumble with external screenshotting tools - Ugh comes with screenshotting built-in. Capture those moments of online annoyance with ease, then edit and share them seamlessly.\n\nJoin the Ugh community and let your voice be heard. Together, we can raise awareness, spark change, and make the internet a better place, one dislike at a time.\n\nGet Ugh now and take control of your online experience!\n\n*(user-generated hate... yes, a strong word, but sometimes hate is good.)\n\nNote: extension modifies headers on some sites (Instagram) due to their blocking of the ability to screenshot the page."
