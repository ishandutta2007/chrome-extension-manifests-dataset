Is anything actually private? How do we monitor how vulnerable our online information is? \nThe purpose of Alienation is to playfully illustrate how personal information on the internet is not confidential and can be accessed by many entities. Many people are aware that the information they upload or retrieve from the internet is not private and can be tracked without the user knowing about it. However, few people are taking action against this phenomenon. \nBy enabling the Alienation extension, users can observe the aliens stealing certain elements from the webpage and storing it in their portal, located at the bottom of the page. Users can also interact with the aliens and by clicking and dragging them in order to impede their mission to steal webpage information. In the end, however, the user canâ€™t fully stop the aliens, a parallel for the controversial reality we live in. \n\n***We know there are bugs! We are working on fixing them as soon as possible***\nConstructive Feedback is much appreciated!"
