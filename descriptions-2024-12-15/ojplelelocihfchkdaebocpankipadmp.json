The Scopus download manager will not do anything for unauthenticated users.\n\nScopus Document Download Manager is a free browser extension enabling download functionality in Scopus, as well as a Quick Document Search function for Scopus authenticated users.  To search, authenticated users can simply click on the browser extension icon to display the search form.\n\nThis extension saves authenticated users the hassle of visiting individual publisher web sites to download documents one by one. Instead, it seamlessly connects to publisher websites to download full text PDFs directly from your browser without needing to configure and maintain a list of entitlements.\n\nHow do you use this extension in Scopus?\n\n1) From the document search results or document list pages, select one or several documents and click on Download button\n\nor\n\n2) From a Scopus abstract record page, click on Download button\n\nWhen successfully downloaded, your PDF document(s) will be saved to your browser Downloads folder. In the event that the extension fails at retrieving the PDF (e.g. you are not entitled to the full text or the download is prevented by the publisher web site) the Document Download Manager will provide a link to the publisher web site so you can easily open the page and try to download the full text manually."
