Currently it works only for Cloud (*.atlassian.net) instances and for the newer side-nav UX.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Tooltips for Pie Chart and Filter Results gadgets will include the filter name.  This is great for multi-column dashboards where you can't see the whole gadget title and the default tooltip is the unhelpful \"Pie Chart\".\n* Status pie charts that use common status names (New, In Progress, Done, Closed) will now always use the same consistent set of colors.  Without this extension, Jira chooses colors for you, meaning that two side-by-side pie charts could have different colors for Done, New, etc.\n\nIn the future I would like to include the ability for users to add their own custom status-to-color mappings."
