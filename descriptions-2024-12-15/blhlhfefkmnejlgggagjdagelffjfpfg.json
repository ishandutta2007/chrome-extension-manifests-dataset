Follow these simple instructions to get started:\n - Select an algorithm on a webpage by highlighting the algorithm text with your mouse. Most of the common algorithm formats are supported.\n - Click on the Last Layer Alg Viewer extension icon in the browser toolbar, or press Ctrl+Shift+X, to instantly see an image of the algorithm's effect on the last layer of the 3x3 cube. More precisely, the image shows which case is solved by the algorithm.\n - Change the various display options, such as the cube color scheme and orientation, to get the image you want.\n - Right-click on the image and choose \"Save As...\" from the context menu to save the image on your computer.\n\nAnd that's it!\nWith Last Layer Alg Viewer, you can quickly and easily visualize the effects of any algorithm on the last layer of the 3x3 cube, and create images with your preferred color scheme and  optional arrows to share with your friends.  Hopefully you will find this extension useful and enjoyable to use. Happy cubing!"
