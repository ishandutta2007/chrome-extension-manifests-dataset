It may so happen that that if the element has no attributes, it tries to create shortcut with respect to text. This needs lot of improvement and this is my first experiment with chrome extensions hence kindly excuse for some trivial mistakes. \n\nLet me know if anything is not relevant or which may be missing.\n\nBelow are the few known issues which would be fixed soon.\n\n1. have to fallback on the traditional xpath if no optimized xpath found."
