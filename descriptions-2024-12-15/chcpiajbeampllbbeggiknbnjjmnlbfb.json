Simply type 'want', press Tab and type the name of the thing you want to buy, press the Enter/Return key twice to see the results of the search on Amazon.com. Enjoy!\n\nIf you want to shop on the Amazon.co.uk site, prefix your search with '.uk', for example to search for 'nexus 7' on Amazon.co.uk, type '.uk nexus 7'.\n\nIf pressing Tab does not work, make sure you type 'want' then press Backspace/Del to remove highlighted text leaving only the word 'want' in the Omnibox and press Tab again. You'll know it worked when you see the words 'definitely want' on blue background. You can now type the name of the thing you want to buy, then press the Enter/Return key twice to see the results of the search on Amazon.com."
