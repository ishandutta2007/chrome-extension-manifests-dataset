See source code at https://github.com/moribellamy/graytabby.\n\nIt supports one user flow: close all of your tabs and save them, as clickable links, in a dedicated window. Don't stress about losing a tab! De-clutter your browser and CTRL+F if you need to get something back!\n\nSo, why should you use GrayTabby?\n\nGrayTabby is simple. It focuses around one core flow: archival. Most users will get all the value they need out of this tab archiver by clicking one button.\n\nGrayTabby is open source. You can read for yourself that it doesn't share your data. You can contribute to it for everyone's benefit.\n\nGrayTabby is focused. It only asks for permission to view and modify your tabs, because that is its purpose in life."
