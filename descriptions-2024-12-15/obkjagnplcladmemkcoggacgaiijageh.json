Small businesses tend to fall in the 100-500 range.\n\nWith an account on Intently.co, you will also be able to run competitor analysis, comparing the backlink profile for your web site vs any competitor.  Intently will even find the backlinks your competitor has that you do not, so you can close the gap.\n\nThis tool is similar to the MozBar from Moz, but our research has shown that it follows Google's algorithms more closely than Moz, so it produces more reliable scores.  We have found our Rank score to be more accurate than any other metric, including those from Moz, ahrefs, Majestic, SimilarWeb, Semrush and SiteChecker.\n\nThis tool is designed to be used primarily by SEO Consultants and small to medium sized business owners, especially those who offer service to the public such as:  catering, cleaning, entertainment, health, home services, lessons, photography, property services, venues and wedding services."
