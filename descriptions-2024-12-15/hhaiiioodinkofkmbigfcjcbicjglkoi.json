You can click on a \"Wordle\" word to have it filled in for you. \n\n2a) If you click into the letters left display, you will see a chart of which letters remain and which occur most frequently in the remaining targets. \n\n3a) If you click into the best guess display, you will see a chart of the algorithm's best guess suggestions.  It's correlating number is the average number of words that would be left if the guess was played.  This can also be thought of as a \"narrowing score\". Lower is better. \n\n3b) The algorithm chart has options for normal mode, hard mode, and target words only. \n\nEven if you're not looking for insights, ReWordle helps satisfy those moments when you think \"There has to be only one word in the world that this could be!\""
