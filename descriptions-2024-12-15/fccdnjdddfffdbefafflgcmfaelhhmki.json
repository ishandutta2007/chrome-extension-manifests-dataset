Do not worry, as this extension will apply a dark theme to your PowerSchool dashboard and change the color scheme for you. This extension will also automatically calculate your unweighted grade point average (GPA) if your school has disabled the feature within PowerSchool.\n\n--------Changelog--------\n0.3.0 - BETA: See how your grade will change from editing the outcome of an assignment. This feature could be useful if a teacher hasn't put in a grade yet, and you would like to see the outcome on your PowerSchool. (This obviously doesn't actually change your grade)\n\n0.2.1 - Fix GPA calculation error (Removed classes with no grade from being counted in the average), added GPA average for all grading periods\n\n0.2.0 - Add GPA calculation support for schools that have disabled GPA calculation, add toggle options for dark theme and GPA calculation\n\n0.1.1 - Fix unreadable white text header on sidebar, disable dark mode on unsupported sites"
