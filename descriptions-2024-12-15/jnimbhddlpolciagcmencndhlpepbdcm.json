In most installations of Chrome, you'll have to enable panels manually.  The extension should guide you through the process if you have panels disabled. \n\nNaturally, because Panels are experimental, you should expect quirks here and there.  Please understand that I have no control of this, and it will be up to Google to address such issues in time. \n\n******** Note ********\n\nIf you ever have any issues with Grooveplayer, please submit a bug report through the Chrome Store.  While you're waiting for a fix to come out, refreshing the Grooveshark page should temporarily fix most problems you're having.  \n\nAlso feel free to request new features and ask me any questions about Grooveplayer that you may have.  This can all be done through the Chrome Store."
