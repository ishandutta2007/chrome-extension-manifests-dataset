You visually pinpoint the issue/task/bug in the browser and then manage the issue using JIRA.\n\nTracey - Bug Cop for JIRA is a lot like Capture for JIRA but without the annotation feature. It does screenshots fast, and clearly indicates the problem area.\n\nI don't know why anyone would want to use JIRA. It is so clunky, slow and ugly compared to Trello. Anyhow, people want it so here it is, but I personally prefer Trello.\n\nLove Tracey"
