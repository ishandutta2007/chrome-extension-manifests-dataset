Visited Links Marker changes the color of the link that you have previously visited according to your browser history\n2. you can choose any color\n3. you can choose which websites the extension will run on\n\nWHY IS IT USEFUL?\n- If you read blogs, do research, watch videos etc., you will immediately see any articles or videos you have previously clicked on. So you don't have to consume them again.\n- It will be easier to navigate the website because the links you often click on will be a different color so you'll see them immediately.\n\nEXTENSION DEVELOPMENT\nIf you find a bug or have an idea for an improvement, I'd love to hear your recommendations. This is the first version and I want to improve it gradually.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to this repository, feel free, just fork the project and make a pull request (https://github.com/nathandev33/Visited-Links-Marker)"
