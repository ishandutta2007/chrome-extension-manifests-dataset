The albums that the user can select from are the same as the ones listed on the \"Albums\" page of their Google Photos, and includes albums shared with the user.\n\nThe user can also click on the photo to zoom in, which also changes the background to a dark grey.\n\nOnce an album is selected the extension selects a random photo from the album to display.\n\nAdditionally, the background changes with each picture - using the most dominant color of the image as the background for the page.\n\n____\n\nIcons made by Smashicons (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons)\nfrom Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/) \nlicensed by Creative Commons BY 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)"
