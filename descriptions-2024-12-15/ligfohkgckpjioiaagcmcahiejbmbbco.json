Eye Fresh is designed to help users apply the 20-20-20 rule to their workflow. The 20-20-20 rule is a guideline which advises that for every 20 minutes spent on a digital device, the user should take a 20 second break and look at something 20 feet away. Applying the 20-20-20 rule is intended to reduce digital eye strain caused by looking at digital screens for extended periods of time. \n\nEye Fresh will send the user a notification to help facilitate the 20-20-20 rule. To get the full Eye Fresh experience, please ensure that your computer is configured to receive notifications from Google Chrome. Mac users may take the following steps to configure their system: \n\n1. Go to “System Settings”\n2. Click on “Notifications” \n3. Under “Application Notifications”, find Google Chrome and click the slider for “Allow Notifications”\n4. Customize notifications to your liking"
