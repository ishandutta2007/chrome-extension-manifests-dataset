There's no need to close it manually.\n\nAs soon as the tab is opened by Slack, a 10 second timer will begin. When the timer reaches 0, the tab will close. It's that simple! This countdown starting value can be changed in the settings.\n\nThis extension is also privacy focused. It has no analytics or tracking, nor any external dependencies.\n\nPlease note this extension is not endorsed by or affiliated with Slack.\n\nThe icon for this extension was created and designed by, my friend, Danial. ❤️"
