This is a dead project! It's not supported anymore, so there is no guarantee that it will work on latest browser's versions.\n\nIt is useful for developers or testers who often need to open Fisheye Commit Graph views of different repositories.\nAll you need is to describe your repos in the Options (only one time after installation) and insert key-words using autocomplete.\n\nGetting started\nAfter extension is installed into Chrome you need to define Options (Options link in the extensions page chrome://extensions/): URL of Fisheye and Repository key-words and codes.\nAfter options are saved open extension, insert key-word of repo (there is autocomplete for all key-words), click Enter and extension will open required Commit Graph page.\n\nGitLab repo: https://gitlab.com/irina-ivanova-extensions/Fisheye-Commit-Graph-Opener"
