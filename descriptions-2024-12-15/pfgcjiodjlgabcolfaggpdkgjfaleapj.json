Clicking that will take you to more information about the send service that delivered the email. Links to their website, their privacy policies and anti-spam policies. We also provide email contacts for the service provider themselves so you can contact directly if you need to make a complaint.\n\nYou are also able to leave public feedback about the vendor based on the types of message you have seen from them, directly on the SenderIntelligence website."
