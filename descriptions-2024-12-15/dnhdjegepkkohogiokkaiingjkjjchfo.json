ServeJoy helps you build a daily habit of \"micro-serving\" through a simple way of committing to one small way to serve those around you every single day.  Micro-serving is a simple and intentional way to serve others every day.  There are plenty of ways to do what you love while partnering with your community.  Seeing the thankful faces of people you helped should give you more than enough fulfillment.  There’s no greater feeling than being someone else’s reason for being happy.  By using the ServeJoy app, you can share your experiences with your friends and family and inspire others to serve each other every day!  Experience the Joy of Serving others every day!\n\nSeveral different ideas on ways to micro-serve every day include:\n\n✓ Sign up to teach kids how to read \n\n✓ Be the storyteller yourself at your local library\n\n✓ Inviting a co-worker to Church\n\n✓ Offering to help a friend move\n\n✓ Volunteering at the local shelter\n\n✓ Visit the local Senior Center \n\n✓ Tutor a student\n\n✓ Fix & Serve meals\n\n✓ Serve on a community board\n\n✓ Volunteer at the Humane Society\n\n- BE IN AWE OF CREATION EVERY DAY -\nOften we get caught up in our own little world and do not get to experience God's vast creation, other cultures, different people and unique customs.  Spending a few minutes a day looking at a different picture and reading about the will grow your faith in God and help you experience the diverse world God has created.  We have named the location picture and description: “1l31”.  Genesis 1:31 - “God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.”   1l31 Start your day by experiencing the beauty and wonder of a God’s creation with a new picture every day and learn about what makes this location unique.  You can Favorite, Share and Comment on every location picture and description with your friends and family.  \n\nExamples include:\n\n✓ 1l31 - Lago di Braies, Italy:  \nThe Lake Braies ( Pragser Wildsee in German ) is a small alpine lake located in the Braies Valley (a side valley of the Puster Valley ) at 1,496 m above sea level in the municipality of Braies ( BZ ), about 97 km from Bolzano.  To reach the lake, take the junction for the Val di Braies, between the towns of Monguelfo and Villabassa in Alta Pusteria.  You can make a tour around the shores of the lake. This route is on the western shore, flat and wide, while on the eastern shore it is steep and narrow, with some stairways. Nevertheless this beautiful walk that leads to the feet of the Croda del Becco , can be faced by any hiker.\n\n✓ 1l31 - Grindelwald, Village in Switzerland:  \nGrindelwald, a village in Switzerland’s Bernese Alps, is a popular gateway for the Jungfrau Region, with skiing in winter and hiking in summer. It's also a base for mountain-climbing ascents up the iconic north face of Eiger Mountain. Gletscherschlucht, a glacial gorge just outside Grindelwald, features paths with interpretive signage, waterfalls and striated limestone walls.\n\n✓ 1l31 - Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre, Riomaggiore:  \nRiomaggiore is a village and comune in the province of La Spezia, situated in a small valley in the Liguria region of Italy. It is the first of the Cinque Terre one meets when travelling north from La Spezia.\n \n- BE INSPIRED & MOTIVATED EVERY DAY -\nServeJoy displays a new motivational quote with mini devotional on a daily basis.
