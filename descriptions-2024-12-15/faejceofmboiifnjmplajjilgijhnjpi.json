Why did no-one think of this before?\"\n\n \"ProspectSafari saves us about 30 hours per month for each sales person. It provides automated list generation and data extraction but then presents the list in the most obvious and efficient way for us to apply human judgment.\"\n\n  \"We have purchased mailing lists before but they are of poor quality. By generating fresh, current data ProspectSafari is a lower cost and more efficient alternative.\"\n\n  \"We need to review all the businesses of a certain type in each target region. We need to know what back-end systems are connected to their website. By exploring the website we need to quickly categorize each prospect using our A/B/C system and add some key observations. We need an email and phone number for each. We then send marketing emails from Hubspot or MailChimp based on the collected data. NOTHING is as good as ProspectSafari for this process.\"\n\n \"We are looking for very specific M&A target companies. Using ProspectSafari's automated search, I have done in 2 hours what our intern couldn't achieve in 2 weeks.\"\n\n  \"This is a perfect compliment to our Hubspot CRM: fast prospect generation & data extraction, and an efficient way for us to categorize prospects based on their website information\"\n\n    \"We now use ProspectSafari as the CRM for our new business sales team.\""
