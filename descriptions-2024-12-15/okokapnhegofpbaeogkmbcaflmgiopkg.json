You can aim the projector at a rectangular area, where you want your source feed to appear.\n\nUse your webcam, your screen or any window open on your desktop as a source. You can correct the source (perspective, rotate, flip) by dragging each corner. Additionally you can crop out a rectangular area in case the source feed contains stuff you don't need.\n\nMappertje also integrates directly with my other extension: Pop-out Jitsi Meet:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pop-out-jitsi-meet/boklbbjieahngbnhdmlhldjjibdnnbcn\nWhen you've got both extensions installed you can also use all (remote) videos in the Jitsi conference as a source for projection mapping."
