When you open a receipt on the site in the My Activity page, it detects the receipt and makes it available for you to download via a CSV.\n\n\nData security\nThis extension runs only on the Everyday Rewards website and does not interact with any external servers at all. Your data is not transmitted anywhere - it stays completely in your browser.\n\n\nWoolworths non-affiliation\nThis is not an official Woolworths extension or affiliated with Woolworths in any way."
