This extension has the ability to include images and iframes in the summarized articles, making certain articles significantly more \"readable\".\n2. It provides more options for epub generation, including a fix for 'pre' tags so they're rendered in fixed-width font.\n3. It is open source, so if things don't work well, they can be changed.\n4. It doesn't come with a PDF printer adapter, so if you want to print PDFs to your remarkable, you should still keep the \"Read on reMarkable\" extension."
