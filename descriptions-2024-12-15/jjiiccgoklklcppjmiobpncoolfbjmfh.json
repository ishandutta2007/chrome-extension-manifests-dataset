Not have to be worried if someone is too populer to message?\n\nWell I think so!\n\nTo use this extention its really simple. \n\n1) Install the extention.\n2) Go to MyLOL and navigate around the site a bit (click a few links for 10 minutes)\n3) Log out and back in.\n4) Enjoy!\n\nIf you have any issues please message before leaving a bad review."
