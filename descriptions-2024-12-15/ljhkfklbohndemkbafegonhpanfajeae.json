If by changes in code or some other reason blocking module fails there is always clicking module.\n\nSadly Chrome doesn't support blocking module :((( \nClicking module still works.\nOnly Firefox users can use YouTube with absolutely no interruptions.\n\nAll blocked, unnecessary stuff can take up to 48% of data sent to your browser !!!\n\nI used many extension and they all have some defects, so i wrote one for myself, and i want to share it with you.\n\nWorks on any popup (big, small, on left and right ;) ), but in particular:\n- Sign in to YouTube\n- Video paused. Continue watching?\n- Age confirmation\n- YouTube Music ad\n- Chrome ad\n- Make a donation to this channel\n- You are not using a YouTube account\n- and probably every annoying popup YT adds later...\nCookies popup excluded by default (can be enabled in options).\n\nUnlike other similar extensions:\n- has two modes that work simultaneously\n- blocking works on 5 different YT network data responses\n- blocking works on 6 different YT source codes\n- it shouldn't slow down your browser\n- it works even if tab is not selected\n- should work with future popups\n\nKnown issues:\n- (blocking module) if there is \"ERROR\" instead % in stats box(lower left corner) or video won't load it means that Google changed something in code or requests and blocking module will not work until i come across the same variant and make update\n- (blocking module) when using back and forward button data will not change because of cache\n- (clicking module) when login popup is tamed and you quickly load another video it may appear and be tamed once again (popup needs couple hundred ms to execute code)\n- (clicking module) there are some yt functions that uses popup container and should be excluded (e.g. if you're logged in the whole menu after clicking avatar in top right corner - this one is the only one excluded for now)\n\nDevelopment roadmap:\n- \"Get the best YouTube experience, Sign in to save videos, subscribe, and more\" - error message in video container\n\nIt also clicks \"Skip Ad\" button when ad comes up (mainly for leftovers after Adblock).\nDoes not interfere with the Adblock Plus extension.\nIf you have any suggestions write me.\n\nThis extension will always be free.\nIf this extension made your life a bit easier and you want it to be further developed please make tiny donation, it would mean a lot to me.\nPayPal: http://www.bit.ly/382is5H\n\nThanks!"
