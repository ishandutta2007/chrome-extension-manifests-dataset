This extension helps our employees to log daily time entries and get updates for their tasks on a daily basis. The employee needs to login using this extension and start their time entries using this tool.\n\nThey can choose the Project/Sprint/Tasks they are working on and start their time entry on that. They can also create tasks using this extension for their team members. There is a browser interface to login into this app as well, which you can find here: https://csl-console.uc.r.appspot.com/\n\nIn future, there will be a desktop notification for all users to remind them about their current running task and also reminders for Lunch and coffee Breaks on specific time intervals."
