This tool takes search volume for individual brands and their categories and calculates share of search for each brand on a monthly basis and shows you year-over-year changes so you can quickly predict market share changes for your brand(s). Just type a brand name into Google and instantly get last month's YoY change in Share of Search.  This saves about 45 minutes of work each time you use it, depending on the number of competitors in your brand's category."
