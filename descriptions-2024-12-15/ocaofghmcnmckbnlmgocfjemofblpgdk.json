There are times when you are listening to a playlist and wish there was an easier way to skip to the next song rather than going through the description and comments, and finding that one comment that has the timestamps in it. Well, look no further, Youtime can do that for you! Just load up the comments and hit the extension, you will find all the timestamps that exist in the comment and the description section.\n\nBut wait up, its not just hour long playlists that Youtime helps, but also the short videos which has all the interesting sections mentioned in the comments by other users, you will be able to see that too."
