Trying to decide which section has the best professor? No more! This extension searches Rate my Prof for professor data any time you use the timetable website, and adds that information to the website's section information! If you want to read students' comments click the professor's name and you will get a new tab straight to the professor's page!\n\nChanges to the UofO Timetable website are:\n1. The professor's name is now a link to their RMP page.\n2. A column that contains each professor's RMP data has been added on the right-hand side.\n\nTo see the results of this extension, see the screenshot!\n\n*Note: Some professor's will not have a link nor will there be RMP data for two reasons. Either the professor's information is entered under a different name in the Rate my Prof system, or the professor may not have a RMP page at all."
