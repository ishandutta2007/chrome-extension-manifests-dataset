Guardrails for Gmail and Google Inbox is a lightweight browser extension that fixes that.\n\nGuardrails will give you a heads up when you're sending an email to folks outside your organization or mixing external people in with internal contacts. It'll also give you some peace of mind when you're only talking to people in your own organization.\n\nThis extension is open sourced at https://github.com/michaelschade/guardrails."
