If you hover over these links, it will show you how much ETH the address has and how many transactions it has.\n\n🔍 Block Explorer - search the blockchain with an 0x address or transaction hash and get human readable results.\n\n🏷️ Add Labels to Addresses - No need to remember the long hex string if you can add human readable labels to addresses. Create your own address book that is integrated with the block explorer functionality.\n\n🚫 Block you from malicious domains - EAL keeps a daily-updated blacklist of known phishing domains to help you keep your funds/secrets secure. The blacklist is saved locally to the extension every 10 minutes to keep your privacy intact. The only time you hit a 3rd party service is when the extension caches the blacklists - services are Github.\n\n✔️ History Checker - Along with the domain blocker, there is also a history checker to analyze your browser history to alert you if you've been on a now-known bad domain.\n\n📑 Bookmark your favourite domains - having easy reliable links to domains you trust. These bookmarks are displayed in the top of the extension window and are 100% controlled by you.\n\n✏️ Custom RPC node - don't rely on us for the data if you run your own node. Go into the extension settings and set your own RPC node to use. EAL comes with a node provided by Quiknode on mainnet, but feel free to change it to one you control on any Ethereum network.\n\n🐦 Twitter Trust Badges - to combat the phishing/scamming on Twitter, EAL will inject a trust-badge next to the Twitter handle to show if it is to be trusted. Data is sourced from hiveone.\n\nFull details and changelog: https://harrydenley.com/ethaddresslookup-chrome-extension-release/\n\nEAL will also show you a popup container (non-intrusive) detailing the ETH balance of an address, the number of transactions going OUT, and if the address is a smart contract - The RPC node is managed by https://quiknode.io, so mega-thanks to those guys!\n\nCurrently in BETA phase.\nPush issues to https://github.com/409H/EtherAddressLookup\n\nDonation address: 0x661b5dc032bedb210f225df4b1aa2bdd669b38bc"
