Browse through, generate and customize color palettes while applying them to any website simultaneously, all with just a few tweaks in the code.\n\nChromafy helps users apply color palettes to any website. User can generate different color palettes, customize them, export them as css code or download as a file, and go to previously selected palettes. These palettes are then applied to the website in the background when the extension is launched. The user has to give certain class names to html elements or use css variables and the appropriate colors will be given to those elements. It can be helpful for users who want to select the best colors for their website on their own website as a playground.\n\nExample showing use of class names to apply color palettes:\nclass = \"bg-chroma-secondary-25\"\nApplies the secondary color from your palette with 25% opacity to the background (CSS background-color property) of an element.\n\nclass = \"fg-chroma-primary\"\nApplies the primary color from your palette to the foreground text (CSS color property) of an element.\n\nCSS variables can be used similarly, it does not require specifiying \"bg\" or \"fg\":\n<css-selector>{\n  background-color: var(--chroma-primary-75, #fff);\n}\n\nrefer to the documentation here to understand everything related to Chromafy: https://chromafy.vercel.app/docs/setup\n\n\nUpdates:\n\n• Version 1.2\n        - reduced extension size by 90%\n     1.2.2\n        - UI bug fix: export popup now closes on clicking close button\n\n• Version 1.1\n        - rearranged buttons, updated icons\n        - added information card"
