UR, map problem and camera details can be displayed in a pop-up by hovering over the marker without needing to click on the marker.\n\nIncludes a camera watchlist feature, allowing users to mark certain cameras which URO will then monitor for any changes in their properties (useful if you find some of the cameras you maintain keep on being marked as \"not there\" and end up changing back to unapproved...)\n\nAlso includes improvements to the Drives tab (shows more drives per page and informs the user which drives can be clicked on to show the route taken) and provides a \"Select All\" button when a roundabout (traffic circle) segment is selected, so that the entire roundabout can then be selected with a single click."
