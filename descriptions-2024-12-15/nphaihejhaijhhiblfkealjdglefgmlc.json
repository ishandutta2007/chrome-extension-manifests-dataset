When I am on Trakt.tv and want to see a new movie I have to navigate to Netflix and search for the same title just to add it to my Netflix queue. So I decided to make this little extension. When I am on a Trakt.tv page for a movie, I click the little Netflix logo. That creates a new tab with a Netflix search including the name of the film. Typically the first DVD is the page for the movie. So I click that link and then add it to my queue. Simple as that. It is also worth noting that this works with IMDB as well. If you click while on a movie page from there."
