Edit the\nformula that appears in the interactive formula editor. Press enter to\nconvert it into a picture. (You have to exit the formula editor via\nenter, otherwise the picture will not be updated.)\n\nTo edit an existing formula, either click on it, or position the cursor after it and press Ctrl-M.\n\nSee the Wiki (https://github.com/dominique-unruh/mathquill-for-gmail/wiki) for more information.\n\n[1] Please note that if you are generating a lot of equations from a\nsingle domain, i.e. over 3000/day, then you may need to arrange a\ncommercial licence with CodeCogs to support continued hosting of the\nservice. Please see their terms and conditions:\nhttp://www.codecogs.com/latex/usage.php.\n\n*Privacy note:* The formulas rendered by this app are image links to the CodeCogs server. This means that the CodeCogs server will learn the content of the formulas (but not the text between them) when editing and when reading the email. No other information is transmitted by the extension."
