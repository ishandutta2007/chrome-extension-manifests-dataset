All you need is a couple of clicks, and that’s it!\n\nFeatures and benefits:\n* Add and switch between multiple proxies\n* One-click connection\n* Use multiple proxy providers while using only one extension\n* Maintain the same IP address for multiple requests\n* Switch between any proxy type or HTTP(S) and SOCKS protocols\n* Add unlimited proxies\n* WPAD: proxy information is not displayed in the request header.\n\nHow to set up Oxy® Proxy Extension?\n \n1.
