It provides a reliable solution for copying text-based information from images. Example use cases include extracting text from screenshots of user profiles, error messages, transaction IDs, and more, sent by users for support purposes.\n\nDesigned with data security as paramount, ByteOCR ensures that no data is stored on a server. Instead, all extracted information is stored locally in the Flash Memory, which is automatically cleared upon computer restart — maintaining the privacy and security of user data.\n\n## Use Case\n\nByteOCR is particularly helpful when users send in screenshots for support inquiries. These can range from their profiles, error messages, to transaction numbers.\n\n## How It Works\n\nConsider the example where a user sends a screenshot of their 26-digit transaction ID:\n\n1. The associate right-clicks on the image and selects 'Copy Image Address'.\n2. Next, the associate opens the ByteOCR Chrome Extension and pastes the image address into the open box.\n3. After clicking 'Get Text', the program then extracts the text from the image into an output box. This allows the support associate to copy the text.\n4. ByteOCR also features a built-in translation function. If a support associate receives a screenshot of an error message in a different language, they can follow steps 1-3, and then click the 'Translate' button. This opens Google Translate, where the extracted text can be pasted and translated into the language of their choice.\n\n## Creators\n\nByteOCR was proudly created by:\n- Steve Amani\n- Vidhi Mehta\n- Evan Tharp"
