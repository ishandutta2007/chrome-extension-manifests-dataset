It is beta so may have some issues! The Gmail support still works fine. If Chrome warns you about a permissions change this is because I had to add mail.com as an a site the extension can access, and I altered the Gmail access a little to cover some cases where it may not have been running when it should have been.\n\nConfused with how to access these options?
