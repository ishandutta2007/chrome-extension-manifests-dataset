The goal of this handshake is to understand when your computer system becomes idle or locked, which in turn will change your Engage presence status from \"Online! Chat Now\" to offline. The goal being to prevent you showing as \"Online!\" when you've stepped away from your computer terminal. Additional system activity monitored can include keyboard and mouse events to determine when your are inactive, then set you to away or offline status after a pre-determined amount of time.  The inactivity period by default is set to 1 minute (60 seconds)."
