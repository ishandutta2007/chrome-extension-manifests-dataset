With regular scans, all of your web content will remain compliant. Uploaded documents can be scanned before they are even added to your page so that you know that you are reaching 100% of your potential client base, rather than ignoring 1 in 4 of your clients.\n\nMore importantly, you will know that you are guiding your company in the right direction by being as inclusive as possible with all of your communication. Best of all, RioGlobal's new Chrome plugin for Accessbot.io is free.\n\nOnce you add Accessbot.io to your website, you simply click on its icon in the upper right corner of your webpage. Accessbot.io runs a diagnostic test on that page to check for Section 508 violations. Not only that, Accessbot.io also rates the severity of those violations so that your company knows the extent to which your electronic communications are out of compliance.\n\nAdditionally, Accessbot.io can report exactly which sections of your electronic communications are out of compliance and then recommend coding solutions to bring your website into compliance. Furthermore, Accessbot.io generates easy-to-read reports that indicate your compliance score and which violations are more critical than others, allowing you to quickly determine how to best resolve issues.\n\nFor additional information regarding Accessbot.io, please visit our website or contact us today. We will be happy to provide demonstrations and quotes depending on your company's needs."
