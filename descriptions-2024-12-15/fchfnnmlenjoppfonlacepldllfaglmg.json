This can make text more ambiguous. \n* There is not a one-to-one mapping between English pronouns of different genders, so sometimes there are two possible substitutions i.e. \"his\" -> \"her\" OR \"his\" -> \"hers\".\n* Not all gender specific words are covered.\n* Sometimes words unrelated to gender get changed by accident. For example they may have a similar/identical spelling to a gender-specific word. \n\nSource Code: https://github.com/peterwestmacott/genderblinder"
