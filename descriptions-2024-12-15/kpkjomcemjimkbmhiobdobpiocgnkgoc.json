Speed dial to your favorite sites without the need to load a new tab first.\n\n***\nThis is a special Startup edition of SiteLauncher that features carefully chosen links to tools and resources for Startups.\n***\n\nJust click the red triangle — or press the keyboard hotkey, Ctrl+M by default — for single tap access to your predefined list of top favorite websites.\n\nYou can open sites from the \"Launcher\" speed-dial panel by custom single key shortcuts, arrow keys & [enter] navigation or by mouse/touch click. Whichever way works best for you.\n\nKeyboard Examples: open Facebook by pressing Ctrl + M + F or open Google by Ctrl + M + G. The default hotkey can also be changed from Ctrl + M to something else (pro-tip: many prefer to set it to Ctrl + Space). And of course you can setup similar shortcuts to any URLs/sites you wish, as well as delete and edit the built-in defaults.\n\nSiteLauncher is free to use and doesn't contain any spyware (and we promise to never add any).\n\nFeature Highlights:\n\n* The Launcher gives you a quick and beautiful way access to your favorite sites\n\n* Pick a theme that suits your style. Includes four free beautiful themes with additional premium themes available.\n\n* The Shortcut Manager makes it easy to add, edit and remove shortcuts. Each shortcut can point to any URL/site you wish.\n\n* Option to set a custom keyboard letter to each site gives you super-fast keyboard tap navigation from the Launcher\n\n* Cloud ready. Shortcuts are stored as special bookmarks and are therefore automatically kept in sync across multiple computers if you use a Google Chrome account.\n\n* Group related shortcuts together for quick visual scanning of the Launcher.\n\n* Security and privacy—the SiteLauncher extension does not monitor, collect or transit any personal data about you, ever. And we intend to keep it that way.\n\n----------\n\nSiteLauncher is made by DoneSmart Ltd - makers of the popular SiteLauncher add-on for Firefox.\n\nSiteLauncher is subject to the following Terms of Use and Privacy Policy:\n\nTerms of Use: http://www.donesmart.com/tos.html\nPrivacy policy: http://www.donesmart.com/sitelauncher/chrome/privacy.html\n\nCopyright DoneSmart Ltd.
