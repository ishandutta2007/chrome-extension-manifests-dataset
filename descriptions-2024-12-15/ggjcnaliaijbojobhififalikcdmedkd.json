All you need to get started is a webcam.\n\nBlissify uses your webcam to monitor your facial expressions in real-time as you browse the internet. Upon detecting a rapid increase in negative emotions, Blissify will hide the page you are currently viewing before adding it to your personal block list.\n\nAfter running Blissify for the first time you will be asked to do a quick calibration: this is so Blissify knows what your 'neutral browsing expression', or NBE, looks like. Sensitivity can be adjusted until you find a negativity avoidance level that works for you."
