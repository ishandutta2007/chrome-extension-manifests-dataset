Passit is an open-source, cloud-based password manager that is secure, trustworthy, and useful.\n\nSecurity that works\n\nPassit leans on established security protocols, using the well established libsodium for public key cryptography, secret key cryptography, and secure hashing. The result is a system where Passit’s operator doesn’t know and can’t decrypt what passwords are stored. Even if an attacker could compromise a Passit server, he or she would still need a user’s password to make sense of the data.\n\nTrust, by verifying\n\nOpen source code means you don’t have to take us at our word. Closed source software provides no way for you to validate the security model. Backdoors or flaws can be introduced at any time without your knowledge. Our open source model combined with the ability to self-host means you can trust that Passit is doing what it claims to do.\n\nPassit anywhere, to anyone\n\nEasily take your passwords to any online device and share them with others. Read existing passwords when offline, just in case. Passit stores your passwords online, so if your device has an Internet connection, you can access all of your sensitive information on it. Group features will allow you to share your passwords with friends, family, or coworkers."
