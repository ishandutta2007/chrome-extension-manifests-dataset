This extension allows the customer to view the transactions accessible to them in their browser's local storage which is where the recent payment information is stored. For the average person, this blob of information is difficult to decipher. This extension reads the blob of data and presents key information such as the purchase amount, the state of the transaction, the refund amount if applicable, the receipt URL, etc. in concise rows. The user may select which transaction they would like to view on shop.wdny.io by clicking a button to set the transaction as the active transaction."
