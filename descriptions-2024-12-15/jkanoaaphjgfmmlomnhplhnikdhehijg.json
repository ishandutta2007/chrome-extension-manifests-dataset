Stressed, sad, or even happy, 'Fetch!' has got your back.  On whichever website you're browsing, activate 'Fetch!' and you can fetch yourself a photo of a dog to display in your browser.  Get a dog from a random breed, or from one of the breeds offered in the dropdown.  Once you've had your fill, get back to your previous display by simply closing out of the image.\n\nNote: Fetch! does not work in a \"New Tab.\"  You must be in an actual webpage for Fetch! to function properly."
