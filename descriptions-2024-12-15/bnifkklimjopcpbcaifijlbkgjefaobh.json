With it, you are able to edit the DOM of any website and create fun and cool effects that you wouldn't normally find on the original site. New features to DOMinate and destroy websites are always being developed, and community help is always appreciated. So, are you ready for absolute DOMination?\n\nHave fun with the tool and leave a review with any feedback!\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nTHIS TOOL IS CLIENT SIDE ONLY! THIS MEANS IT IS ONLY VISUAL! Like most HTML editing extensions, this only changes the look/info of the site on your side, since we don't have access to the main source code.\n\nI am not responsible for anything you do with this tool, it is purely for fun and just a general utility.\n\nThanks for downloading!"
