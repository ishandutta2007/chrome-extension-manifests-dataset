Using image recognition and a lot of non-scientific assumptions you get a peak into the future of tech glasses. Will the world look different? Are you acting differently when you can't see and interpret a large part of the populations eyes?\n\nIn case you have privacy concerns: No data leaves your computer. Every calculation is done locally.\nThis is more of a digital art piece than a functional tool. I wanted to play with the future. If electronics like Magic Leap get popular, how will it look? I thought the browser could be as good a place as any to test it and travel forward in time.\n\nNote: Sometimes  my code makes mistakes. Please don't be offended :) It's just \"art\" or whatever.\nWhile I've focused on decent fast code it's not super optimised or maintained. If you experience bad performance or your favourite website has become unreadable because of massive glasses, I suggest uninstalling the extension again.\n\nThanks for trying\n@evryone_XR"
