With Claude’s integration, we’re taking the next step forward. The aiComputerUse command allows you to automate complex tasks with a single line of code that would traditionally require hundreds of lines of classic Ui.Vision commands (such as XClick, OCRExtractScreenshot, If/then statements, and more). For example, you can teach Ui.Vision to play TicTacToe with just one short \"Play this game...\" prompt.\n\n--\nUi.Vision is an open-source automation RPA software that combines classic browser automation with modern computer vision and OCR:\n\n(1) **Visual Browser Automation**\n\nUi.Vision's visual UI testing commands assist web designers and developers in checking and ensuring the accuracy of website layouts and canvas elements. It can identify and read images and text within canvas elements, images, and videos.\n\n(2) **Visual Desktop Automation for Windows, Mac, and Linux**\n\nBeyond web browser automation, Ui.Vision uses image and text recognition (OCR) to automate browser extensions and desktop environments as well. It can interpret images and text on the desktop, executing actions like clicking, moving, dragging and dropping the mouse, and simulating keyboard inputs.\n\nThis desktop automation requires installing the free Ui.Vision XModules, available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. These modules provide Ui.Vision with the necessary capabilities for desktop interaction.\n\n(3) **Selenium IDE compatible commands**\n\nUi.Vision includes Selenium-style commands for web automation, testing, form filling, and web scraping. Learning Ui.Vision also means learning Selenium IDE, and vice versa. \n\nHowever, Ui.Vision differs in philosophy from the classic Selenium IDE. Ui.Vision offers features not found in the classic Selenium IDE, including computer vision for UI testing, image comparison, file download automation, OCR screen scraping, PDF testing, and capturing full web page and desktop screenshots.\n\n**Command Line API**\n\nUi.Vision provides a detailed command line API for integration with other applications, often used with Jenkins, CI/CD tools, or the Windows task scheduler. It can be automated and controlled using any programming or scripting language, such as Python or PowerShell.\n\n**Open-Source (AGPL license)**\n\nThe Ui.Vision extension source code is available on Github. This makes Ui.Vision a good open-source Selenium IDE alternative and iMacros alternative.\n\n**100% Local Software**\n\nFree and Open-Source. No cloud and no subscription. No recurring payments. The software  does not send any data back to us or any other place. Everything, including image recognition and OCR processing, is done locally on your machine. \n\nThe only exception to the \"all data is processed locally\" rule is if you select an optional online OCR engine or the AI Computer Use commands. All cloud-features are disabled by default. Only when you explicitly enable them in the settings does Ui.Vision send screenshots to cloud services. The default OCR options are Javascript OCR or XModule OCR, which both run 100% locally on the machine.\n\n**Happy Automating!**\n\nFor questions and suggestions, please visit the Ui.Vision community forum at https://forum.ui.vision.",
    "de,zh_CN": "Kantu is the most popular open-source web macro recorder. If there’s an activity you have to do repeatedly, just create a web macro for it. The next time you need to do it, the entire macro will run at the click of a button and do the work for you.\n\nKantu's main focus is ease of use, good recording and reliable playback for all kinds of browser automation projects. It is a record & replay tool for automated testing and a \"swiss army knife\" for general web automation, automating file uploads and autofill form filling. It is also intended as an open-source alternative to iMacros and Selenium IDE.\n\nFirefox Selenium IDE users, please note: The current version supports the most commonly used \"Selenese\" commands, but not all. => We are adding new commands as needed. So if you miss a command that you need for your test automation work, please let us know.\n\nThe more feedback we get about a certain missing command or feature, the higher it moves in the \"todo\" list :-)\n\nPlease send feedback and questions to \nteam AT a9t9.com\n\nHomepage/Docs:\nhttps://a9t9.com/kantu/web-automation/chrome"
