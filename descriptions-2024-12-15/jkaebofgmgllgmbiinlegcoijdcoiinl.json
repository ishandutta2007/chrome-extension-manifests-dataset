One possible explanation of this strange and pertexing effect is that mind of a reader is concentrated on understanding the meaning and structure of the text, and after finishing reading a sentence many readers won't go back to check the meaning of unfamiliar words that they have already forgot. E.g. some readers will forget to check the definition of word \"pertexing\" from the previous sentence which, in fact, doesn't exist. And even if you did check it, you still can try this extension, it highlights only real Japanese dictionary words and idioms =) \n\nThe source code is here if you are curious: https://github.com/cyj98/JapaneseHighlight\n\nThis extension if a fork of mechatroner's word-discoverer, which can be found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/word-discoverer-expand-yo/noncaeikjgpbdeoocblijjgegnobogib.\n\nYou can also check my modified English version which use better frquency list and deinflector(can interpret dogs to dog etc.): https://github.com/cyj98/word-discoverer\n\nHere are some features of the extension: \n\nDepending on your vocabulary size, you can adjust frequency threshold of highlighted words e.g. skip 8000 most common Japanese words, and highlight all the rest. There's no way to set such threshold for idioms and proverbs, the extension can either highlight all of them or none.  \n\nJapanese Highlighter can operate in two modes:\nIn the first (default) mode it highlight all Internet pages except sites that you add to a special list. E.g. you may not want to highlight anything from youtube.\nIn the second mode Japanese Highlighter highlights only sites from another special list - your favorite Japanese sites. By default this list is empty, so unless you add there something (e.g. facebook, wikipedia), it won't highlight anything at all.\n\nCurrently there are 84364 words in the extension's dictionary. If you're interested you can look at them on project's github page. \n\nIf you known definition of a highlighted word, you can add it to your personal vocabulary and it won't be detected any more. You can always view your vocabulary or save it as a text file.\n\nBy selecting text of a word (or idiom) and right clicking on it you can either add the word to your vocabulary or view it's definition in one of 4 online dictionaries using context menu references. And, of course, you can also use Japanese Highlighter in combination with your favorite dictionary app (e.g. \"Google dictionary\" extension)You can also use custom dictionary.",
