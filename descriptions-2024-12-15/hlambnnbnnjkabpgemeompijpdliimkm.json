CardPointers helps you get the most out of your credit card offers and category bonuses, automatically.\n\nAuto-add every one of your Amex, Chase, BoA, Wells Fargo, US Bank, and Citi offers with CardPointers, and then the extension will help you use them, automatically.\n\nEveryone loves Amex and Chase Offers, but they're normally a pain to activate, one by one -- now you can automatically activate every offer as soon as you log in -- even the same offer across multiple eligible cards, all without having to ever share your bank logins.\n\nCardPointers also gives you a new way to view all of the offers across all of your cards, sort and filter every one of them by value, minimum spend, category, and more, and activate just the ones you want with a single click -- you're always in control.\n\nDo you keep forgetting to use your offers or never remember which credit card to use to earn more points when you're shopping online? Now any time you're on a website where you have an activated offer or a category bonus on your card, you'll see all of the offer & card details floating on the bottom of the site in the Shopping Pointers bar so you'll know which card to use, automatically.\n\nIt's never been easier to save money -- most users save over $750 per year!"
