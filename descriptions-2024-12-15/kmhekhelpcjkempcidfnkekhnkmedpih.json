If you've tried to do that before, you'll have noticed that it doesn't work if the search term contains more than one word (i.e. a space). That's because Metacritic uses weird search strings that replace the space with a \"+\", but Chrome assumes that a search string will replace a space with a \"%20\".\n\nIts such a simple little thing, but it's very frustrating. This extension replaces the \"%20\" with a \"+\", allowing you to add Metacritic to your search engines!\n\nThis is the search URL you need: http://metacritic.com/search/all/%s/results\n\nThis builds on FearJiri's Google-Chrome-URL-Replacer-Extension hosted on GitHub. I have added a couple of lines so that it works in a modern Chrome Browser, and icons for prettiness."
