You don't have to go back to rekhta or rekhta dictionary website again and again to know the meaning. The good and best part it works anywhere on web. \n\nFeatures supported:\n\n- On the fly results\n- Works anywhere on web\n- Provide meaning in English, Hindi and Urdu\n- Ease to use\n- Community driven open source initiative\n\nAlso it is very easy to use, let's see how:\n\nSaket searches for the query \"urdu zabaan ki ibtida\" on google but alas he doesn't know the meaning of \"ibtida\", he selects the word and a suggestion pops up for him whether he wants to search the meaning from rekhta. And after clicking it he gets the meaning at the webpage itself, he is very happy now. Also the bottom popup allows him to know the meaning in Hindi, English and Urdu as well."
