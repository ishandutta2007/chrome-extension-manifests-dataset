As a software developer and print designer, I created this extension after my own work was stolen and used without my permission by a GearLaunch seller. The extension checks for potential affiliation with GearLaunch on the site you are visiting, and warns you if there is a risk of stolen artwork being used to create low-quality products.\n\nIn the extension options, you have the ability to add or remove URLs to the safe site list. Currently, the extension does not collect any data, but in the future, my aim is to create a comprehensive list of websites associated with fraudulent GearLaunch sellers."
