Few, üòÆ the world of GPT moves so fast...\n\nThis extension was developed for people like me to utilize ChatGPT for work more efficiently. But the problem it was trying to solve was solved by recent updates to ChatGPT itself.\n\nInstead of focusing on copy-pasting prompts, I would recommend creating personal collection of conversation presets, by using \"Share\" button. This approach is much simpler, and doesn't require maintenance of external add-ons.\n\nOr explore recent MyGPTs feature, which is even more cool üòé!\n\nHope it was useful for some.\n‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you for showing interest.\n\nFYI, with OhMyPrompt, you could:\nüß† Save good prompts for later;\nü§å Use @variables in your prompts;\nüóÇÔ∏è Organize prompts into projects."
