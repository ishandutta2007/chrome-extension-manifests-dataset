This addon does that properly.\n\n• See all the replies to any post on your home instance. Local and remote replies are now loaded in parallel so there is no extra delay.\n• Interact with all the remote posts as normal. They will be fetched to your instance as needed.\n• See the actual latest 20 posts in any user's profile.\n• See up-to-date boost/favorite counts on posts.\n\nIt should work reliably on mainline Mastodon versions 4.0 and up, your mileage may vary for older instances or forks.\n\nMake sure to open the addon settings and type in the instances it should be active on!\n\n----\nIt can fetch statuses and contexts from Akkoma/Pleroma and most Misskey/FireFish/Sharkey/IceShrimp/etc instances, better compatibility is a work in progress.\n\nHowever, it can only run on Mastodon as a home server, and has been tested to work on vanilla and Glitch editions on current development version (4.3.0).\n\n----\n\nVisit the website for more info!"
