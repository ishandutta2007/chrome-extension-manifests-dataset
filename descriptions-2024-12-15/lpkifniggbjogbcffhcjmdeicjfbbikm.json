Most statistical significance calculators allow you to calculate confidence levels for binomial metrics only. However, we realize that A/B testing can expand beyond just this type of metric. The Blast A/B test calculator extension serves ALL A/B testing scenarios â€” this includes both conversion based and continuous metrics, such as average order value (AOV) and revenue per visitor (RPV). Also, the calculator allows for different confidence thresholds, as well as the option to remove outliers from the calculations.\n\nCalculation options:\n-- Binomial: Binomial test of proportions\n-- Continuous: T-test difference in two sample means\n-- Non-Parametric: Wilcoxon (or Mann-Whitney U Test). \n\nTo know which calculation best fits your data, see https://www.blastanalytics.com/blog/last-statistical-significance-calculator-youll-ever-need\n\nHelpful tips:\n-- Binomial tests have text entry boxes that allow for simple A/B test calculations. \n-- Since both the continuous and non-parametric metrics require session/visitor level data, a CSV file with the data needs to be uploaded. (see https://www.blastanalytics.com/blog/calculate-statistical-significance-for-session-based-metrics-in-ab-test for formatting tips)\n\nFor more information, go to https://www.blastanalytics.com/blast-statistical-significance-calculator.
