It supports removing messages in channels.  (Caveat: it does NOT work for chats at the moment). To turn on the ability to delete others' messages as an admin, please follow the instructions here: https://github.com/polymorphic-labs/bulk-ms-teams-message-removal-extension#turn-on-admins-wider-message-deletion-capability\n\nAlso, it removes threaded messages.\n\nATTENTION:\nThere are 2 different types of licenses. You must be an admin in order to delete other people's messages.\n\nAdmin License - If you are a Teams admin, you should choose this license. It would allow you to remove other people's messages in channels. A non-admin license will let you remove your own messages only.\n\nNon-admin License - You should choose this license if you are simply a member. Nothing prevents you from using an admin license, but you'll still only be allowed to remove your own messages.\n\nInstructions\n* Log in with your Teams login.\n* Get a license via Lemonsqueezy and enter it in the extension popup.\n* Select the target team, channel, etc..\n* Select the message sender whose messages you would like to delete.\n* Click on the Bulk Delete button.\nFor detailed instructions, please visit\nhttps://github.com/polymorphic-labs/bulk-ms-teams-message-removal-extension\n\nFor support and feature requests: please ping me at https://twitter.com/noitcudni"
