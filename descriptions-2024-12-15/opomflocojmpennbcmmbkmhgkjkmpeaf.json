Including direct links to the homepage, social media contents (twitter, discord, reddit), announcement page (medium), transaction history (etherscan, bscscan, blockchair), and the development source code (github).\n\nCoinSausage can be use as a research tool to find new projects, checking for projects' network mainnet, contract address, market condition, current price, historical charts, development, community, liquidity, and trust score ratings. To make this extension more useful, you can track favorite projects by adding them to a Watch List and calculate potential Gains/Loss by entering a purchase price and unit amounts to get the total portfolio value based on the current market price.\n\n_________________ How To Use_________________\n\n1. Search bar on the upper left can be typed in to find projects by Name or Symbol.\n\n2. Contract Address can be copy and paste.\n\n3. To create a Watch List, press \"Add to watch list\" to add. All items from the list are clickable to view. These added items will automatically be generated in the \"Watch List Portfolio Calculator\" where you can enter purchase price and unit amounts to calculate/auto-update the Gains/Loss total values.\n\n4. When a cryptocurrency is selected \"Load Price Charts & Supplies\" and \"Load Rating Scores & Sources URL\" on the bottom of the extension can be used to load the data that is needed.\n\n5. The button \"Search & Filter By Categories\" can be used to discover other Defi projects that are categorized by Analytic, Education, Play-To-Earn, NFTs, and many more. Each category will generate a list of projects sorted by highest to lowest market cap. When a coin is selected from the list, 24H data will appear, and using buttons from #4 can load other data like price charts or official sources. \n\n6. The button \"Top 100 Cryptocurrencies\" will generate a list of the top 100 and can be sorting by Highest/Lowest Market Cap or Highest/Lowest Volume. When a coin is selected from the list, using buttons from #4 can also load those data.\n\n7. Price of cryptocurrency can be converted up to 48 different countries' fiat currencies. (USD, EUR, CAD, AUS, IDR, TWD, KRW, JPY, CNY, PHP, VND, etc.)\n\n8. A notepad to use for recording dates, reminders, or special events.\n\n***Notes: There is a 50 calls limit per minute meaning every time data is generated will be considered as one call.
