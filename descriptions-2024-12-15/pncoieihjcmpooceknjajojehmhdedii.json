Do you do Bug Bounty? Or is your field of activity - OSINT? Undoubtedly, our plugin will be useful to you.\n\nThe plugin will allow you to get information about the website you are currently browsing at any time. Just click on our blue spider, and the extension will show you the IP address and domain name details. You will see the location of the object under study, its owner, open ports, and installed services. The extension receives all information from the Netlas.io service, and you can also go from the results to it to get acquainted with the data in more detail: examine the full WHOIS response, view responses, and all DNS records.\n\nIn addition, the extension can work in automatic mode, passively querying each site you open in the Netlas database and checking for vulnerabilities. To do this, simply enable Smart Logo in the extension settings, then reload the page. Now, every time you visit a site that is potentially vulnerable to some known CVE, the extension logo will change color depending on the vulnerability rating.\n\nAttention: the free use of the extension is limited to thirty requests per day without the ability to automatically scan visited sites. To expand the possibilities, you need to register on netlas.io and use your API key."
