This is especially very useful for those who take online classes or watch video tutorials online. With this, you need not pause the video and switch apps to take digital notes. Just open the popup while watching the lecture and start typing!\n\nNow, mix these two features and unlock new productivity levels by using these generic features as suited for your needs.\n\nPlease email me at asingla590@gmail.com for any bug that you discover, or if you have any feature request or suggestions."
