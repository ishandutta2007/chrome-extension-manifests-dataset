With a single click, you can capture the currently active web page, along with all linked images, PDFs, documents, and other web pages from the same domain.\n\nNB! Unfortunately, if a page includes elements that load content dynamically, such as when a button is pressed, that content cannot be saved during a download. Dynamically loaded content is only added when the page is loaded or scrolled down.\n\nVersion 2.0:\n- It is also possible to download web pages that are generated on the client side.\nVersion 2.1:\n- You can effortlessly save entire page as single HTML file.\nVersion 2.2:\n- You can download a variety of file formats, including documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, videos, audio files, and compressed archives.\n- I fixed the download issues.\n\nThis extension offers a convenient side panel for easy downloading. Quickly select the content you want to save using the built-in filters and initiate the download with a single click. All downloaded content is compressed into a ZIP file for efficient management.\n\nThe ZIP file contains an \"index.html\" file, which serves as the entry point to the downloaded web page. When opened in a web browser, the \"index.html\" file faithfully reproduces the original web page's layout, styling, and functionality, ensuring a consistent viewing experience even when offline.\n\nNB! Some websites go to great lengths to prevent anyone from downloading their content, and therefore for some websites the downloaded html may differ from the original html.\n\nWeb Page Downloader intelligently handles linked resources, updating the links within the downloaded HTML to point to the locally saved files. This ensures that all linked content, such as images, PDFs, and other web pages, remains accessible and properly rendered, providing a complete and self-contained offline copy of the web page.\n\nWhether you need to archive important web content, create offline documentation, or simply save web pages for later reference, Web Page Downloader offers a reliable and efficient solution. Its user-friendly interface and robust functionality make it an invaluable tool for anyone who frequently works with web content.\n\nHow to Use\n\nNavigate to the web page you wish to download.\nClick the Web Page Downloader extension icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup.\nSelect the items you want to download from the list and click the \"Start download\" button.\nThe extension will begin downloading the current web page, including all linked resources from the same domain (images, PDFs, documents, and other web pages).\nOnce the download is complete, a ZIP file containing the offline version of the web page will be automatically saved to your default downloads location.\nLocate the downloaded ZIP file and extract its contents to a folder of your choice.\nInside the extracted folder, you'll find an \"index.html\" file. Double-click this file to open the downloaded web page in your default browser.\nThe offline version of the web page will load, complete with all linked resources, allowing you to view and interact with it just like the original online version."
