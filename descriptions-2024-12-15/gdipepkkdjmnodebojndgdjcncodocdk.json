A proper mechanism is followed via successive phases which reduce the cost and time of the software products.  There are varieties of tasks and activities with the proper approach are followed during every single process. So, software development process is the mechanized life cycle of any development of software in a structured manner. For every single process complete set of instructions followed.\nThe software development company implements proper well-verified process methodologies during any software product development. Do you know every organization always follow one of the leading models during software development known as CMM Capability Maturity Model? The organizations and companies provided with grading systems such as ISO 9000, Six Sigma, and much more according to how well they create and undergo with the execution of processes of the software products. \nDuring school and college days we studied the software development lifecycles steps, but at that time we only mug and write during exams about what is software development life cycle. As compared to student life while working in companies only difference is to analyze the proper mechanism and implement proper strategies to reach the output during software product development. \nHere are the proper activities and steps of software engineering process –\n1.\tWhat is the requirement?\nWhat is the software product about? What are the main requirements for its development? How do customers respond to it? How easily the software products solve the customer’s problems? We have to think and analyze during the first phase of software product development.\n2.\tWhat are the proper specifications?\nHow to write the software product so it precisely describes every single task? How software Development Company describes the rigorous mathematics involve during the software product development? Specifications for Safety and security with easy to use the application are well written by the programmers.\n\n\n\n\n3.\tArchitecture of the Software\nUnder this software development, life cycle phase professionals define the abstract representation of the system. It means that the software met with the original requirements of the product. In this phase one of the most important requirements can be addressed and that is–ensuring the future requirements of the software product.\n4.\tImplementation\nThe designed system is now reduced to coding format. \n5.\tTesting\n\nWhen any software product launch to the market, then it is a beta software product which is tested by the consumers, but prior to that continuous testing undergoes during this phase by several testers and software engineers on the vivid functionality of the product.\n6.\tProper Documentation\nWhat about the future maintenance and enhancement of the software product? It is a Good idea and important task to do proper documentation of the internal design of the worked product.\n7.\tProvide Support Training \n\nAfter development, the most beautiful work comes which is responsible for any product huge demand around the market. Success and failure of product - It all depends on the Training and support provided to users who are using the software product.\n8.\tMaintenance\n\nIt is the top requirement after the launch to maintain the software adding new features, developing new features so the software is not outdated from the market. It believed that 40% of engineering work maintenance, but it is not true the maintenance is all about nearly 10 to 20% after the product development by software Development Company."
