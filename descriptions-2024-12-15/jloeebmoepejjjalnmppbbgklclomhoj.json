Every time you open a new window or tab in Chrome, the Onward! page appears, listing the tasks you need to complete for the day.  If you finish a task, click on the corresponding button and it will go away.  If you complete them all, then Onward! no longer blocks you when you attempt to visit the sites found on your Blocked Sites list.\n\nThe next day (specifically, right after midnight), when you next open a window or tab, the tasks will reappear.  They are *daily* tasks, after all. If you want to get rid of a task forever (I mean, like, if you really want to stop feeding the cat, ok) then hover over the task and you will see a little link titled \"Delete Permanently\""
