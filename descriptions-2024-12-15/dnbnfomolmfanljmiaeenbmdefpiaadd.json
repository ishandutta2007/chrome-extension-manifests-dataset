You might want to save your progress so that when you revisit same page you may want to quickly jump where you left. This extension will make it possible :D.\n\nThis extension will help user to select any text on a web page and save it as a bookmark, so that when user is revisiting the same web page he/she will be able to see all the saved bookmark on right side of the page in a transparent bar, which will appear only on hover. User will have ability to delete the existing bookmarks and quickly jump to specific bookmark. These bookmarks are getting saved in user's browser only. so for every unique URL there will be unique bookmark data.\n\nThis extension is not sending any info outside the user's system. Everything is client side only. so all the user data is safe."
