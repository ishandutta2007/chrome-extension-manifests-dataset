Chromeduino features an IDE environment to edit your Arduino sketch, AVRChick to upload your sketches to your Arduino, and a new serial terminal mode that lets you interact with your Arduino. No longer do you need to find a Mac or Windows PC to use your Arduino.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Full featured IDE text editor\n- Load and Save sketches right off your computer\n- Interactive terminal mode\n- Uploads sketches directly over USB to your Arduino\n- No special accounts, access, service fees, etc.\n- Works great on Chromebook, chromebox, or any computer with a chrome browser!\n\nComing soon in next release:\n\n- Library support\n- Multi-tab support for includes\n- Selectable serial rate and character entry modes\n- Examples library\n- Better control character support in terminal mode\n- Better sketch error reporting\n\n\nNote: Although Chromeduino was written as an offline application, it does interact with a cloud web service to compile your sketch to a hex file. This service is completely free and transparent, but you must have internet connectivity to compile your sketches. This will change soon once AVR-GCC is ported to JavaScript. If you need an offline method of programming hex files to an Arduino, check out my other application \"AVRChick\".\n\n(Developed on a Chromebook for ChromeOS using PureSolid)"
