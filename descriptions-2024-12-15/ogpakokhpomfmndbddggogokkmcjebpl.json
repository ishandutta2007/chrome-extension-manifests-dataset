Just open the website you want to inspect, click the icon in the browser bar and a popup shows up.\n\nThe popup will show performance data like: DNS Lookup Time, Network Connection Time, Time to First Byte, Document Ready and Document Complete. It also shows some performance information in terms of the DOM, such as number of external files (Javascript, CSS) or number of DOM elements. And finally there is a panel for memory usage of Javascript execution.\n\nThis extension will give you the possibility to get a quick overview of the performance of a website and to compare it with other sites.\n\nFeedback is very welcome! If you have some feedback or ideas for additional information to show in the popup, don't hesitate to contact me."
