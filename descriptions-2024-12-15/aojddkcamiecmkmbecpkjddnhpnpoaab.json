Thus, if your camera supports that 16:9 HD aspect ratio, a proper non-squished feed will be returned to the web client. If your camera only supports 4:3 aspect ratio, such as 1024x768 or 640x480, then the request should nicely downgrade for your camera and still provide non-squished (albeit not-HD aspect ratio) video for your calls.\n\nBy default, the settings for this extension only apply the patch to Zoom/WhereBy/Google-Meet sites. You can change the settings to apply to different sites. There's also a handy enable/disable toggle switch if you want to quickly turn off the extension temporarily without actually uninstalling it."
