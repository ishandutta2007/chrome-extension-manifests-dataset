Your goal is to trap the cat by blocking its path with dark circles. The cat will try to escape by moving to one of the neighboring cells. The game ends when the cat is surrounded by dark circles or when it escapes.\n\nThe game is played on a hexagonal board. The cat starts in the center of the board and you can place dark circles on any of the empty cells. The cat can move to any of the neighboring cells that are not blocked by a dark circle.\n\nYou win the game if you can surround the cat with dark circles. If the cat escapes, you will lose and have to start over.\n\nHere are some tips for playing Catch the Cat:\n\nTry to block the cat's escape routes early on.\nBe careful not to surround yourself with dark circles.\nUse your dark circles strategically to trap the cat.\nPractice makes perfect!
