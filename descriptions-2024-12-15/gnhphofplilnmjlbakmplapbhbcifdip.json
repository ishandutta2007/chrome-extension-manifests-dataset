Do you often click links to other streaming services and then have to search for the album on your own service?\n\nIf so, Music Link can automate this process for you! Simply click the link to the other service, and Music Link will try to find this content on your preferred service, and automatically redirect you if it's found!\n\nAfter installing the extension, just click on it's icon to configure your preferences, and then you can forget about it and let it work it's magic! Many popular music streaming services are supported.\n\nThis extension is powered by Songlink/Odesli, but is not affiliated with it.\nhttps://odesli.co/\n\nThe extension's source code is available here: https://github.com/leddt/music-link"
