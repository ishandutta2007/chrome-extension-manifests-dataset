By guiding your reading, your eyes are forced into moving in the direction of the pacer.  In other words, pacer speed reading forces your eyes to focus when and where you want them to focus.

Since pacer speed reading involves using other parts of the body, it’s easier to stay alert while reading and that helps improve concentration, too.\n\nFingers, hands, plastic rulers and cards aren’t very effective when trying to speed read on screen.  That's why pacer speed reading is created to help.\n\nJust simply click START button then click on any text you want to read, a highlighting pacer will appear and move with a speed you want. It stops when reaching the end of a paragraph. Click on the next paragraph to continue.\n\nThe pacer speed, its color and movement are customizable in the browser action popup. Show popup by clicking on pacer speed reading icon on browser toolbar.\n\nPacer speed reading doesn't require any special permission. It's open-sourced."
