This column displays player's rank within different rating groups\n\nTie-breaking is performed as per USCF recommended order\n\n# Modified Median (TBrkM column)\n# Solkoff (TBrkS column)\n# Cumulative (TBrkC column)\n# Cumulative opponent's score (TBrkO column)\n\nMODIFIED MEDIAN (TBrkM)\n\nFor each player, this system sums the number of points earned by the player's opponents, but  \n* discards the highest and lowest opponent's scores if player earned exactly 50% score;\n* discards the lowest opponent's scores if player earned more than 50% score;\n* discards the highest opponent's scores if player earned less than 50% score.\n\nSOLKOFF (TBrkS)\n\nThis system is the same as the Median system, except that no scores are discarded.\n\nCUMULATIVE (TBrkC)\n\nTo calculate this, sum the running score for each round. For example, if a player has (in order) a win, loss, win, draw, and a loss; his round-by-round score will be 1, 1, 2, 2½, 2½. The sum of these numbers is 9. \n\nCUMULATIVE OPPONENT'S SCORE (TBrkC)\n\nThis sums the cumulative scores of the player's opponents.\n\nSee more details on Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-breaking_in_Swiss-system_tournaments\n\nTOURNAMENTS LISTS ENHANCEMENTS\n\n1) Adds number of sections and number of players to \"Event ID\" column\n\n2) Adds section details (number of rounds, number of players etc) to \"Event Name\" column\n\n3) Changes underlying link of event name so it points directly to section (not to tournament page as before)"
