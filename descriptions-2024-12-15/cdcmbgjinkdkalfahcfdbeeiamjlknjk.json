As Elon Musk recently mentioned:\n\n\"The ùïè algorithm assumes that if you interact with content, you want to see more of that content [...]\"\n\nThis leads to a problem where users engage with highly clickable content, but not necessarily content they want to keep seeing in their feed. The result is often a polarizing and less enjoyable feed experience.\n\nThe Problem with X's Interest Settings\n\nX uses user interests for various purposes, including feed curation and ad targeting. These interests play a crucial role in the feed algorithm, as detailed in X's algorithm documentation.\n\nWhile users can manually update their interests at X's interest settings page, there are a few problems:\n\n1. This setting is a bit hidden and most users don't know it exist\n2. Time-consuming to uncheck interests manually\n3. It's subject to rate limits, requiring users to wait between removing interests\n\nX likely makes this process complicated to discourage users from altering these settings, as they seem important for ad targeting.\n\nHow Neuralyzer Works\n\nThis Chrome extension automates the process of removing all your user interests, saving you time and effort, and letting you experience a cleaner, more relevant X feed.\n\nUsage\n\n1. Click on the Neuralyzer icon in your Chrome toolbar\n2. If you're not on the X interests page, click \"Go to Interests\"\n3. Select any interests you want to keep\n4. Click \"Remove interests\" to start the process"
