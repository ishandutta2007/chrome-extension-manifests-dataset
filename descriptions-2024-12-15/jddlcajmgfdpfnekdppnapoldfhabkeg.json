Too much bulky chrome, borders, margins and paddings. Wouldn't you sometimes wish you could just chip away all the unnecessary junk?\n\n- How?\nThis small Chrome Extension adds an extra button to the Trello toolbar. Click it and you get more than *50% more actual content on your screen*. Yes, 50 fucking percent.\n\nOpen source on Github:\nhttps://github.com/laander/trello-birdseye\n\n---------------------------\n\nv1.2.2 (2019-01-14)\n\n- Hides the card cover images that usually takes up a lot of space on board\n- Fixed some hover icon colors from dark gray to white\n\nv1.2.1 (2019-01-12)\n\n- Avatars on cards were not resized properly\n- \"6 cards\" subtitle under each list header should be white\n- \"...\" three dots submenu in list header should be white\n- Little \"+\" icon in \"Add another card\" under list footer should be white\n\nv1.2.0 (2018-01-09)\n\n- Persistent button state using chrome storage (requires new \"storage\" permission)\n- Initializes immediately when page is opened\n- Increased check interval to 3 seconds\n- Fixed the min-width on labels following the latest Trello update\n\nv1.1.0 (2017-06-12)\n\n- Made default click behaviour open the card instead of the inline-edit shortcut menu\n- Show card member icons!\n- Increased size of labels a bit and re-aligned them\n- Decreased check time to 1s (a bit faster to show on the page)\n\nv1.0.0 (2015-12-03)\n\nFirst release!"
