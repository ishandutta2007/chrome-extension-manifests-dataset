You simply need to install the extension. And start adding whatever you like on the internet. This project I created for my personal use but later I realise it can be used by anyone. So here it is available for everyone.\n\nWhy Outline?\n1. Privacy focused. The data can only read by you only. Its between you and your browser. Code is open sourced. So you can always look whats going. No one can recover your info. If it's gone, it's gone\n2. Rich text formatting allowed. You can highlight according to your convenience.\n3. Less clutter info: Not everything you read should be in your notes. Sometimes you just need some pointer which you can review later. You can think outline as quick draft which you can save  all your info anywhere you want\n4. Easy to find whatever you type\n\nNote: This extension rely chrome storage api. So it has its own limitation. If you do not need any specific notes, delete it. So that it does not give your storage warning. More you can read here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#property-local\n\nAnd much more feature will come soon...\n\nIf you want new feature request or found any bug. Feel free to open ticket here: https://github.com/shubhamV123/outline"
