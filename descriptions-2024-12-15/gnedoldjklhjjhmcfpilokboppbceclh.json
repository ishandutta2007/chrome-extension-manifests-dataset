This is the only reason for the active tab permission. No other info about your tab is captured or recorded.\n* Our code is open-source. You can always check it at https://github.com/owlracle/extension, or ask us anything on our Discord server at https://owlracle.info/discord-general\n\n🛠️ Patch Notes \n\n🔹Version 1.3\n\n🔸Added automatic support for all chains supported on the website.\n🔸Changed visua style for dropdown menus.\n🔸Now gas section shows maxFee, priorityFee and baseFee for eip1559 networks.\n🔸Added Customize Fee feature, allowing to pick common transactions to show you accurate fees in USD.\n🔸Added Customize Speeds feature, allowing to pick custom accept value for each of the four gas cards.\n\n🔹Version 1.2.0.3\n\n🔸Tx advisor fee is set to FREE until further notice.\n🔸Removed cookies permission.\n🔸Added a permission and privacy policies information.\n\n🔹Version 1.2\n\n🔸Added a new tab for tx advisor: a new feature enabling Owlracle Extension to override the gas price settings set by protocols right into your Metamaks interface."
