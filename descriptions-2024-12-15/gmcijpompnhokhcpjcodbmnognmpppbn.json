This allows you to make your cheating efforts a bit more mobile by being able to pull up our anagram solver at will. \n\nTo use our extension, just click the extension icon and it will bring up a window. Just type your tile rack letters into the \"letters\" field and click \"Go!\". We'll then take those letters and tell you what words you can play with them, how long each word is, and how many points each word is worth. These answers can help you make more noteworthy moves on your turns.\n\nThe anagram solver also offers some advanced options that are completely optional to use. They can be particularly helpful when placing words on a board that already has letters. If you're trying to connect to a tile already on the board, you can enter it as a \"Begins With\" letter to show words that will start with that letter. The same can be done with the \"Ends With\" field if you want to end on that letter. The last option is to put that letter in the \"Contains\" field to show you words where that letter is present in the middle of the word. You can even use a combination of all three fields if you're trying to play in a particularly tight spot.\n\nOnce you have your list of answers from the solver, you can click directly on the word to be directed to a page that will tell you the definition of the word. The second thing you can do is click \"See on Board Solver\" to direct you to our website that has a full-fledged board solver to track your plays in the most convenient way possible that not only lists words you can play, but even shows you where to play them!"
