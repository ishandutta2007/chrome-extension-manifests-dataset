Hover on it to read and post comments.\n\n*Time-specific comments: comments are linked to where in the show's timeline they were posted. If you posted a comment at minute 3, it will only be visible to other people after they reach minute 3.\n\n*Spoiler protection: spoilers are automatically blurred out until they're safe to read. Thanks to our reporting system, comments that violate our Code of Conduct are quickly taken down.\n\n*No need to sign-up: a unique name is automatically assigned to you when you first watch a show on Netflix with the extension installed. You can start commenting right away.\n\n*Join the discussion: see where the latest comments where posted from the Trending tab and join fellow commenters."
