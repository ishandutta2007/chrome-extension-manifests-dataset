Quickly record your face, voice or your screen and allow discussions to come to life through recorded video. Students and teachers can respond to each other in organized groups of conversations that classes can watch, re-watch, pause and rewind individually.  \n\nThoughts and ideas can now go far beyond the classroom as conversations can happen any time, any place. That's right, no real-time meeting required! Gravity creates access equity for students to have powerful educational tools wherever they are. What's more, it provides an inclusive environment that creates the time and space needed for students of all backgrounds to participate in learning."
