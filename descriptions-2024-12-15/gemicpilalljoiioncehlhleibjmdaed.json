Fans deserve to be able to give that support quickly and easily.\n\nSet up the Centiments extension just once, then support any creator with just two clicks whenever you are on their pages!\n\nMORE INFORMATION:\n\nThe internet is amazing\n\nThere is so much brilliant content published online. But, all too often you can’t access it, and publishers aren’t getting paid fair amounts for their hard work. \n\nCentiments’ mission is to fix these problems and make online publishing work for everyone. \n\nWhen you browse, you often find the best content is locked up behind paywalls that need expensive monthly subscriptions. Or you have to deal with armies of adverts getting in your way.   \n\nAt the same time, content publishers are struggling to get paid fair amounts for their hard work. Big platforms take the majority of advertising revenue and expensive subscriptions mean that we cannot support all of the different creators we would like to.\n\nBy downloading our browser extension, you get to choose which content and creators you support in just a few clicks, paying small amounts directly to the creators of the content you want to see.\n\nCreators get paid properly for their wonderful work and you are able to access what you want, when you want.\n\nJoin us in making the internet better!"
