As you browse products, Hotaudeals seamlessly integrates a price history panel directly into the webpage, allowing you to see how prices have fluctuated over time. Make smarter purchasing decisions with transparent pricing insights, all without leaving the page.\n\nStarting in early September 2024, we're launching a powerful cashback rate comparison tool, built right into HotAuDeals Help. With this feature, you'll be able to compare the cashback rates from ShopBack, Cashrewards, and TopCashback directly on the merchant page, giving you more insight into ongoing promotions without the need to navigate away."
