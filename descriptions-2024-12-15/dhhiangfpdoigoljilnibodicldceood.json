Once the employee comes to work, he/she should clock in, so the manager can see that he/she is in the office. The same situation happens when the employee is going out of office. (she/he should clock out).\nBased on this clock ins/clocks out the application generates various reports for managers. \nCurrently clock in/clock out is done within 4-5 steps:\n* user needs to login to the application\n* user needs to go specific page\n* user needs to filter grid to choose current date row\n* user needs to clock in\n* user needs to save\n\nThat is why we came up with chrome extension, it makes life of employees easier. We hope, we have achieved this goal."
