Do you book Tatkal often? Have you got any mis-booking experience with IRCTC like you want to book from Place-A to Place-B and booked the ticket for vice-versa? It happens everywhere and to everyone when we are in hurry for booking the ticket, especially on the Tatkal bookings. \n\nSo do I and it happened thrice in my transaction history. So created an extension that verifies the day of the travel with the Destinations and alert you if you have chosen the wrong.\n\nEg.\nLet say your home is in Chennai (MAS) and you work at Bangalore (SBC). So you would be travelling often to and from often on the destinations. \n\nAlso, the more probability that you will be travelling from Chennai to Bangalore (MAS > SBC) will be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday(in case of occasions). The destination changes when it is on other days. So you could say the extension that your preferred destination as\n\nSBC to MAS > Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday\nMAS to SBC > Sunday, Monday, Tuesday\n\nSo while you are booking ticket in IRCTC portal and when you select SBC to MAS for the day Sunday it will give you an alert that you have chosen the wrong option of Destinations."
