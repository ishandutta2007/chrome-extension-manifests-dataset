It adds in email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.  It's really simple and really useful (especially for Google Voice users).\n\nWorks pretty well but there are a few bugs left to fix:\n * occasionally doesn't load the extra contact info\n * doesn't look good when the contact has an employer\n\nIf there are any more bugs or suggestions, please let me know!"
