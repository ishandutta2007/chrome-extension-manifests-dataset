If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron.”\n\nTwitter states the blue Verified badge on their platform lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic. Prior to the Elon era of Twitter, to receive the blue badge, your account must be \"authentic, notable, and active\".\n\nCertain accounts are ineligible for the blue badge, regardless of satisfying the above requirements including: Parody, newsfeed, commentary, unofficial fan accounts, pets, fictional characters, and many more.\n\nJust days after becoming the newly minted CEO of Twitter, Elon floated changes to Twitter’s system for verifying user accounts, including charging $8 per month for the privilege (via Twitter Blue). What wasn't clear was whether currently verified Twitter users will lose their blue checkmark if they don’t pay $7.99 per month. This upset many folks.\n\nAnd some of the loudest backlash came from a group that arguably gripes about Twitter the most while using it avidly: journalists and other media personalities, many of whom say they are not inclined to pay.\n\nEnter 'Quitter Blue'! If you or anyone decides to give up their verified badges rather than pay - no problem! Simply enable Quitter Blue through Google Chrome and everyone on Twitter magically becomes verified: Bots, your grandma, pets, fictional characters, and many more!"
