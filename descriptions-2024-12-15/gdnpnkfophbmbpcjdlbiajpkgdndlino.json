It's also compatible with the AutoPagerize Database, which means it supports thousands of websites automatically. Infy supports 4 different actions and 6 different append modes so you can customize each site's infinite scrolling to how you want it to be. Infy understands both CSS Selector and XPath expressions for finding next links, and it features an Element Picker that can generate them for you, similar to the original AutoPager. It can also increment URLs and perform special actions, like clicking \"Load More\" buttons. You can save your settings for each URL and Infy will auto-activate the next time you visit them.\n\nI want you to be 100% happy with Infy\nIf something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub and give me a chance to fix it and I promise I will.
