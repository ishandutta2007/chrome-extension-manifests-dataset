It uses AI to parse information from your SafeBase Trust Center,  Knowledge Base content, external websites, and security artifacts, including Word/docx and PDF files, generating high-confidence, highly accurate answers that need little to no human input.\n\nWhen a buyer requests a questionnaire through a vendor risk management portal, the SafeBase Chrome extension enables questionnaire response directly within that portal. It automatically detects portal-based questions, finds or generates responses, and populates answers. SafeBase supports major portals like OneTrust, Google Forms, Whistic, Microsoft forms, ProcessUnity, Panorays, and more.\n\nHow AI Questionnaire Assistance Works:\n• Import questionnaires to SafeBase\nImport your security questionnaire from the portal into SafeBase and sync the questionnaire to your Trust Center and Knowledge Base. \n\n• Search for similar responses\nUsing AI, SafeBase searches through your Trust Center content and Knowledge Base to find previously-generated responses that match or are similar to current questions. \n\n• AI generates new responses\nIf no matching response is found, AI Questionnaire Assistance generates a new, accurate answer, citing source information for every response. \n\n• Review and approval\nReview generated responses, make any necessary edits or assign question owners, and approve them for use. \nExport and respond in portals: Once responses are approved, export them directly back to the portal via SafeBase's Chrome extension. \n\nDon’t have AI Questionnaire Assistance yet? For existing SafeBase customers, our Chrome Extension also enables all team members to easily search your Knowledge Base or Trust Center for previously-asked buyer questions directly within their flow of work.\n\nAbout SafeBase\n\n‍SafeBase is the leading Trust Center Platform designed for friction-free security reviews. With an enterprise-grade Trust Center, SafeBase automates the security review process and transforms how companies communicate their security and trust posture.\nIf you want to see how fast-growing companies like LinkedIn, Asana, and Jamf take back the time their teams spend on security questionnaires, create better buying experiences, and position security as the revenue-driver it is, schedule a demo."
