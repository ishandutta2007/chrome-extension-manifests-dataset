You will be able to use the backslash key to initiate taking measurements. When finished, click the \"Stop Measuring\" button. While taking measurements in Zoom, you will be unable to interact with other buttons in the video call until the Stop Measuring button is clicked. There is a quick demo video on my YouTube channel for this.\n\nClick to mark the points of your stationary goniometer arm, the axis of rotation, and the measuring arm.\n\nAs you are measuring there will be a live display of the current angle, with the supplementary angle in brackets.\n\nFind all measured angles recorded in the left side panel, and easily copy all values with the copy button.\n\nTo hide the \"Recorded Angles\" tab in the top left corner of the page, press the \"`\" (backquote or backtick) key which is next to the number 1 on the keyboard.\n\nThis extension should work on any video conferencing platform that uses Chrome. So far, it has been tested on Zoom, MS Teams, OTN, Adracare, and Doxy. If there are other platforms that do not currently work and you would like to have it supported, please send me an email and I will get back to you when possible.\n\nTo use the goniometer on photos from your computer, use the following instructions:\n- Right click the extension icon in the top right of your browser > click manage extensions > click allow access to file URLs\n- Drag and drop the image into the Chrome browser\n\nYou should now be able to use the extension on local images."
