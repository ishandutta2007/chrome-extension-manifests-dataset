Free trials are typically limited by time, such as a 7-day or 30-day free trial.\nFree trial extensions are often offered by companies that want to give users more time to evaluate their product or service before deciding to purchase a subscription. They can also be used to encourage users who have already signed up for a free trial to convert into paying customers.\nTo request a free trial extension, users typically need to contact the company's customer support team. The company may then ask the user to provide some information about their experience with the product or service, and why they need more time to evaluate it.\nIf the company approves the request, the user will be given an additional period of time to use the product or service for free. The length of the extension will vary depending on the company's policy."
