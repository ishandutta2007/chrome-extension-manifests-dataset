When you just need to know how many eggs, but don't want to read about the divorce.\n\nThis extension finds the actual recipe on many* popular recipe blogs, and brings it to the top of the page - no more scrolling to the bottom to get what you came for.\n\nThink the author's blog post should take precedence over the recipe? Don't install this extension.\n\nSUPPORT:\nRecipe isn't above the blog as promised? Something else went wrong? Contact the support email below and we'll fix it ASAP\n\n* Please note: We are working on getting as many to work as possible, but some sites can't be affected for technical reasons. Let us know and we'll do our best!"
