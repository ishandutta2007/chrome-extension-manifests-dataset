This makes it difficult to download your audio as you cannot just inspect the page and look for an .mp3 or .mp4 file to download. \n\nThis extension works by monitoring network activity in the browser when activated, and searching for a m3u8 URL which is a playlist that tells the server which files to play and in what order. \n\nOnce the extension finds the m3u8 URL, it assembles all of the files and combines them for download.\n\nPRIVACY\n\nThere is no backend to this extension which means none of your activity passes through a centralized server. This also means we can not track your usage or see what you download. \n\nWe do not store your sessions or even know what you are doing with the extension. No one does except you and Chrome of course.\n\nThe extension does need certain permissions in the browser to work properly, but be sure that we are not monitoring your web usage, or tracking any of your online behavior. This is one of the reasons I have open sourced the code so that people can know exactly what the extension is doing or even run it locally if you prefer.\n\nhttps://github.com/Raymmar/media-downloader\n\nROADMAP\n\n- Right now the extension only downloads audio + video files from Twitter spaces. However it could easily be modified to grab media from other platforms.\n- I am thinking about adding the ability to download videos from twitter as well as YouTube.\n- I am also thinking about adding the ability to download YouTube thumbnails with the extension as I often find myself using external services for this as well.\n- Maybe this thing could connect to an LLM and spit out a transcript of the media as well?\n- I have many other ideas, but who knows what I will add.\n\nYou are welcome to fork the repo and use my code as your starting point. If you are interested in helping me improve the extension or have ideas for new features, feel free to reach out or leave a comment on GitHub."
