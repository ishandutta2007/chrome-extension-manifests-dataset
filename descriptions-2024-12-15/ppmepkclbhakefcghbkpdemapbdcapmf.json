The Reddit Political Post Blocker (RPPB) is here to help! This extension filters out political posts, allowing you to enjoy a politics-free browsing experience on Reddit.\n\nWith comprehensive keyword filtering, RPPB automatically blocks posts containing political keywords to keep your feed clean.

If you choose to view a blocked post, the \"Open Post\" button makes it easy. Experience Reddit the way you wantâ€”free from unwanted political content.\n\nPlease note that due to the limitations of filtering by keywords, some posts may still not be filtered, and the addon cannot detect context in images.\n\n1.1 Update\n-Added Popup Settings Window: Easily toggle the extension on or off.\n-Updated Keywords: Refined list to include recent political terms.\n-Added the ability for users to submit suggestions for additional keywords to filter."
