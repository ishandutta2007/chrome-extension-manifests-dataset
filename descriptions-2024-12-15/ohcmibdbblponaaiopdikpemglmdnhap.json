This Chrome Extension works on Amazon Seller Center Manage Orders. It reads the page and sends product SKU's to Analision Database and then it makes DOM manipulation on the Amazon's Seller page to show more detail about those products, such as total sale, total sold unit, and total order for the last 90, 60, and 30 days. To have this functionality, this extension uses storage, and looks for tab and URL changes. It only works on https://sellercentral.amazon.com/orders-v3* which is the URL Amazon uses to display the order details. \n\n➤Features:\n-Makes DOM manipulation on Amazon Seller page in order to display information about products sold by the Amazon Seller.\n-Tells the user (the Amazon seller) how many orders that item has received in the last 90, 60, and 30 days by getting data from Analision's Database. \n-Tells the user (the Amazon seller) how many units has been sold for that products  in the last 90, 60, and 30 days by getting data from Analision's Database. \n-Tells the user (the Amazon seller) how much money has been made out of that product  in the last 90, 60, and 30 days by getting data from Analision's Database. \n-Remember user when logged in."
