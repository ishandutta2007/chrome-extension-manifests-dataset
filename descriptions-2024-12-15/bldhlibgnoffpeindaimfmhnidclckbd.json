You can search by keyword or Unicode codepoint.\n\nOnce you have found the character or emoji that you need, you can now easily copy the character to the clipboard for use in another program or webpage.\n\nIf you need to get more information on any of the selected characters, you can just click on the 'More Info' button which will redirect you to the characters webpage, on the page you will find extra information for the selected character or emoji.\n\nAll characters and emojis are available up to Unicode version 16.0\n\nIf you search for a character that displays a black rectangle, that means you do not have any font files that support that character. Head on over to https://www.charactercodes.net/font-support/ to test your fonts for character support.\nLikewise, if an emoji does not show, it may mean that it has just been released and your operating system does not support it yet."
