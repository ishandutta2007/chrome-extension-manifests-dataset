The image either comes from our own database of images, that correspond to the real foods that were once cooked, or they come from google images.\nThere is also support for star food rating (If you want to publish your rating, you need to login using your google account) (Check learn section inside extension if you're the Brave browser user)\nAnd there is support for Dark / Light mode.\n\nThe whole project has a public repo at: github.com/Xopabyteh/Seminary_PrimirestPlus_Gen2"
