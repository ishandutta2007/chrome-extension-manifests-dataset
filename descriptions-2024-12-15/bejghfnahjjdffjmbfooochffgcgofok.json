It empowers users to verify select private information they encounter in the browser to relevant third parties. Its primary function involves accessing your confidential credentials, like API keys, and securely encrypting them on your frontend. These encrypted credentials are then sent to Clique's identity oracles for data access.\n\nLeveraging the capabilities of TEE, ZKP, and MPC, the entire process remains stringently privacy-centric from start to finish. This ensures that neither Clique nor any other entity can pry into your private credentials, data, or any associated information. Your data remains under your control, disclosed only based on your set preferences. In specific scenarios, the extension syncs with the Clique Attestor to log particular data statements on-chain. For instance, a statement might be: \"This user has more than x followers on Twitter.\""
