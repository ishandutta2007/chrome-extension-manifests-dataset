Verify that the content was written by a human and not an AI chatbot. \n\nDetect AI content while you're browsing. Use this AI Content Detector to select or highlight any text on the internet, and quickly check if it was generated by AI.\n\nOur AI Detection extension will also generate certificates that you can use to share your results, or as proof that your work was not AI generated.\n\nCheck your writing to detect AI content, verify that AI detectors will classify your writing as human-written.\n\nRun AI detection on LinkedIn posts. Use the AI content detector to see if LinkedIn content was AI-generated.\n\nRun AI detection on Reddit posts and comments. Use the AI content detector to see if Reddit content was AI-generated.\n\nRun AI detection on Facebook posts. Use the AI content detector to see if Facebook posts were AI generated.\n\nThe extension works as a ChatGPT checker - Check ChatGPT outputs easily to see if they would be flagged as having been written by AI.\n\nWe analyze the overall text, but also detect and highlight sections and sentences that look like they were content written by an AI chatbot.\n\nGet confidence scores on every analysis, representing how confident we are in our AI content detection.\n\n== How you can use this extension ==\n• On popular generative AI sites, like ChatGPT (chatgpt.com) and Claude (claude.ai) we automatically embed a \"Detect AI\" button next to every response.\n• Anywhere on the internet, from social media and news sites, to anywhere you're typing out your content, simply select the text you want to check and click on our button to analyze it.\n• Once you've run a text for analysis, you can edit it inline to and re-submit it till you've removed any suspicious pieces of text!\n\n== Why is this important today?\n\nAI generated content is proliferating across the internet. Services like ChatGPT, Bard, Claude make it easier than ever before to write long articles, LinkedIn posts, or other piece of published text - including homework assignments and work reports. \n\nCompanies, content platforms, schools, universities are becoming more and more sensitive to content that is purely AI generated, and may use tools, similar to ours, to penalize or block such content.\n\nThis technology also makes it easier for bad actors to rapidly generate misleading or disingenous content. We hope our extension can help users quickly detect such work.\n\n== What does it cost?\n\nThis AI Content Detector is built by Sapling.ai (https://sapling.ai/). We offer a free trial for one month, with all functionality provided. After that, AI detection is a premium-only feature.
