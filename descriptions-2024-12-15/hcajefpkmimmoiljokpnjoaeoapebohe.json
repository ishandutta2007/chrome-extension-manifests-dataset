These devices track and record various activity data  (heart rate, power, location, speed etc.) of the athlete.\n\nThe recorded user data is accessible for Garmin users either from their physical device interface or via web interface (Garmin Connect Web - https://connect.garmin.com/) or mobile app.\n\nFor some of the Garmin users, a special part of the data (LoadFocus) is NOT showing up in Garmin Connect Web (this is a bug), even though they are able to see LoadFocus in their device screen.\n\nThis is a well known issue for more than 2 years but unfortunately this has not been fixed by Garmin.\n\nPlease see related topics:\n\nhttps://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mobile-apps-web/f/garmin-connect-web/169713/load-focus-missing-for-edge-530\n\nhttps://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mobile-apps-web/f/garmin-connect-mobile-andriod/217163/training-load-focus-shows-on-edge-530-but-not-on-connect-mobile-or-website/\n\nSo this is where the extension comes into play. It simply looks for a special XHR request and slightly modify (changes a JSON setting from false to true) the response.\n\nThis will be useful for all Garmin users who wants to see their training load from Garmin Connect Web interface."
