This means that it is resilient to attacks and that you are the only one who can access your passwords.\n\nSecurity experts recommend that you use a different, randomly generated password for every account that you create, and Vault makes this easy. Vault can generate passwords and store them for you, this means that you only need to remember one password, your passcode.\n\nLooking to store and swiftly retrieve your data? Vaults facilitate searchable items, allowing you to effortlessly copy the desired information with a single click.\n\nVault is free, open source, and decentralized; and will always be."
