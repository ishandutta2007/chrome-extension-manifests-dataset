Most certificates are made available online by control bodies such as Ecocert. However, looking up every business partner on a regular basis can be very time-consuming task.\n\nThis free extension helps you maintain your list of Ecocert-certified business partners / operators, directly on the Ecocert website at http://certificat.ecocert.com.\n\n➤ Save your organic food operators in a 'favorites' list,\n➤ Get all your favorite operators' data displayed on the Ecocert Certificates main page (certificat.ecocert.com) -- see screenshots,\n➤ Update all your records periodically with a single click (sync limited to once an hour for each operator). \n➤ Download your operators' data as '.csv' file to import into MS Excel / Google Sheets for further treatment. \n➤ Data is saved locally in your Chrome browser, not shared with anyone.\n\n\nNote: This extension is independent from Ecocert Group.\n\n_____________________________________________________\nKnown bugs - To be fixed in future releases:\n\n1. Where operators have more than one type of certification in place, for example \"EU Bio\" and \"Gluten-free\", the extension will only consider the first certification type appearing on the Ecocert page.\n2. A few operators have an Ecocert page, but no certificates available. Such operators can be added to your favorites list, but will be missing from the \".csv\" downloads."
