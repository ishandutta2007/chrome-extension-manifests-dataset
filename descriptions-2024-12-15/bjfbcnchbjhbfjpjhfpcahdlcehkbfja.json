That's because, I'm that way too.\n\nWhen I research a product, I want to make sure I'm getting the best value for my money. That can't be done without looking at all the pages that are hidden behind lists, only accessible until now by clicking, waiting, sifting through useless screens, and calculating shipping cost and cost per item.\n\nBypass all the sponsored ads to get to the thing that you want most!"
