If you are running the default Release build of Chrome, this extension will not successfully install until late January 2012.\n\nDo Not Track is a technology and policy proposal that enables users to opt out of tracking by websites they do not visit, including analytics services, advertising networks, and social platforms. At present few of these third parties offer a reliable tracking opt out, and tools for blocking them are neither user-friendly nor comprehensive. Much like the popular Do Not Call registry, Do Not Track provides users with a single, simple, persistent choice to opt out of third-party web tracking. A list of websites that have committed to honoring Do Not Track is available at http://donottrack.us. The source for this extension is available on GitHub."
