The user cannot access the site until they have completed all questions. Once the questions are finished, the site can only be used for a previously specified amount of time before another set of questions appears.\n\nThe user defines a list of websites, and specifies when the block is \"on\".\n\nThe user also defines how difficult each question is, and how many questions are asked before the user can go to the website.\n\nIf this extension has been helpful to you, please consider sending me a donation through my in-app PayPal link. Thank you.\n\nIcons made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com is licensed by CC 3.0 BY"
