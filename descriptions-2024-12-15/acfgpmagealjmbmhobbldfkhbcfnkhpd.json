Although this published version should be bug-free, there may still be a few issues that persist. As well, there are a few features that have been requested, some of which will be added before the official 1.0 release.\n\n========================\n\nEarthTab pulls images from Reddit's SFW nature porn to transform your new tabs into beautiful windows into Earth's natural beauty.\n\nReddit has a treasure trove of beautiful images of Earth, submitted tirelessly around the clock. EarthTab uses these images as backgrounds for your new tabs, offering you a pleasant look at images the Reddit community has declared spectacular.\n\nYou can set which specific nature subreddits you would like to pull images from, as well as the frequency that new images are looked for.\n\n========================\nRELEASE NOTES:\n\n- v0.2.0 (Beta): now pulls images from different domains (not just i.imgur) (May 20th/2015)\n- v0.3.0 (Beta): images no longer show up more than once (June 4th/2015)\n- v0.4.0 (Beta): no more frequency slider; Dark theme options; bug fixes/stability improvements (June 10th/2015)\n\n========================\n\nThis is an open-source project, the source for which is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/himynameisdave/EarthTab\n\nBuilt by Dave Lunny in the beautiful year 2015. http://himynameisdave.com\n\nLicensed under the MIT licence."
