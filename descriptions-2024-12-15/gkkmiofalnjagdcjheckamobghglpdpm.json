Most keys should work if they are not reserved.\n\nWhile in fullscreen mode, mouse over where the search bar usually is for it to appear; it will also appear while scrolling.\n\nWe're Moving to a Freemium Model, and why:\nI never thought I would have to make this decision, and I want to apologize for the change. Unfortunately, with the current economic situation and after recently losing my job, I need a source of income to keep this extension running and up-to-date. Maintaining the extension, especially with the frequent changes to YouTube's layout, requires significant time and effort. By introducing a premium model, I'll be able to dedicate the necessary time to continue updating and improving the extension.\n\nI understand that this may not be ideal for many of you, but I hope you'll understand the circumstances. Thank you for your continued support, and I'm truly grateful for all the users who have used the extension over the years.\n\nSign up won't take any credit card or anything like that; Subscriptions are set at $5 AUD per year and you can immediately set it to not be recurring afterwards through either this link here https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/bIYaEUf1Ze6m79mcMM or clicking the 'Manage Subscription' button after payment has been made. \n\nLink to the terms of use and privacy policy: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1czbBOblR46ucyfxpCUhdNnxh_TUH69R2Up-KbA6-ffw/pub\n\nI have removed some images from the extension which have reduced the extension size again. The Chrome Web Store is still processing my change to a trader account and will be reflected as soon as it's done."
