On most pages on the internet, animated gifs are the perfect supplement to the material they are paired with. Writers will add these moving pictures to illustrate emotion, showcase a product feature, or add comic relief. And they are everywhere. But most of the time, I hate them.\n\nWhen you are busy concentrating on the material at hand, moving pictures, especially ones not in your direct focus, are super distracting.\n\nKitty Replace sets to suppress these unwanted peripheral vision hi-jackers. Simply hit the icon and all animated GIFs will be replaced with adorable kittens.\n\n------------\nFAQs\n\n*I changed my mind. How do I see the animated gifs again?\n\nToggling doesn't currently work right now (maybe later). For now, just refresh your page!\n\n*Does this help with load times? Those gifs are so dang slow.\n\nNot at all. This extension only works after all resources have been loaded onto a page.\n\n------------\nTechnical Information\n\nThere's not much going on here. The extension makes use of Mark James' PlaceKitten (https://placekitten.com/) It uses a quick javascript inspection of the DOM for any files with the .gif extension. It then asks what the height and width of are of that image. Lastly it uses this metadata to make a request for the perfectly sized kitten image.
