Where to store this information safely? Secure Bookmarks allows you to store such bookmarks in a separate list, safely encrypted on your hard drive. After opening your browser, simply click the Secure Bookmarks icon and enter your password to retrieve your bookmarks! All decrypted information is lost the second you close your browser.\n\nSecure Bookmarks includes a ten second set-up page and a clean and intuitive interface, allowing you to create, edit, and rearrange bookmarks easily. Use folders to organize your bookmarks. Plus, you can exchange bookmarks between Chrome and Secure Bookmarks effortlessly from the Settings page.\n\nYou can export your data to an encrypted text file, which can be used to restore information or share between computers.\n\nBe sure to request extra features or improvements. Also, please take the effort to leave a rating if you appreciate my hard work!\n\nNew in version 1.4.4: \n- Added always-open-incognito option\n- Added 'Add to Secure Bookmarks' context menu item\n- Performance improvements and minor bug fixes"
