This current release assists in saving some simple data still provided by 23andMe.\n\nStores your 23andMe DNA Matches in a local database. Allows you to export to other analysis software such as GDAT and Gephi. It also lists shared segments and has a graphical display of overlapping segments shared and not shared between two people.\n\nThis is a reworking of the \"529 and You\" extension that is no longer available. This extension has a different database layout, but it can import csv files that were exported from 529 and You (provided that they included the unique ID code for each person)."
