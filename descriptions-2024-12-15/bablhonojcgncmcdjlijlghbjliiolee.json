Trello has multiple boards, each board has multiple column lists, each column list has multiple cards, each card has multiple checklists and each checklist has multiple items.\nBut Trello allows you to view only starred boards at home page and reminders only at card level.\n\nWhat if you want reminders at even smaller actionable items like individual checklist items?\nWhat if you want to star few cards that you are currently working on and have a quick look at it?\nThat is where this Chrome Plugin, I call Trello Checklists, comes to rescue. \n\nIt allows you to view and manage your boards, cards and checklists.\nYou can have some of your cards as favorite for quick view and have reminders set at checklist items for specific times.\nYou can mark or unmark your checklist items from the plugin itself.\n\nReminders are great if are at actionable and smallest of the tasks, like checklist items, like any ToDo app. That is what this plugin lets you have: Reminder at Trello Card's Checklist Items.\n\nDid I mention it comes in black. Ohh it does."
