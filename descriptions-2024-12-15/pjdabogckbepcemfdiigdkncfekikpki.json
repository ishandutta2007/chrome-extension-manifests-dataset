This way you can surf safely without accidentally seeing any adult images and not modest pictures. \n\n*Comments and Feedback*\n•\tWe regularly monitor this google form, for your comments and feedback https://forms.gle/XeepEpexzu8tWTr26\n\n\nAlways on (Default) - \n•\tBy default the filter is on for every website. Use the options to enable/disable different filter features. Note that filters currently do not wok on IFrame contents (embedded content from third parties, such as ads). You can select to hide all IFrames in the options, but this may cause issues with some normal website functionality (e.g. captcha).\n\n*Warnings*\n•\tThis is not a replacement for an internet filter and should not be relied upon. It is only to provide you with an extra level of protection or for situations where you don’t have the option of installing a filter, such as your office computer. \n•\tFlash will not be blocked by the filter; you will also have to set Flash not to run automatically. To back Flash, type chrome://settings/content in the address bar, scroll down to the 'Plug-ins' section, and select 'Click to play'.\n•\tVideos will not be blocked by the filter.  \n\n*Our mission*\n•\tOur mission is to help people surf safely, especially where a regular internet filter is not an option. \n•\tThe extension will update itself automatically as we improve it and will always be 100% free.\n•\tThis filter is donated for the hatzlacha of Moshe ben Ruth, and family.\n•\tThis filter is donated for the Refuah Shelemah of Moshe Ben Chana by the Setton Family.\n•\tThis filter is donated in memory of Elan Ganeles by the Simhon Family."
