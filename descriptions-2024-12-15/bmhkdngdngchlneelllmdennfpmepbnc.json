I suggest checking out addons specifically written for those sites, like Fluff Busting Purity for Facebook or Antigram for Instagram. I'm not sure if either blocks comments, but at least you can cut out a lot of time-sucking distractions.)\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\nYou'll be notified that it can \"read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" because that's how it works - it hides certain comment-related elements on the page so you don't see them.\n\nCONTRIBUTING\n\nIf you notice a commenting system that could be added (blocked), open an issue (see \"support\" link). Include the website where you noticed it, and I'll try to follow-up as time permits.\n\nAdditionally, if you're comfortable with regex and html/css, you could just create a pull request against the file that defines which sites and html elements are blocked, here: https://github.com/grantwinney/hide-comments-everywhere/blob/master/sites/sites.json\n\nNEED HELP?\n\nHave a question, comment or request?\n\nOpen a new issue (see \"support\" link) with as many details as possible. The more you let me know upfront, the less I'll have to ask later!"
