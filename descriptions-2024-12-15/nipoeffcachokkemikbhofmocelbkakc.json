This may affect the performance of the webpage if those assets are slow. With this extension, simple click on the toolbar when you are on that webpage. The next time you visit that webpage, assets from sources not from the original domain will be blocked.\n\nFor example, if you visit archive.org and it has an archive of yahoo.com and you view that archive, the main document will load but it will still try to load images/CSS from yahoo.com. With this extension, when you visit archive.org, any assets that are not hosted on archive.org will be blocked."
