This is necessary because certain sites (like this) and their security measures may prevent the extension from accessing and reading their content.\n\nThe extension serves as a replacement for the built-in Ctrl+F search functionality, offering the additional capability to find similar matches, starting with the closest matches.\n\nWith this extension, misspellings are no longer an issue. It can handle slight variations and still locate the intended search pattern. Moreover, there are no limitations on the length of the search pattern."
