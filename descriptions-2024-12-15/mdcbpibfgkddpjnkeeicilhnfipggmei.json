If we’re going to ignore the situation and do nothing about it, we might as well enjoy ourselves while you’re at it and truly bathe in a blissful pre-existing state of denial  :) \n\nOR, you know, do something about it. \nRead up on the situation\nMake a donation to the White Helmets or any of the relief organizations\nAnything else you can think of and/or that is in your power. \n\nPS: I want to be very clear this is a sarcastic chrome extension intended to highlight our denial and inaction over the situation in Aleppo, and double as a call to action for being informed, making even the smallest donations, and bigger change if in our power. \n\nPS#2: This Chrome extension isn’t perfect - I’m not a coder by nature and am still working on making it switch ALL mentions of Aleppo rather than select ones. Sure, this is WIP but it’s all about making a point. And really, you shouldn’t be installing it… Shout out to OG source code 'Dump Trump' on GitHub."
