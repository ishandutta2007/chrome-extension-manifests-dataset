The extension stays dormant when the browser is used to access any site other than a supported mail interface.\n\nWhen the extension recognizes a supported interface it offers the user to digitally sign the mail before or when he clicks the 'Send' button. When the user chooses to sign his signatures are added as additional attachments to the mail in the standard PKI - CMS format (RFC #5652).\n\nWhen such a signed mail is received the extension helps the user to verify the senders' signatures. It displays the result of such verification within the mail client page itself.\n\nIt offers the user the certainty that the mail is genuinely from the claimed sender. This goes a long way in preventing users from clicking unsafe links and attachments and significantly reduce the efficacy of phishing and ransomware.\n\nWhen a signed mail is received in a browser without this extension, the users can continue to read the mail as if it is not signed. His usual mailing experience is not impacted in any way.\n\nThe extension also allows the recipient of a email to archive the mail body or one or more of the attachments as data attached signatures in CMS format. This will help in creating permanent authenticated business communication records.\n\nThe known supported mail clients are:\n1. Microsoft 365 Outlook (outlook.live.com, outlook.office.com, outlook.office365.com)\n2. Gmail (also supports Google Workspace)\n3. Any mail service that uses the RoundCube code base\n4. GoDaddy Webmail (email.godaddy.com)\n\nThe extension may work on other mail clients if they follow the page formats of these clients.\n\nOdyssey Technologies, the publisher of this extension also publish extensions for native mail clients like Mozilla Thunderbird, Gmail, Microsoft 365 and the mail authentication and verification works seamlessly across all these mail clients including this.\n\nThe extension does not collect or store any other data than described above."
