These scores are presented in a table on the player page in HTP.\n\nAlso reported are each player's AMTS scores which are essentially modified HTMS values utilizing only the skills relevant to the outfield position being analyzed. Additionally, users with U21 and NT scout access within HTP will see these AMTS values on player search and player list tables that display the required skills."
