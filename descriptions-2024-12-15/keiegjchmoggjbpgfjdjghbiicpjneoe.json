This requires extra software from: https://github.com/compsocial/nothing-to-hide\n\nNothing to Hide is a Chrome extension for Gmail that makes your email messages vaguer. After you compose a message, this extension replaces any overly specific words and phrases with appropriate, but much vaguer alternatives. The intended recipient can (hopefully) still understand the transformed message but snoopers (hopefully) cannot. Part experiment, part art project, Nothing to Hide wants to let you communicate with people you already know while simultaneously hiding your text in the background noise of the internet. We see our primary adversary as widespread passive internet surveillance and user modeling. In other words, Nothing to Hide seeks to making mining and modeling difficult because some data were never written down.\n\nThis project is its very early stages of development. On rare occasions, it might tele-transport your computer to the event horizon. Also, due to its reliance on natural language processing toolkits, this version only supports the English language, sorry :("
