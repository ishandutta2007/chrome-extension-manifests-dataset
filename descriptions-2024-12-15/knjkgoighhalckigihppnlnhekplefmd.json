For both features, no data gets sent to Slapdash servers.\n\nWhen opening the Command Bar while looking at a page in Chrome, the Command Bar will recommend contextual commands based on the page you are on. \n\nThis extension also makes the overall Slapdash experience faster, with tab recycling. When opening something from Slapdash, the extension will prevent the loading of a new tab, opting to re-use an already-open one instead.\n\nInstalling the extension will also make connecting applications easier: providing better recommendations and cutting down the manual steps required to connect certain apps.\n\nIf you can't use the Slapdash desktop app, this extension will also give you a Command Bar that will work on any page you have open in Chrome."
