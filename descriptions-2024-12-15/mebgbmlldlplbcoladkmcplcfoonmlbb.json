There was no consistency. When I'm cooking, I need the ingredients and instructions...nothing more. That's why Simplify Recipe was created.\n\nWhen you use Simplify Recipe, you won't have to deal with all the extra ads or popups. Your screen will automatically stay on. And you'll have a delightfully consistent cooking experience.\n\nIf you want, you can save your recipes for later to your very own cookbook."
