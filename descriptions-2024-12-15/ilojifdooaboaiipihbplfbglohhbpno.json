Some people tell us facts. Some tell us how to think. And some tell us how to feel. Do you spend time on high-quality sites where ideas are shared? Or do you spend your time looking at web sites meant to tickle you basest emotions?\n\nWe propose an experiment. Take the keywords meant to illicit an emotion away, and see if you find any ideas remaining as you use the internet.\n\nUpdate Notes:\n1.2.0.1 - Support for constantly changing sites like Twitter and Facebook, which cannot be handled one time at page load.\n\n1.1.0.1 - You can see and control what words are replaced.\n\nInspired by Tim Pool from Timcast IRL. Explore the context of the news and blogs you read, while looking for enraging shorthand. Remove Trigger Words for a safer experience.\n\nThis plugin is for anyone who wants to try and spare themselves from negative triggering words, or who want to look for underlying patterns in what they read. Or people who just want a good laugh."
