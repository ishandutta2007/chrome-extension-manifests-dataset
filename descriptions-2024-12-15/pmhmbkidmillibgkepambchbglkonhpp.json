It functions by automatically blocking non-educational YouTube videos, ensuring that kids engage with content that meets their learning needs. As children watch approved educational videos, they earn focus points, which they can later redeem to explore a broader range of content while staying within parental-defined boundaries. Complementing this, a user-friendly web dashboard empowers parents with insights into their child's online activities, offering access to viewing history and vital information. FocoKidz seamlessly combines protection and exploration, providing a holistic solution for safer and more responsible digital engagement for kids. \n\nInstructions:\nYou can install our chrome web extension for free but if you want all the other complete features, then you must create a account on our website(https://focokidz.streamlit.app/). Make sure that you use the same gmail as your chrome profile and make sure you have sync enabled."
