For any other cool sites you find, TryThis is available directly from the toolbar. Simply click on a channel and your link will appear within milliseconds.\n\n With TryThis, you can customize the name of your webhook, give it an emote or profile picture URL, and manage visible channels, all within a few clicks and all without ever having to log in to Slack.\n\nView the source code here: https://github.com/nexuist/TryThis"
