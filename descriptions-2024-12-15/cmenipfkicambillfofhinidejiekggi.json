For example, if the item you are looking at online at Home Depot is less expensive at Lowes or a different Home Depot location, you will see a red BuildClub icon on the Home Depot page.  A green icon, means you found the best price in your searchable range, as set in the extension settings.  The default distance is 1,000 miles.\n\nONE CLICK TO CHANGE THE STORE YOU ARE SHOPPING\nYou can click on the extension icon and see a list of stores along with prices and inventory levels you can sort for convenience.  Find the price, quantity and distance you like?  Then click on the button in the dropdown box, and we will change to the proper store/location for you to complete your order.  Super simple.\n\nLet the BuildClub act as your copilot when purchasing materials.  Our service is 100% free, and our goal is to bring transparency to the building materials market and save small contractors money and time.\n\nAre you an Independent Hardware Store?  If so, you can now use the BuildClub PriceFinder on AceNet and Orgill! With this capability, you will see the actual local price of items you are considering purchasing on AceNet or Orgill for your inventory, so you can make better purchasing decisions and track competitive pricing.  We will show you the local price at Home Depot, Lowe's and Amazon.  A subscription is required for this capability, and we offer a free trial so you can check it out. \n\nBy installing, you agree to our terms of service at https://buildclub.com/home-terms-and-conditions/.\n\nThe service is presently only available for the United States."
