A popup will appear to inform you about the number of words in the selected text. Besides this number, it also informs you about average word length, number of total characters, number of special characters, and the longest word. This addon has no settings or options to adjust. Simply add it to your browser and start using it. It works on any web page as long as you can select a word or sentence. Please note that this addon does not have a toolbar icon.\n\nIf you want to report bugs or have a feature request, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/word-counter.html)."
