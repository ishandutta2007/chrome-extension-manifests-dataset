All too often, meetings are scheduled without fully considering their necessity, an optimal approach, or attendee relevance.\n\nWith WhyMeet, you'll have the power to make informed decisions about your meetings and optimize them for efficiency, productivity, and cost-effectiveness, taking into account the cost of salaries, meeting length, and participant involvement.\n\nYou'll be able to:\n* See the cost of all your meetings over time\n* Determine the average cost of your meetings\n* Optimize meeting length and participant list for cost-effectiveness\n\nAnd with its integration with Google Calendar, WhyMeet makes it easy to see the cost impact of your meetings in real time as you schedule them.\n\nBut why stop there? Get actionable, AI-powered suggestions based on your unique organizational context, as well as playbooks and immediately usable resources for async communication and planning without meetings.\n\nOver 70% of meetings are considered to be unproductive! That's an insane statistic, especially considering that Zoom has over 200,000 enterprise customers and shares meeting volumes in the *trillions* of minutes. The financial impact of unproductive meetings is very real to any given company, as well as to the economy at large."
