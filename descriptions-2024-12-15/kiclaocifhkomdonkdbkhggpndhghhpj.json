When launched within a Chrome Browser, it will interrogate the Chrome OS device to gather key system inventory details and monitor online activity. The data collected is dynamically sent to your local CrossTec EMS Server and is then available for reporting within the CrossTec EMS Management Console. \n\nSupported Features:\n\nReal-time Monitoring - An Admin or Teacher via the Console can view a real-time summary of all Chrome OS devices. Selected devices can be viewed either in a detailed list view or via real-time thumbnails of each device screen.\n\nSafeguarding Keyword Monitoring (Education version) – This tool helps schools protect students from being exposed to inappropriate online content. It alerts staff when students type or search for any terms that match with those in the EMS keyword database, providing safeguarding and internet safety indicators for self-harm, bullying, radicalisation, Child Sexual exploitation - and much more.\n\nSafeguarding Report a Concern (Education version) - Students can report concerns directly and discreetly to nominated school staff.\n\nInternet Metering - A summary of Internet activity via the extension is recorded, including start and finish times for each URL visited and the active time spent on a page.\n\nHardware Inventory - When the Chrome Browser is launched on a device, an inventory is dynamically sent to the CrossTec EMS Server. \n\nEnterprise Alerting - Real-time alerts enable Console operators to immediately identify any user who has triggered a Safeguarding keyword.\n\nActivity - Console operators can see a chronological view of device activity for a selected time period, including triggered Safeguarding phrases.\n\nFor more information on CrossTec EMS (or to download a full evaluation version of the entire solution) please visit our website.\n\nInstallation of the CrossTec EMS Agent Extension should be centrally managed via the Google Admin Console.
