When debugging parameters passed into a url or just curiosity. I recently had to debug an issue and had to inspect the query string manually many times. I could have used Fiddler or Charles Proxy to see the values in a table form. I could have just copy and paste into notepad, but why leave the browser and deal with another app when I could just simply create an extension to do help me do this quickly.\n\nI created this quick extension to make it so I could see the current tab's query string parameters at a click of a button, right from Chrome.\n\nPlease provide feedback or feature requests. You could also contribute to the extension as it's made open source at the GitHub Repo: https://github.com/acolchado/query-string-values-extension"
