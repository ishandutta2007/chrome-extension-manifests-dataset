Temp Access solves this by allowing you to make temporary passwords that friends, freelancers, and teammates can use to log in to an account without you having to share your private passwords or changing them after they are finished. \n\nSign up at tempaccess.org to get started making temporary passwords, and install this extension to use the temporary passwords to log in on almost any website. Contact us at support@tempaccess.org for any questions about our service, pricing, or terms of use."
