Users can hover their browser’s cursors over a person's name anywhere on the internet and access a drop down list of news articles, reports and judicial proceedings related to misappropriation of public funds.\n\nAllowing the Kenyan public access to this information in a condensed, one-stop-shop manner is meant to provide people with a greater sense of awareness and hopefully inspire the citizenry to hold all individuals and entities to account.\n\nThis plugin works on the basis of media reports that mention the said individuals' names in relation to offences or alleged offences in contravention of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, Proceeds of Crime and Money Laundering Act and Bribery Act. You can view the methodology at https://wizileaks.africauncensored.online/#/methodology\n\nEvery individual has a rebuttable presumption of innocence. It is against this backdrop that any and all mentions save for convictions by a court of competent jurisdiction are on the basis of “innocent until proven guilty.”\nFor any comments/complaints about how this plugin works, please write us through https://africauncensored.online/feedback/"
