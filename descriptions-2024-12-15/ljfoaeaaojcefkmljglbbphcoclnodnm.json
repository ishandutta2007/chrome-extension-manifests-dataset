It's ideal for boards that have large number of columns catering to many different roles.\n\nFor example, you might have a board that Product Managers, Developers, and Designers use. Yet each role only cares about certain columns. You could easily create a \"PM\" view, a \"Dev\" view, and a \"Design\" view each with their own set of columns.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Click on the Extension in your Browser\n2. Click \"Configure Views\"\n3. Add views by specifying their name, and then a comma-separated list of column names that you want active for that view.\n4. Click \"Save\".\n5. Now launch a Trello board, and then click on the Extension and select your view.\n\nSend your feedback to info@bitesite.ca!"
