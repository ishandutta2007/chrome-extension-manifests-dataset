But sometimes, we have a tendency to “over share” and provide anyone with information that used to be at least semi-private. Birthdates, anniversaries, names of our children and significant others. There also tends to be habit of using this information when creating passwords since that information is easy to remember being near and dear to our hearts.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a problem. “Hackers” can formulate this knowledge into a Social Engineering attack. \n\nSocialSec is a Chrome extension designed to help keep you and your accounts safe from these attacks by comparing the public information posted to your social media accounts to passwords your are using or creating.\n\nHow do we do this?\nSocialSec creates a custom word list based on public profile information. This word list also contains commonly found substitutions, i.e. @ for A, 3 for E and so on\n\nCurrently, SocialSec can only pull information from these social media sites:\nFacebook\n\nOnce you’ve signed into your social media, you’re all set! \nSocialSec protects you in the background and will notify you when it detects a match between your word list and a password you are currently using or a password you are attempting to create. SocialSec will then run you through the actions you can take concerning this password.\n\nWhat information do you use?\nAt this time, we can only pull the most public information from Facebook, but we hope to change this in the near future to include any and all public information you would like to have in your word list.\n\nSocialSec was designed as an Arizona State University Capstone project. Your constructive feedback will help us refine SocialSec for future releases.\n\nThank you for using SocialSec!"
