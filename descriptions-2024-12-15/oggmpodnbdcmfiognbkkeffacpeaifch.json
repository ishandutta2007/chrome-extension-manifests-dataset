The easiest way to select the location of your photos is to click on the map. Alternatively, you can search for a place from the search field; selecting a result will update the coordinates of your photo. \nIt is possible to change the size of the map in the extension's options.\nThe extension works when opening a picture from the Browse and the Library menus. \n\nBulk update is supported as well:\n- select all the photos that you want to update, \n- click on the map pin icon that appears in the bottom-right corner (where the number of selected photos is usually shown), \n- a map will appear in the center of the screen, \n- choose a location and then click on the save icon (again, bottom-right corner).\n\nThe map used is Google Maps and it is hosted by Valerio Technologies AB. \n\nRelease 2.1:\nCorrect issue so the extension does not pop-up every time the browser updates to the latest version."
