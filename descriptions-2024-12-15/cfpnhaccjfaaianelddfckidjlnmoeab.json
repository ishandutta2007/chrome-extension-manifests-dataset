This tool is being provided for free as a gesture of good will. I built this tool as I needed my transactions for tax filing purposes and Robinhood’s support was no help. Robinhood’s transaction cards constantly change their format and are quite messy to begin with. This extension contains my best attempt at parsing them and extracting data in a clean format, but I make no promises on completeness or correctness of the data in the CSV file. \n\nFeedback, Questions, or Concerns? Please send an email: RHToCSV@gmail.com\n\nUpdates:\n\nV0.0.2: \n- Fixed options parsing to work with new Robinhood card html\n\nV0.0.3: \n- Fixed date and time parsing to work with new Robinhood card html\n\nV0.0.4: \n- Major update to make sure it works with the current Robinhood card HTML"
