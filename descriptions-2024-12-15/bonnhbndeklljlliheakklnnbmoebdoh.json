Yet, paradoxically, browsing the internet today is a solitary experience. The websites you visit may have thousands of concurrent visitors, but the user and the site alone seem to exist in a vacuum. In cases where the website does not provide a local platform for communication, such as a chat platform or a commenting system, the browsing visitor has no means of interacting with the other people visiting the same website at the same time. This invention connects people concurrently using the same website, if they so desire, without any changes needed for the website.\n\n● SUMMARY\nVCU is a novel method for visualizing and connecting concurrent website visitors with each other. In a universal communication layer across all websites on the internet. Using the popularity and the amount of activity of each website, the invention is also able to generate ranked and sorted link-lists of where everybody currently are and what websites currently are the most popular."
