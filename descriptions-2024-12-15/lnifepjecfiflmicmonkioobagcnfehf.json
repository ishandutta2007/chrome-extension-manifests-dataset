As of version 2.0, it has a secondary purpose, fixing a bug in the submission page. More details are given below.\n\nThe add-on kicks in when the user requests a report from ECCC (i.e. when the user goes to any URL of the form https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/*/download/).\n\nThe add-on then intercepts the response from the server, which asks the browser to download a pdf file, and changes it so that the browser is now requested to open the pdf file.\n\nVersion 2.0 Update: There was a bug in the submission process that caused you to restart your submission. The extension now fixes that bug to the best of my knowledge. Details available with source code at https://github.com/suhailsherif/eccc-fixes."
