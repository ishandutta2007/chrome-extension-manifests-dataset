This allows for full screen browsing with a simple, list of your favorite websites. This is also a useful tool if you like to open the same websites every so often. I am still working on building this simple yet helpful tool out with features like importing and exporting.\n\nAny feedback is good feedback. Let me know if you have bugs, feature requests or anything! \n\nFeatures planned: Better importing & exporting, backing up and folders. Let me know if you have any to add :)\n\n(Although this application does require a permission for your tabs / bookmarks, nothing is sent back and forth between your browser and me. This application has been totally open sourced  over at github here -> https://github.com/jackhanford/Bookmarker )\n\nNew in version 0.1.5: Restored remove all functionality\n\nNew in version 0.1.4: HotKey support! To open your favorite bookmarks, just click Ctrl+Shift+X or on mac, Command+Shift+X!!"
