This extension is of no use to those not associated with this University.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Use Ctrl+left and Ctrl+right to navigate to previous and future sessions.\n\n- Use Ctrl+up to navigate to the ‘current’ session (rolls over in June).\n\n- The year in the title banner also has links to these sessions added.\n\n- Plain text course codes are converted into proper links, so you can now click on any cross-references within course descriptors.\n\n- A coloured toolbar icon indicates whether the current page is old or new, and provides a menu that you can also navigate with. (If you don't like/need the icon, you can remove it by right-clicking on it, and choosing the corresponding option.)\n\nVersion 0.0.5 contains technical changes so that the extension will still work after Google's upcoming changes to the Chrome browser (enforcing use of \"manifest v3\"). Otherwise it should work the same as before."
