Click the icon to activate the extension.  In the form that pops up, type or paste in as many URLs as you like.  Each one will be opened in a new tab.\n\nAll URLs entered must be valid.  Valid URLs are links like \"http://example.com\", and \"example.com\".  \n\nBad URLs are single word links (no .com, .net, etc..) and links with spaces.  These are bad links: \"example\", \"my example.com\".\n\nOpen Links in Tabs is a free extension that runs right from your computer.  It dosen't redirect you to a website that opens links for you; the links are opened right from the Chrome browser itself.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using this simple but effective extension!"
