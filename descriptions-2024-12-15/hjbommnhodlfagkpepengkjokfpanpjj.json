This  extension automatically displays historical prices of the product you are currently viewing right on the page. It also includes a Cigar Bid Free Fall tracker. This feature improves upon others that are available by permanently remembering the lowest price you have ever seen for a specific product during a free fall auction.  When you navigate away, refresh, or just happen to come across the same product being offered again as a free fall auction, this extension will show you the lowest free fall price you have ever seen, as well as the lowest price for your current viewing session."
