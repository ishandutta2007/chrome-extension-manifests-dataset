This is especially useful in situations where bad deployments to production could be very impactful or difficult to fix (e.g. when your team lead is sleeping).\n\n* Switch to toggle merge prevention functionality on or off. \n* Syncs settings across all your devices to prevent mishaps.\n* Dynamic page updates every minute and every time a setting is changed. This is to avoid having to refresh the page.\n\nNote: This extension is only functional for Gitlab.\n\nFuture development: functionality to change the timeframe based on day of week."
