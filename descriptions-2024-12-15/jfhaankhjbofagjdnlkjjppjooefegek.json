However, it can be easy to grant a permission on a whim and then forget about it.\n\nKill Switch can monitor sites' usage of these powerful APIs and let you know when they're being invoked. Additionally, it can provide a further degree of control by prompting you for permission every session, instead of just once.\n\nPlease note that this is intended to be a privacy tool, not a security one! This means that a malicious website could easily deactivate Kill Switch and use the APIs regardless of your settings. Instead, consider Kill Switch as a tool to offer you insight into how and when your data is being used."
