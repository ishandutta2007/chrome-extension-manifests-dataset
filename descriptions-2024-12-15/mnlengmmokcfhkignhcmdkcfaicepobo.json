Or wish you could get more gifts or followers? \n\nIf these questions sound like you - we're excited to introduce you to Chat Capture! \n\nOpen Chat Capture on your TikTok live URL in the browser and collect comments from your chat.

Solve the captchas to prevent your live from ending. They usually occur after 1 or 4 hours of going live and 4 hours after you solve a captcha.\n- At the start of each live session, be sure to click \"Clear History\" to prevent the system from selecting games that have already been played.\n- Log into TikTok on your laptop before scraping comments from your live session URL. An example of a live session URL is: https://www.tiktok.com/@yourcoder/live.\n- The browser window for scraping comments must be at least partially visible on your screen to keep it active and scraping.\n\nLinks you should check out:\n\n- Getting Started: https://www.runchatcapture.com/cc/getting-started\n- Privacy Policy: https://www.runchatcapture.com/cc/privacy-policy"
