Have you ever pressed 'paste' (ctrl+v) and been disappointed that you lost something you typed or were trying to save?\n\nThis happened to me so many times that I decided to write an extension: ClipSave to the rescue!\n\nClipSave is simple extension, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do... it saves your clipboard locally on your computer so when you click the icon you can see a history of all the things you copied. You can also delete individual items or clear the whole bin! \n\nThere are other extensions that do this, but they were all too complicated to use and set up, required account creation, and have all these bells and whistles I didn't need, so I made something that simply solves the problem. \n\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I do and it boost your productivity and saves you from losing your clipboard!\n\nWhen you install this extension, it will ask you for permission to  access your clipboard.\n\n(this product is not associated with Microsoft in any way, i just thought that clippy would make a great mascot!)"
