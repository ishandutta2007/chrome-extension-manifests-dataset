Basically it could turn anything into a Spotify player, and control it with your cellphone. I made this app trying to connect Spotify with Chrome.(Check it out: Firefox version is released!)\n\nBy the restriction of Spotify, this add-on only works with Spotify premium account.\n\nWhy use this player instead of Spotify website?\n\n   1. Play in background of Chrome, no need to keep Spotify website open;\n   2. Global keyboard shortcut to play/stop/next/previous/like; (\"Like\" means to save the track into your library.)\n   3. Transfer playback to Chrome seamlessly with just one click.\n\nDefault keyboard shortcuts\nPlay previous track:  Ctrl+shift+7\nPlay or pause:            Ctrl+shift+8\nPlay next track:          Ctrl+shift+9\nSave the track:           Ctrl+shift+0\n\nA small gadget just makes life a little bit easier.\n\nBesides, it's open source!\nhttps://github.com/revir/spotify-on-browser\nRead more: https://revir.github.io/2021/01/16/Spotify-on-Chrome/ \nFeedback can also be here: https://pnlpal.dev/category/3/feedback"
