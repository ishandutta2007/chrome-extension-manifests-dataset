Designed to eliminate interruptions to your workflow, our extension allows you to effortlessly copy multiple items from the web and paste them directly into a rich text editor within the popup, all without disrupting your browsing rhythm. Simply select text, hold for a moment, and watch as it seamlessly transfers to the editor, where you can make quick edits and annotations on the fly. Stay organized by adding titles to your notes with a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+X), and capture the context of your research by including the URL of the current webpage with another quick keystroke (Ctrl+Shift+L). When you're ready to use your notes elsewhere, a convenient copy button in the popup lets you copy everything from the editor with ease. Plus, with the toggle button on the popup, you have full control to start and stop note-taking sessions at your convenience, giving you the freedom to focus on browsing or capturing information as needed. Say hello to a smoother, more efficient research experience – try our Chrome extension today!"
