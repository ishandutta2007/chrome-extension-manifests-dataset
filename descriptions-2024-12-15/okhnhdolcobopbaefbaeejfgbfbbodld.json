If they are all found (in any order), the post is hidden. Example: Ronaldo,Messi,GOAT\nb) Phrase: whatever phrase you want, for example: The Royal Family\nc) Regular Expression: this one should be used only by people who have programming knowledge and know how regular expressions work.\n\nNews Feed Sanitizer works on all major social networks (Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok and others - see screenshots)."
