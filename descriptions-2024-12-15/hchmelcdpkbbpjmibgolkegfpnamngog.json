Well, now you can know beforehand! With GPTstatus, you can know for sure if ChatGPT is down or not _before_ you try it.\n\nAnd guess what. When ChatGPT isn't down, it functions as a handy little shortcut button to open up ChatGPT quickly and easily. If you already have an open tab buried in your tab bar, it'll take you there instead of opening a whole new tab for minimum tab clutter!\n\nIf you're already on the ChatGPT tab, clicking the toolbar icon will open a panel with more details.\n\nPretty cool, huh?"
