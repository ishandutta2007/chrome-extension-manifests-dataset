For the rest of us there is \"Password Peek\" for Google Chrome.  \"Password Peek\" places a button next to password fields that, when held down will show your password in place of the asterisks allowing you to check it.  You can also press the padlock button to keep the password visible allowing you to edit it while seeing it!\n\nHow many times have you gone to enter a password into another device but you are unable to remember it as chrome has it saved and automatically inserts it into the password field, obscured of course!  Simply use \"Password Peek\" to show the password!"
