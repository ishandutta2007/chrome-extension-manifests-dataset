For example, getting ready for work and want to read an article on the web while fixing breakfast? Navigate to the page click the extension icon, select the content want to read and hit the play button to have the extension read the contents out loud to you. \nPerforming some chore while you want to read content on a webpage, this extension has you covered as well.\n\nThis extension has a UI with three buttons: the play button, the stop button and the theme toggle button that switches the theme from dark to light and vice-versa."
