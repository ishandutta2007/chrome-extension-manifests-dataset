By representing each week of your life as a small block, it provides a powerful perspective on time, encouraging reflection on personal mortality and the value of each passing week.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Weekly Life Visualization**: See your life laid out in weeks, with lived weeks distinctly colored from those yet to come.\n- **Personalization**: Input your birth date and expected lifespan for a tailored visualization.\n- **New Tab Integration**: Replaces your new tab page with your life visualization, promoting regular reflection.\n- **Dark/Light Mode**: Switch between dark and light themes for comfortable viewing in any environment.\n- **Privacy-Centric**: All personal data is stored locally in your browser; no information is sent or stored externally.\n- **Cross-Browser Support**: Compatible with both Firefox and Chrome (and Chromium-based browsers).\n\n### Purpose\n\nLife in Weeks aims to provide a visual reminder of life's finite nature, encouraging users to contemplate their life choices, priorities, and the passage of time. It's not just a tool, but a philosophical prompt that can inspire mindfulness and intentional living.\n\n### Open Source\n\nThis project is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community. Whether you're a developer, designer, or just have ideas for improvement, your input is valuable.
