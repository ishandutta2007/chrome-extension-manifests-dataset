When it comes to the mountain of information out there, simple is good.\n\nNow there are no dead ends. Every web site is a potential launch pad into even more interesting stuff! Use anywhere. News, shopping, travel ... anything.\n\nInstructions: Once installed just click on the Blink icon to temporarily change all the links on the page to Google searches. Then simply click on those links and you're away! \n\nNote: Above and beyond cookies, some sites think it's OK to covertly intercept URLs and use your click data for pushing products and ads without telling you. If Blink doesn't go to a Google search that is probably what they are doing. In this case just right click and choose \"Open link in new tab\".\n\nFlush out fake news, get another view point\nCompare deals\nGet product reviews\nIdentify sites that are masking URLs\nSee where it takes you!"
