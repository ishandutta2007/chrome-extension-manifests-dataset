If you're switching browsers there's an import/export feature to help make that process as simple as possible.\n\nIf you're interested in how this extension came to be... I built V1 of this tool for my own benefit, however since trying out Arc browser I realised it doesn't work with Arc's command bar. I looked back at the original code for a way to make it work with Arc when I realised there were some big things that needed to be fixed and so I rebuilt it (almost) from scratch with a new design and some much needed features (including Arc support).\n\nIf you enjoy the tool and want to support its maintenance, there's a 'buymeacoffee' link in the options page.\n\nThanks QL :)"
