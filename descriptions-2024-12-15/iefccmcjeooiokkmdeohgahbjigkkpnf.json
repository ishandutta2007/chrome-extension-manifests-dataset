Annoyingly, many marketplaces like Ebay doesn't allow for taking notes on an item without adding it to the watchlist. When I see a flaw on the item I am buying, I usually pass on it. However sometimes, hunting down an item we want can take months, waiting for just the right copy. If you find yourself going back to the same item over and over again, this plugin can help you manage your notes and prevent you from wasting time on the same item over and over again. The plugin allows you to save your notes on the items as your browse and categorize them in an intuitive way. Works across 52 worldwide marketplaces \n\n Requires a free LOVGC account to use. This is required to back up the comments you saved and display them to you across devices. \n\nThis plugin is not affiliated with Ebay or any other marketplace in any way."
