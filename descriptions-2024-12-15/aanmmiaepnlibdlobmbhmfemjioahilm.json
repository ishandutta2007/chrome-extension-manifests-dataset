Since our app is deployed as a Chrome extension, we decided to add extra local features such as speech recognition and text-to-speech, a WebRTC webcam, HTML5 notifications, access to ChromeDB, a gamepad controller, and access to local and remote Arduino and Spark devices via our Microblu OS.\n\nYou can run your Nodeblu flows on our servers by signing up for an Octoblu account today!  \n\nFor more information, please visit http://octoblu.com and http://skynet.im. #HackIoT"
