Clicking on said option opens a full preview of the post that can be closed by clicking on \"Expand\" again. The preview can be resized by using the provided edge on its bottom-right corner. You can edit your settings by clicking on the extension's icon while visiting Reddit.\n\nPlease note that, although it works in some instances, posts that refer to websites other than Reddit might not load at all. This happens because the third-party website does not allow previews in iframes (e.g. YouTube).\n\nThis extension uses the jQuery library that can be found at http://jquery.com/"
