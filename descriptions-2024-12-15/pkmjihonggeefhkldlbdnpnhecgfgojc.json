You can at any time undo the tweet, to cancel the countdown, make changes, and hit the Tweet button again for a new countdown.\n\nHow many times have you had spelling errors?\nYou hate tweeting too fast and then regretting that offending message?\n\nNo more! have a safety tweet button that guards you from making these mistakes.\n\nAre you 100% sure of yourself? double-click the Tweet button to bypass the Undo functionality.\n\n\n\n✅    Pause the live feed\n\nDo you find it annoying that Twitter auto-refreshes the timeline and updates the feed with new tweets while you are scrolling? Me too. That's essentially why I started building this extension. It made it really hard for me to find conversations while scrolling.\n\nThis feature allows you to pause/resume the live feed updates with a click of a button. Like, literally!\n\n\n\n✅    Random happy dogs pictures\n\nIt is sometimes very lonely at Twitter. I feel that too.\n\nDo you feel like you need a cute picture or gif of a dog to turn up your happiness level? Say no more. I got your back. One click button to show you a random cute pup in action.\n\n\n\n✅   Minimalistic permissions\n\nI'm very conscious of the security and privacy of you as an individual.\n\nThis extension only requires the set of permissions that it absolutely needs in order to function properly:\n   * storage - to save your customized settings\n\n   * webRequest & webRequestBlocking - to monitor twitter's HTTP requests to load timeline tweets in your timeline so it can block them, thus disabling the automatic live feed refresh.\n\n   * only operates on the limited set of URL addresses conforming to this pattern ://*.twitter.com/* and so it avoids injecting itself to all other URLs and websites.\n\n\n\n✅   Open Source\n\nThe open-source and public-facing part of this extension is managed in the open on GitHub https://github.com/lirantal/twiks and it only includes the code related to the Undo button, which is part of the freemium offering of this extension. If you wish to receive the full source code for the extension for educational purposes (or security scrutiny) I'm happy to make it available for you. Just contact me and I'll send you a copy."
