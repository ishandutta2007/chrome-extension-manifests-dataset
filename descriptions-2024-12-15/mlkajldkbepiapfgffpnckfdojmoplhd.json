A browser extension that finds all parentheses on any website and collapses them. Expand them as needed.\n\nFolding parentheses makes information more accessible: It is easier to read over long and complex articles without loosing focus.\n\nTo put it short: Read less - understand more.\n\n*\n\nBy design, parentheses enrich content with relevant but often unnecessary information.\n\nEvery long sentence filled with parentheses is a challenge for the reader to differentiate between: What is important and what isn't?\n\nSurprisingly often, the content written between parentheses can be skipped without loosing anything. And in fact, any sentence that requires the reader to read what is written inside parentheses is a failed construction by its author.\n\nMost of the time, parentheses just blow up the content with lots of information of little meaning. At the same time, this is what makes meaningful content harder to access and understand.\n\nWe read over these pieces of extra details because we have to: there was no way to opt-out. Now there is."
