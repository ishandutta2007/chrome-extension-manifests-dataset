It was very useful for non-English URLs, to share later on social media/send to friends. If the social media didn't render the preview - you could paste the full \"gibberish\" URL first, let it render the preview and then change the address to the \"nice\" short link in the native language.\n\nDeveloping this tiny extension allowed me to make the process even more efficient, by adding a menu option to the mouse right click anywhere on the page, rather than messing with the tiny address bar. Clicking on the extension icon in the toolbar opens a dialog box if you need to edit the address.\n\nIf you have an idea for useful extension/mobile app/online tool - feel free to contact me^-^"
