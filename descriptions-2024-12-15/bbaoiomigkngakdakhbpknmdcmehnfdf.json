This latest version contains enhanced adaptability to user preferences and a more intuitive organization of settings.\n\nA significant improvement in Version 2 is its ability to execute code even before the site has fully loaded. This contrasts with Version 1, which was limited to executing JavaScript only after the page had completed loading. For details, please visit: https://codertjp.com/docs/dpup-v2.\n\n\nFor Developers: The new update offers developers a valuable opportunity to contribute code directly to the site owner. Following approval from the community and beta testers, these contributions will be incorporated into the platform. Submissions in discord server (#code-contributions | https://discord.gg/9yqe4pUc9V)\n\nDisclaimer: By redirecting your core scripts, the website owner (@pinecone.tree) can alter the code without needing Google’s approval. This flexibility allows for quicker feature releases. However, if the site codertjp.com experiences downtime, functionality on your page at defly.io may be affected. In such instances, please disable the extension until the issue is resolved."
