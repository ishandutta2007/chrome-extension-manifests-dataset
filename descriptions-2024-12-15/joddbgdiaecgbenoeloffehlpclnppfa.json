It does exactly the same as the keyboard shortcuts (F11 on Windows or fn+F on Mac). You can change the icon to match your chrome theme and that's it.\n\nI made this because I need to be able to click a button/menu item with the mouse, not all of my browsers come with keyboard. When in full screen, I need the context menu to get back. That's why this extension adds itself in the right-menu also. And that's it.\n\nðŸ›  OPTIONS\n\nTo change the default settings, simply right-click on the extension icon and select \"Options\". On the settings page, you can change the icon to a different color  (to match your Chrome theme or simply because you don't like the default black color) or even set your own icon.\n\nðŸ”’ PERMISSIONS\n\nRest assured, this extension doesn't require any special or risky permissions. The only permissions it needs are \"contextMenu\" and \"storage.\" It doesn't access your data or sites. Its sole purpose is to add the buttons to the toolbar and context menu while saving the selected icon in local storage.",
