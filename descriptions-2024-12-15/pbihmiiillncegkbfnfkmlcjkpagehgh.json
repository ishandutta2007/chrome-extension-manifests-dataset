Or, you just like being able to see your taskbar and to easily manage the YouTube video's display.\n\nThis was made in a few hours (had to learn a bit of JavaScript and Chrome API), but I'd be happy to add any new features and to fix any bugs!\n\nGitHub (source code): https://simple-youtube-windowed-fullscreen.srnyx.com"
