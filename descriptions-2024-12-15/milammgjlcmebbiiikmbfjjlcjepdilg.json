This way you can adjust them to the number of people you expect for dinner, or enjoy your lonely meal accurately.\n\nTo use it, click the extension's icon, select the list of ingredients, and modify any of the quantities that got trapped inside the selection. Changing any of them will transform all the others proportionally.\n\nIf you liked the extension and want to support it with a small contribution, please go to buymeacoff.ee/wu6S9Ob0k\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the project, visit https://github.com/inad9300/recipe-adapter",
