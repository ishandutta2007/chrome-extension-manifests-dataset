Exporting Chrome History:\n• Install the Extension: Download and install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.\n• Open the Extension: Click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar.\n• Select a Range: Choose the date range for the history you wish to export (up to 3 months).\n• Export History: Press the \"Download History as CSV\" button. Your selected range of browser history will be saved as a CSV file on your computer.\n• View in Excel: Open the CSV file in Excel or any compatible spreadsheet software to view and analyze your browsing history.\n\n➤2. Converting Chrome History JSON from Google Takeout:\nTo bypass Chrome's 3-month history limitation, follow these steps outlined below and refer to the Important Notes section for additional details.\n\n• Download Takeout Data: Use Google Takeout (https://takeout.google.com/) to download your full Chrome browsing history as a JSON file. In the \"Create a New Export\" section of Google Takeout, select only \"Chrome > History\" and follow the steps to receive a \"History.json\" file containing your browsing history.\n• Upload JSON: In the extension, use the \"Upload\" option to select the Chrome \"History.json\" file from your computer.\n• Convert to CSV: The extension will convert the JSON file to a CSV format and automatically download it to your computer.\n• View in Excel: Open the converted CSV file in Excel or any compatible spreadsheet software to view and analyze your complete browsing history.\n\n◆ COLUMNS INCLUDED IN THE CSV:\n• client_id: The client ID associated with the visit (Each browser has a different client_id).\n• local_id: The local identifier for the visit (Associated with client_id).\n• url: The full URL of the visited page.\n• url_clean: The cleaned version of the URL (protocol and query parameters removed).\n• url_domain: The domain name extracted from the URL.\n• title: The title of the visited page.\n• time: The exact date and time of the visit, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n• hour: The hour of the visit.\n• day_of_week: The day of the week when the visit occurred (0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday).\n• is_weekend: Indicates whether the visit occurred on a weekend (1 for yes, empty otherwise).\n• day_of_month: The day of the month when the visit occurred.\n• week_of_month: The week of the month when the visit occurred.\n• month_of_year: The month of the year when the visit occurred.\n• total_history_days: The total number of distinct days included in the file.\n• seconds_until_next_visit: The number of seconds until the next visit to any URL (if no next visit, the current date is used).\n• seconds_until_next_visit_url: The number of seconds until the next visit to the exact same URL (if no next visit, the current date is used).\n• seconds_until_next_visit_url_clean: The number of seconds until the next visit to the cleaned URL (if no next visit, the current date is used).\n• seconds_until_next_visit_domain: The number of seconds until the next visit to the domain (if no next visit, the current date is used).\n• page_transition: The type of transition that led to the visit (e.g., link, bookmark https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/history#type-TransitionType).\n• id: The visit ID assigned by Chrome.\n• ref_id: The ID of the visit that referred this visit.\n\n◆ ARCHITECTURE:\n• Chrome API Usage:\nUtilizes chrome.history.search to retrieve browsing history based on user-defined time ranges.\n• IndexedDB:\nThis extension uses storage to efficiently manage and process large datasets, particularly when dealing with big Google Takeout JSON files. By utilizing IndexedDB, a robust client-side storage solution, the extension can store and retrieve large amounts of data locally without overloading the browser's memory (RAM). This approach ensures that even when handling big files, the extension remains responsive, preventing performance issues and allowing for smooth data processing.\nIndexedDB is cleared after the script runs to free up memory, ensuring that no unnecessary data is retained.\n• Asynchronous Processing:\nImplements batch processing to handle large files efficiently without blocking the browser's main thread.\nEnsures smooth performance even when processing extensive datasets.\n\n◆ PROPER USE: \nLarge Google Takeout JSON files (>100MB) may take time to process, can be memory intensive, and may cause the interface to lag. For files larger than 300MB, it is recommended to use Python for processing to avoid performance issues and ensure more efficient handling of large datasets.\n\n◆ IMPORTANT NOTES:\n• Chrome's 3-Month History Limit: The extension by default can only export history from the last 3 months due to Chrome's storage limits.\n• Older History: To access history older than 3 months, use Google Takeout to retrieve your full Chrome browsing history as a JSON file, which can then be converted to CSV using this extension. If you still cannot access history older than 3 months, you need to disable the \"Web & App Activity\" auto-delete option in your Google account's Data and Privacy settings at (https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols).\n\n◆ CHANGELOG:\n• v2.6: Resolved an issue affecting the processing of Google Takeout JSON files.\n• v2.5: Added support for large Google Takeout JSON files along with memory optimizations.\n• v2.4: Changed hours until next visit to seconds.\n• v2.3: Bug fixes.\n• v2.2: Bug fixes.\n• v2.1: Added additional calculated columns for analysis.\n• v2.0: Added support for converting Chrome History JSON files from Google Takeout to CSV.\n• v1.1: Fixed issues with CSV export, specifically concerning titles not displaying correctly.\n• v1.0: Initial release with basic functionality for exporting Chrome history to CSV.\n\n◆ Next Steps\nIf you're looking to visualize the results of your browsing history analysis, our experts have designed a comprehensive Looker Studio template that seamlessly integrates with the CSV output from this extension. This customizable dashboard allows you to easily interpret the data by providing visual insights into your browsing patterns, visit frequencies, and domain usage. By utilizing this template, you can transform raw data into an interactive experience, making it easier to identify trends, monitor productivity, and optimize your online habits.\n\nSee a live demo -\nhttps://justdataplease.com/product/chrome-browsing-history-analysis/"
