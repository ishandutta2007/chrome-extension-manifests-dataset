It displays all the images in a Tumblr blog in a convenient tiled display. The images efficiently auto-load as you scroll with a large read-ahead to reduce waiting times.\n\nCascadr allows you to explore Tumblr by clicking through to a post's previous re-blogger and also allows you to easily re-blog a post by redirecting you to your Tumblr dashboard. \n\nFrom any Tumblr page with a Tumblr URL eg. http://wonderfulgraphicdesign.tumblr.com just click the Cascadr icon and Cascadr will automatically open the blog you were browsing. If you are not currently browsing a Tumblr blog you can still open Cascadr and simply type the name of the blog you are interested in."
