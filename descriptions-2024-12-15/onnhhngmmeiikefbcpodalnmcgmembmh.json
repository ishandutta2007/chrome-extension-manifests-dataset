The games take place in a fictional pizza restaurant called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where a team of anthropomorphic animals, Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, entertain children during the day. However, at night, the animatronics become active and attempt to kill anyone in the building. \n\nThe player takes on the role of a security guard working the night shift at the restaurant, and must use security cameras and limited power to survive the animatronics' attacks. The series has spawned several sequels and spin-offs, as well as merchandise and adaptations in other media.\n\nIf you have any questions about our Five Nights at Freddy's game extension or just want to give us some feedback, feel free to send us a message or write a review!
