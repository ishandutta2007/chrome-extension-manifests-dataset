(I've posted this on the Store after being asked by friends to make the extension public.)\nIt's meant to be a time-saver, to avoid having to do those calculations manually every day.\n\nOnce you log in o MySodexo, it will show your budget for the day beside your username.\n\nI usually update the extension when something stops working (usually because Cibus changes the site, or someone finds a bug.)"
