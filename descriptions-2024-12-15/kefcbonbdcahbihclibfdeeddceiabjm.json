Overlays are much trickier and can appear in a variety of ways like: on website on load even before you can see any content, after a delay, when you move your mouse, click on something or even more creative ways.\n\nThis extension is lightweight and will close for you most of the overlays without doing anything. There is no need to click or press anything for almost any overlay. You can add specific web sites to a white list, use different timing or more aggressive overlay cleaning.\n\nThe permission to read / write needed for saving the white list.\nI hope that my extension will succeed to make your web surfing less frustrating and more pleasant.\n\nIn case you have questions, comments or suggestion you more than welcome to send me email to: removeoverlay@gmail.com\n\nwhat's new in version 1.0.4:\n* Updated algorithm.
