The results of the search are displayed as small versions of the photos in a grid of 20. It's very fast. Clicking on a photo displays a much larger version of the same photo in a browser tab. No Flickr(tm) login is required in order to view the photo.\n\nThis extension is licensed by Flickr to provide photo searches. Such licensing implies no particular endorsement by Flickr(tm) or Yahoo!(tm).\n\nThis extension attempts to provide a safe search (i.e., a search suitable for all ages), but we cannot, of course, guarantee that every photo will be suitable for a younger audience.\n\nNote that this software is intended for entertainment purposes, such as to view a bunch of cute kitten photos, or whatever. For serious research one should obtain a Flickr(tm) account and use their search facility."
