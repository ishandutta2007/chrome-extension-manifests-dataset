The salt should be stored physically, so you can recover it in the future.\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS. The crypto part works fine, but there are some jQuery/css issues on some pages (iframes, jQuery dialog etc.)\n\nCURRENT THREAT MODEL:\n* No one with an access to the PC with installed extension should be able to authenticate without knowing the correct passphrase.\n\n* The same passphrase used in two different web browsers should produce two different passwords (cryptographic salt will solve this problem).\n\n* If an attacker obtains password for some websites, she should not be able to derive passwords for another websites using that knowledge.\n\n* Attacker should not be able to brute force master passphrase from the salt and knowledge of one password (PBKDF with lots of iterations).\n\n* It provides protection against basic keyloggers (but they can read our salt from the memory / file...)\n\nFor more information, see Github repository."
