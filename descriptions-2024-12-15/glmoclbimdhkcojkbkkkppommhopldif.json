Needing to know every single perk hash and adding that permutation can be a pain. Worry no more. \n\nThis extension adds a sidebar on the right of D2Gunsmith that allows you to add the current weapon and its selected perks to a textbox that you can copy or save to a separate text file. It will organize the list into a format understood by DIM with comment fields for notes. Use the radio buttons to specify the type of roll that is being added (PvP, PvE, or GM). Use the \"INSERT\" key to quickly insert the newly selected roll into the wishlist, eliminating the need for an extra mouse click.\n\nIssues: \nAs D2Gunsmith is currently unstable, any subsequent changes to D2Gunsmith could cause DIM Wishlist Builder to have issues. Already identified issues include:\n- Incorrectly mapping dummy weapons rather than the actual weapons (fixed in 1.1.4)\n- Incorrectly mapping the enhanced perks rather than the base perk (fixed in 1.1.3)"
