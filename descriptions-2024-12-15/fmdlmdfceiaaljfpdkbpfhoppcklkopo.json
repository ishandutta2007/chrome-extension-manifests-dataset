This is an experimental feature, and the DFXP-to-SRT conversion is not perfect yet.\n• Button lookup now done by searching for button attributes rather than relying on their position in the layout\n\n***\n\nAdds simple yet powerful features to the Originator's More Actions menu to address its shortcomings and enhance user experience. The features include:\n\n• AutoQC, the titular feature, to point out shot-change guidelines violations and common language-specific issues\n• Import/Export SRT, to back up your work and restore it at need, complete with FN tags, italics and position on screen\n• Export Bilingual Table, matched segment for segment, to quickly look up past translations and highlight differences between two snapshots\n• Save KNP as CSV in your current project for your target language\n\nDisclaimer: It is understood that if your access to the platform is regulated by an NDA, its clauses apply to any materials obtained with the help of this extension and must be treated the same as you would any reference materials."
