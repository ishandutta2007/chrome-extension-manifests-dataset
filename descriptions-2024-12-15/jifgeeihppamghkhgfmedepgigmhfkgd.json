Visiting these websites creates revenue for climate change deniers. Can we really afford that?\n\nInstall Climate Block now to instantly block these websites and stop the spread of climate change denial. \n\n★ Easy Customisation\nNeed to visit a site just once? No problem. Use the “Allow this time” button and hit refresh to view the site. If you want to remove a website permanently from the block list, select ”Always allow this website”, or “Edit Blocked List” to toggle websites on/off. You can find the list of blocked sites in the Climate Block addon preferences.\n\n★ We Respect your Privacy\nClimate Block does not track, store, retain or record any of the websites you visit, or your personal data. We only ask permission to see website URL so that Climate Block can operate. \n\n★ Why these websites?  \nThe operators of the websites on the Climate Block list are funded, in part, directly or indirectly, by groups that want you to ignore rising sea levels, burning forests and warming oceans. Misinformation about climate change stops us from taking action and preparing for the changes that are already happening. Installing Climate Block means we stop supporting these messages, and stop funding them.\n \nThanks to Wesley Branton for some of the initial code from WebsiteBlocker, @matcarpenter for some of the site list ByeRupert and the Murdoch Blocker list from @emilyapocalypse."
