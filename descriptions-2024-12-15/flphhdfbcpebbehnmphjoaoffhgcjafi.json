No need to download files or learn complicated audio editing softwareâ€”just click the extension and adjust the speed and reverb however you like, or use one of the included presets!\n\nThis extension was primarily made for YouTube, but will also work on many other websites that play audio or video. Please understand that some sites aren't compatible yet, but this may improve with future releases of the extension.\n\nUpgrade to Pro to make custom presets, set your own default settings, keep the original pitch for all speeds, and to enable fine-tunable controls to get your remix just right."
