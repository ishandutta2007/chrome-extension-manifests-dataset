Selectext lets you easily copy on-screen text directly from any video.\n\nCopy notes from lectures, code from tutorials, links from social media videos, or even handwritten text in seconds.\n\nSelectext is designed to speed up your workflow without getting in the way. The video you are watching will be seamlessly enhanced with the ability to copy text - even in full screen. It’s the fastest way to grab the text you want without any unnecessary steps.\n\nJoin thousands of other Selectext users to save hours of time every day.\n\n➤ How it works\nSimply pause the video and click the Selectext toggle button that comes up in the top left corner. You can then select the text you want from the video and it will be automatically copied to your clipboard. Paste the text anywhere like your favourite note taking app or code editor.\n\n➤ Extra tips\nUse the keyboard shortcut instead of clicking the toggle and pausing the video to speed up the process even further - Alt+S on Windows or Option+S on Mac.\n\nSelectext has a customisable menu that allows you to personalise the extension to suit your needs. You can change how the text is displayed, or change how the text is copied to the clipboard. Indentation mode for copying code will preserve the indentation of the code. This is important for programming languages such as Python.\n\n➤ Supported languages and sites\nSelectext uses the latest AI Computer Vision (OCR) technology to detect the text in the video.\n\nIt supports detecting text in 50+ languages including English, Hindi, Turkish, French, Spanish and many more.\n\nSelectext works on all video sites including Youtube, Udemy, Coursera, Sharepoint, as well as social media sites and university / college lecture recordings.\n\n➤ Need help?\nCheck out the tutorial at: https://selectext.app/tutorial\n\nIf Selectext isn't working on a video site you use, or if you want a feature to be added, reach out via support@selectext.app."
