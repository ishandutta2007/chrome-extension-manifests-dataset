At present, we offer support for two major platforms: YouTube and Spotify. We are actively working on expanding our support to include additional platforms in the near future.\n\nOur extension provides two distinct methods of connectivity. The first method allows you to connect to the desktop application using a local RPC Websocket server. Alternatively, you can connect using the browser version of Nerimity with the help of this extension.\n\nWe are committed to providing a seamless user experience and we value your feedback. If you encounter any issues or if you have suggestions for features, we encourage you to report them on our GitHub Repository. Your input is instrumental in helping us improve our services.
